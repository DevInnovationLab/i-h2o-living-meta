"Probiotic treatment in an intensive care unit: a narrative review","Takeaki S.","Journal of Intensive Care","10.1186/s40560-025-00803-0","13","1","2025","Diarrhea is common in critically ill patients and can lead to malnutrition, electrolyte imbalance, and dehydration. While its direct impact on outcomes, such as mortality or intensive care unit (ICU) stay, remains unclear due to inconsistent definitions, it often results from drug-induced causes, such as antibiotics and antacids. These agents can also contribute to dysbiosis and increase the risk of infections including Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Probiotics, defined as live beneficial microorganisms, can counteract dysbiosis by modulating immune responses, restoring microbial balance, and reducing intestinal inflammation. Evidence suggests that probiotics may help prevent diarrhea and secondary infections. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that probiotics may reduce the incidence of VAP, length of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and potential in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients. However, evaluating probiotic efficacy remains challenging due to the lack of standardized markers and the influence of confounding factors like antacid use. In a randomized controlled trial, synbiotic therapy was associated with improved fecal microbiota and reduced infections; however, the role of antacids was not addressed. Probiotics are generally safe, although rare adverse events, such as probiotic-associated bacteremia, have been reported, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The 2024 Japanese Critical Care Nutrition Guidelines included a systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the potential benefits of probiotics in critically ill patients. However, due to significant heterogeneity in strains, dosing, duration, and concurrent antibiotic/antacid use, a weak recommendation (GRADE 2C; low certainty) was issued. Future research should focus on the standardized evaluation of diarrhea and microbiota changes, the use of objective markers—such as fecal pH and short-chain fatty acid levels—and clarification of the interactions of probiotics with other medications. Comprehensive bowel management, including the cautious use of antibiotics and antacids, may be essential to fully recognize the therapeutic potential of probiotics in critical care settings."
"Fecal microbiota transplantation for Parkinson's disease: A systematic review of clinical evidence","Shekar S., Venkatachalapathy R., Jayaraman A., Sai Supra Siddhu N.","Medicine in Microecology","10.1016/j.medmic.2025.100128","25",NA,"2025","Targeting the gut-brain axis, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has become a cutting-edge therapeutic strategy for treating Parkinson's disease (PD), reducing both motor and non-motor symptoms. With an emphasis on gut microbiota changes, disease progression, and symptom alleviation, this systematic review assesses the safety and effectiveness of FMT in PD patients. Four RCTs, one observational research, one non-randomized control study, one case series, and one case report were among the eight papers that were considered; these studies comprised 144 patients in total. Key findings show that FMT has a good safety profile with only mild to severe adverse effects observed, and it significantly improves PD symptoms, notably constipation. Colonic, Nasointestinal, and oral administration were among the delivery routes used to assess treatment effectiveness using the MDS-UPDRS scale. The research reveals differences in the makeup of microbiota and emphasizes how FMT may affect the gut-brain axis, hence resolving neurological abnormalities in Parkinson's disease. Small sample numbers, variations in FMT methods, and the absence of long-term follow-up data are some of the limitations. This study highlights FMT's potential as an adjunctive treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), especially in improving patient quality of life and reducing non-motor symptoms. To provide standardized procedures and validate long-term safety and effectiveness, bigger multicentre trials are necessary."
"Use of pectin-supplemented enteral nutrition in intensive care: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Huang H.-B., Zhu Y.-B., Yu D.-X.","Clinical Nutrition ESPEN","10.1016/j.clnesp.2025.04.008","68",NA,"2025","Background: Pectin is a water-soluble dietary fiber that has been widely used in hospitalized patients. However, there is insufficient high-quality evidence to support its use in critically ill patients. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pectin-supplemented enteral nutrition (PSEN) on diarrhea and other important outcomes in this patient population. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and the Cochrane database for relevant articles from inception to Oct 15, 2023. Studies were included if they focused on adult ICU patients receiving PSEN compared to controls. The primary outcome was diarrhea. We assessed study quality and performed subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, GRADE system and trial sequential analysis (TSA) to explore potential heterogeneity among the included studies. Results: Twelve trials with 1,405 patients were included. Overall, PSEN significantly reduced the risk of diarrhea (odds ratio [OR] = 0.40; 95 % CI, 0.30–0.54; P < 0.00001). This finding was confirmed in further subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Of note, PSEN significantly reduced the risk of diarrhea in patients who did not use PPIs but not in those who did. PSEN also significantly reduced infectious complications (OR = 0.43; 95 % CI, 0.26–0.70; P = 0.0007), ICU length of stay (MD = −3.59 days; 95 % CI, −7.13 to −0.05; P = 0.05), and hospital length of stay (MD = −6.79 days; 95 % CI, −10.24 to −3.34; P = 0.0001). In addition, PSEN significantly reduced intestinal intolerance symptoms (vomiting [OR = 0.27; 95 % CI, 0.15–0.48], feeding intolerance [OR = 0.39; 95 % CI, 0.22–0.68], abdominal distension [OR = 0.22; 95 % CI, 0.22–0.46] and severe constipation [OR = 0.20; 95 % CI, 0.12–0.35]) and nutrition status (shorter time to target EN amount [MD = −1.81 days; 95 % CI, −2.18 to −1.44] and prealbumin changes [MD = −1.81 days; 95 % CI, −2.18 to −1.44]) but did not affect mortality (OR = 0.86; 95 % CI, 0.56–1.33) in this patient population. TSA and sensitivity analyses confirmed the primary findings. Conclusions: PSEN significantly had better feeding intolerance, and improved important clinical outcomes. Further studies with better PSEN protocol are required to validate our findings."
"Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on pre-, pro-, post- and synbiotic supplementation in follow-on formula","Delcourt H., Verbrugghe L., Vandenplas Y., Huysentruyt K.","Clinical Nutrition","10.1016/j.clnu.2025.05.022","51",NA,"2025","Background & aim: The remarkable plasticity of the gut microbiome during the first three years of life offers a critical window of opportunity to influence gut health. The aim of this study is to summarize high quality evidence from randomized controlled trials on the health benefits (respiratory tract infections, diarrheal episodes, febrile days, antibiotic use, microbiome modulation and secretory IgA) of prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and postbiotics added to follow-on formula. Methods: A comprehensive literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using Medline, Embase, Lilacs, and Cochrane was performed up to February 2025 (PROSPERO CRD42024500457). Only RCTs involving healthy children between six months and three years were considered. Quality assessment was done using the ROBINS II tool. Random effects models were used to obtain odd ratio (OR) and number needed to treat (NNT) via meta-analysis. Results: Out of 2755 search results, 23 studies were included (n = 6984 children) with an overall low risk of bias (14/23) as assessed by the Robins II tool. The OR for respiratory tract infections in pro-,pre- and synbiotics added to a follow-on formula was 0.22 (95 % CI: 0.05–1.09; NNT = 82; CI 95 %: 67–674), 0.84 (95 % CI: 0.66–1.07; NNT = 28; 95 % CI: 11–75) and 0.75 (95 % CI: 0.54–1.05; NNT = 18; 95 % CI: 9–102), respectively. The OR for diarrheal episodes in pre- and synbiotics added to a follow-on formula 1.40 (95 % CI: 0.71–2.79; NNT = 40, 95 % CI: 10–53) and 1.26 (95 % CI: 0.96–1.66; NNT = 17, 95%CI: 8–94), respectively. For the combination of other interventions with other outcomes insufficient studies were available to perform a meta-analysis. Conclusion: Pre- and synbiotics may help protect against respiratory tract infection, though they do not appear to offer the same benefit for preventing diarrheal episodes. High quality evidence for the effect of biotics added to follow-on formula on health outcomes is sparse. More research is needed to confirm the observed health effects."
"Effect of long-term azithromycin treatment on gut microbial diversity in children and adolescents with HIV-associated chronic lung disease","Flygel T.T., Bargheet A., Abotsi R.E., Claassen-Weitz S., Simms V., Hjerde E., Mwaikono K.S., Mchugh G., Hameiri-Bowen D., Pettersen V.K., Ferrand R.A., Nicol M., Cavanagh J.P., Flaegstad T., Sovershaeva E.","eBioMedicine","10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105832","118",NA,"2025","Background: HIV-associated chronic lung disease (HCLD) is common in children and adolescents growing up with HIV. The use of azithromycin (AZM) reduces the rate of acute respiratory exacerbations in this population, however, impact of this treatment on the gut microbiota and associations with blood-derived inflammatory markers have not been studied. Methods: Children and adolescents with HCLD in Harare, Zimbabwe and Blantyre, Malawi were recruited in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of once-weekly AZM or placebo for 48 weeks (BREATHE trial, NCT02426112). Rectal swabs were collected at inclusion (N = 346), 48 weeks (treatment end, N = 313), and 72 weeks (six months after treatment cessation, N = 244). The bacterial composition of fecal swabs was determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Plasma biomarkers at inclusion and 48 weeks were measured using Luminex multiplex bead assay. Findings: At 48 weeks, bacterial α-diversity was significantly lower in the AZM group, with 27 bacterial genera showing differential abundance between the study groups. The placebo group exhibited higher interconnectivity between bacterial genera at 48 weeks compared to the AZM group. Correlations between the top seven differentially abundant genera and biomarkers observed at inclusion were no longer significant at 48 weeks in both groups. Depletion of Campylobacter persisted for six months after cessation of AZM treatment. Interpretation: Long-term AZM treatment in HCLD patients affects their gut bacterial composition at least 6 months after its cessation. The consequences of reduced bacterial diversity, such as altered interaction with the immune system and risk of resistance, need further investigation to understand how to optimise gut health during long-term antibiotic treatments. Funding: The study was funded by the Norwegian Research Council and Helse Nord (HNF 1387-17)."
"Reporting quality and evidence support in randomized controlled trials of herbal medicine formulas for vestibular migraine","Wang L., Zheng J., Yang J., Feng Q., Liu J., Lu Z., Zhang J., Zheng G.","Phytomedicine","10.1016/j.phymed.2025.156864","143",NA,"2025","Background: Vestibular migraine (VM) is a prevalent condition characterized by recurrent episodes of dizziness, vertigo, and/or headache, often posing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have highlighted potential benefits of herbal medicine formulas (HMFs) for treating VM. However, current evidence remains insufficient to recommend their routine clinical use. The validity of trial results relies heavily on the completeness of the reporting. Therefore, this study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the reporting quality and evidence support of RCTs investigating HMFs for VM. Methods: We performed a comprehensive search across eight databases from their inception to August 2024. The included studies were primarily RCTs assessing the effectiveness and safety of HMFs for treating VM. The quality of the RCTs was evaluated using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines, along with its extension for Chinese medicine formulas (CONSORT-CHM Formulas). A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of HMFs for the treatment of VM following the Cochrane methodolog. High-frequency herbal medicines (HMs) for VM treatment were identified as those appearing with a cumulative frequency exceeding 50 % among the top-ranked HMs. Results: A total of 33 RCTs involving 2358 patients with VM were included. The mean score for CONSORT reporting items was 14.24, while the mean score for CONSORT-CHM reporting items was 13.64. Few trials adequately reported essential elements such as appropriate titles, sample size calculations, allocation concealment, randomization implementation, and descriptions of blinding within the CONSORT core items. For CONSORT-CHM, less than half of the studies specified the formula names, dosage forms, and targeted traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) patterns in their titles and abstracts. Most studies demonstrated a high risk of bias, particularly regarding randomization sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding. The meta-analysis indicates that HMFs are effective in treating VM with minimal adverse effects; however, the high heterogeneity in certain outcomes suggests a potential risk of bias. The five most frequently used herbs across all studies were, in descending order: Gastrodiae Rhizoma, Rhizoma Pinelliae, Rhizoma Chuanxiong, Poria, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma. Conclusions: The meta-analysis supports the effectiveness and safety of HMFs for treating VM, with a low incidence of adverse events. However, the CONSORT and CONSORT-CHM reporting items were underreported. Future RCTs should strictly adhere to these guidelines to enhance reporting quality, ensuring full transparency in study design and methodolog. This study contributes to a more rigorous evidence base for HMFs in VM treatment. It aims to improve the quality of future RCTs involving herbal formulas for VM, enabling clinicians to make better-informed decisions."
"Efficacy and Safety of Mifepristone and Misoprostol Compared to Misoprostol Alone for the Resolution of Miscarriage and Intrauterine Fetal Death: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Pirrami R.G., Reinert J.P.","Annals of Pharmacotherapy","10.1177/10600280241289968","59","7","2025","Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of mifepristone and misoprostol together (intervention) compared to misoprostol alone (comparator) for the resolution of miscarriage and intrauterine fetal death. Data Sources: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology through July 2024 that evaluated the efficacy and safety of mifepristone and misoprostol together compared to misoprostol alone for the resolution of miscarriage and intrauterine fetal death through July 2024. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Primary endpoints were overall delivery success, 24-hour delivery success, and incidence of safety outcomes. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant, and heterogeneity was reported as the I(2) value. Data Synthesis: Twelve randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Overall delivery success was higher in the intervention group (0.73 [CI 0.64-0.82], P < 0.01). Twenty-four-hour delivery rate was higher (1.54 [CI 1.32-1.77], P = 0.06), and a shorter time to delivery interval (9.22-18.78 vs 15.47-37.1 hours) was observed in the intervention group. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were more frequent in the intervention group (0.04 [CI –0.03 to 0.12], P < 0.01). Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Mifepristone and misoprostol together demonstrated higher delivery success rates and comparable safety outcomes to misoprostol alone, demonstrating the potential of improving patient care and positively impacting the time to successful delivery for patients at the bedside. Conclusions: The use of mifepristone and misoprostol together for the resolution of miscarriage and intrauterine fetal death is warranted over the use of misoprostol alone."
"A Comprehensive Review and Meta-analysis on the Treatment of Acute Gastroenteritis in Children with a Bacillus clausii Preparation (Enterogermina(®))","Michel M.C., Pellegrino P.","Advances in Therapy","10.1007/s12325-025-03221-8","42","7","2025","Several probiotics have become guideline-recommended treatments for acute gastroenteritis in children, but no recommendation was made for Bacillus clausii preparations on the basis of too limited data. As available B. clausii preparations differ in regard to strain composition and pharmaceutical quality, we focused on the most frequently investigated preparation that is available under the brand name Enterogermina(®), which includes a combination of the O/C, SIN, N/R, and T strains. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis including several newer studies. We identified 11 randomized and three non-randomized controlled trials. A meta-analysis was performed for the three most often reported parameters in the randomized trials, i.e., duration of diarrhea, number of stools, and duration of hospital stay. Risk of bias was assessed using the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination criteria. Risk of bias of the randomized trials was classified as fair to good. The duration of diarrhea was reduced by 0.6 Hedge's g, the number of stools by 0.34 Hedge's g, and the duration of hospital stay by 0.27 Hedge's g (p < 0.05 for all three parameters). Several other parameters also appeared improved. Adverse events were absent or similarly present in the B. clausii and control groups. We conclude that the B. clausii preparation analyzed here is an effective and well-tolerated treatment of acute gastroenteritis in children. However, more high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed, particularly in comparison to other probiotics."

Benefits of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have been shown in phase I studies, but route and dose-related questions remain. Methods: We performed a phase II randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial of capsule and enema FMT in patients with cirrhosis and HE on lactulose and rifaximin. Participants were randomized into four groups (3 active doses; 2 active and 1 placebo dose; 1 active and 2 placebo doses; 3 placebo doses). Each patient received two capsules and one enema (either placebo or FMT) and were followed for 6 months. The primary outcome was FMT-related (serious) adverse events ([s]AEs)/AEs using intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes were HE recurrence, all-cause hospitalizations, death, donor engraftment, and quality-of-life. FMT was from a vegan or omnivorous donor. Results: We enrolled 60 patients (15/group) with similar baseline characteristics. FMT was safe, with no FMT-related SAEs/AEs reported. Overall SAEs (p = 0.96) or death (p = 1.0) were similar. There were significant differences in HE recurrence between groups (p = 0.035, Cramer's V = 0.39). On post hoc analysis, recurrence was highest in the all-placebo vs. any FMT group (40% vs. 9%; odds ratio 0.15, 95% CI 0.04–0.64). Within the FMT groups, HE recurrence rates were similar regardless of route, doses, or donor type. Quality of life improved in FMT-recipient groups. Engraftment was highest in those with high pre-FMT Lachnospiraceae and lower in those whose HE recurred. Conclusions: FMT was safe in patients with cirrhosis and HE on maximal therapy, with no FMT-related AEs reported, regardless of dose, route, or donor type. On post hoc analysis, HE recurrence was highest in the placebo-only group and linked with lower baseline Lachnospiraceae and reduced donor engraftment. Impact and implications: Patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) already on maximal therapy could have recurrences, which worsen prognosis and are not prioritized for liver transplant. In this phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with cirrhosis and prior overt HE, we found that fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) was safe and well tolerated regardless of route of delivery (oral or enema), number of doses (1 through 3), or donor type (vegan or omnivorous). HE recurrence, which was a key secondary endpoint, was different between groups and, on post hoc analysis, lowest in groups that received any FMT. Donor engraftment was higher in those with higher relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was associated with lower HE recurrence."
"The Effectiveness of Oral Vancomycin on Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Patients with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis: A Systematic Review","Arbabzada N., Dennett L., Meng G., Peerani F.","Inflammatory Bowel Diseases","10.1093/ibd/izae257","31","7","2025","Background Approximately 70% of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) patients have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The IBD therapies currently used to treat PSC-IBD patients have side effects and can be costly. Oral vancomycin (OV) - a safe, economical, and convenient therapy - has been reported to be a salvage therapy in refractory PSC-IBD patients. This systematic review aims to summarize the current literature regarding the effectiveness and safety of OV to treat IBD in PSC patients. Methods A systematic literature review of Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and CINAHL was performed until March 2024. The Murad scale, Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool were used to determine the quality of the case reports and case series, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trial (RCT), respectively. The outcomes sought were response or remission across clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, and histological parameters. Results Of the 1725 published studies, we identified 9 case reports, 7 case series, 3 cohort studies, and 1 RCT. Most studies reported an improvement in clinical IBD symptoms such as diarrhea and hematochezia. Fewer publications provided supporting objective data in the form of fecal calprotectin, endoscopic Mayo scores, and histology. There were no reports of vancomycin-resistant enterococci infections. Conclusions Oral vancomycin appears safe and effective to treat IBD in a subset of PSC patients. Future studies would benefit from prospective data collection incorporating standardized symptomatic, endoscopic, and histologic indices. Ultimately, a well-powered RCT is needed to better assess the effectiveness, safety, and durability of OV therapy."

Oral Chinese medicine, as the main treatment method of traditional Chinese medicine, is widely used in the treatment of gallstones. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese medicine combined with Western medicine for the treatment of gallstones. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), and Chinese BioMedical Literature Database. The search time was set to be up to July 2, 2024. Data analysis using Revman 5.3 software. The protocol is registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42024567327). Results: Ultimately, 912 patients from 8 randomized controlled trials were included. The meta-analysis results of traditional Chinese medicine combined with Western medicine versus Western medicine were as follows: imaging examination (standardized mean difference, SMD = -1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] (-2.36, -0.65), P < .001), total cholesterol level (SMD = -2.14, 95% CI (-3.61, -0.67), P = .004), total bile acid level (SMD = -0.97, 95% CI (-3.36, -1.42), P = .043), traditional Chinese medicine symptom scores (SMD = -1.88, 95% CI (-3.16, -0.60), P = .004), occurrence of adverse reaction (odds ratio = 0.51, 95% CI (0.21, 1.24), P = .14). Conclusion: The curative effect of Chinese medicine combined with Western medicine in the treatment of gallstones is better than that of Western medicine and is safety. Due to the limited quantity and quality of the included literature, more literature on double-blind randomized controlled trials with large samples is needed in the later stage to verify this conclusion."

Data Sources: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (January 2015 to May 2024). Search terms included: “cefepime-enmetazobactam” or “cefepime” or “enmetazobactam” or “cefepime” or “novel beta-lactamase inhibitor” and “complicated urinary tract infection” or “cUTI.” Conference abstracts, bibliographies, clinical trials, and drug monographs were included for review. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Relevant studies in English and clinical trials conducted in humans were reviewed. Data Synthesis: In February 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the combination beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (BL/BLI) FEP-EMT for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) and acute pyelonephritis following the completion of the Phase III ALLIUM trial comparing it to piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP). The trial resulted in 79.1% of the FEP-EMT group versus 58.9% of the TZP group meeting the primary outcome of clinical cure and microbiological eradication (95% CI 21.2 [14.3 to 27.9]). Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice in Comparison to Existing Agents: This review describes the use of FEP-EMT for the treatment of cUTI and compares its use to other novel BL/BLI combinations including utility in drug-resistant infections. Conclusions: FEP-EMT provides an antimicrobial option to reduce overuse of carbapenems for extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae. However, unlike other novel BL/BLI combinations, its limited spectrum of antibacterial effect for more difficult-to-treat pathogens and cost may also impact its overall utilization."
"Probiotics and Prebiotics Intervention in Respiratory and Digestive Infections Linked to Covid-19","Amrouche T., Lammi S., Drider D.","Probiotics and Antimicrobial Proteins","10.1007/s12602-024-10404-2","17","3","2025","Probiotics and prebiotics have been suggested as natural agents against viral infections and dysbiosis and may encourage clinical applications. This review aims to analyze the main and recent advances related to viral infections such as Covid-19 and its gastrointestinal complications, antiviral immunity generated and possible preventive role that probiotics and/or prebiotics can play in controlling and promoting antiviral immunity. The literature search was performed through a critical analysis of relevant publications reported in PubMed and Scopus databases on clinical trials and assays conducted in vitro on colon cells and in vivo on mice. Some studies using probiotics and prebiotics for the prevention of viral infection in different age groups are discussed. Covid-19 patients have been shown to suffer from gastrointestinal complications in addition to respiratory symptoms due to interactions between the respiratory system and the gastrointestinal tract infected with SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, therapies used to prevent (or treat) symptoms of Covid-19 have proven to be of limited effectiveness. In addition, the lack of access to coronavirus vaccines around the world and vaccine hesitancy continue to hamper control of Covid-19. It is therefore crucial to find alternative methods that can prevent disease symptoms. Evidence-based efficacy of certain probiotics (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) that may be useful in viral infections was shown with immunomodulatory properties (pro-inflammatory mediators reduction), promoting antiviral immunity (antibodies production, virus titers) and controlling inflammation (anti-inflammatory effect), as well as viral clearance and antimicrobial potential against opportunistic bacteria (anti-dysbiosis effect). But, available data about clinical application of probiotics in Covid-19 context remain limited and relevant scientific investigation is still in its early stages. Also, evidence for prebiotics potential in this field is limited, since the exact mechanism involved in systemic immune modulation by these compounds is till now unknown. Thus, further research is necessary to explore in the viral infection context the mechanism by which gut and lung interact in the presence of probiotics and prebiotics through more animal and clinical experiments."

In this systematic review we aimed to assess the desirable and undesirable patient-important effects of administering SDD to burn patients. Methods/design: We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of SDD versus placebo or no SDD in burn patients. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included serious adverse events, antimicrobial resistance, pneumonia, blood stream infections, ICU- and hospital-free days, and 90-day mortality. We searched all major databases and followed the recommendations provided by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The certainty of evidence was assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results: We identified four RCTs with a total of 457 burn patients. All trials were assessed as having either ‘some concerns’ or ‘high risk’ of bias. The evidence was found to be very uncertain across all outcomes assessed. For mortality, the relative risk (RR) was 0.62 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.22–1.78, I(2) = 75 %, random-effects model (REM), very low certainty evidence). For pneumonia, the RR was 0.75 (95 % CI 0.48–1.19, I(2) = 0 %, fixed-effect model, very low certainty evidence). For bloodstream infections, the RR was 1.10 (95 % CI 0.71–1.69, I(2) = 0 %, REM, very low certainty evidence). For hospital length of stay, the mean difference was −2.03 days (95 % CI −9.64–5.59, I(2) = 51 %, REM, very low certainty evidence). We did not perform meta-analyses for the remaining secondary outcomes due to limited or no data. Trial sequential analysis could not be performed due to insufficient number of total participants and events in the included trials. Conclusion: We found that the certainty of evidence is very low about the effects of SDD on patient-important outcomes in burn patients. Extrapolating from the evidence on mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients may be reasonable until more data from RCTs in burn patients emerge."

clinical outcomes associated with diarrhea in invasively ventilated patients in the ICU. DESIGN: Bedside nurses prospectively documented each patient's bowel movement (BM) using the Bristol Stool Chart type and number. Research Coordinators collected baseline and daily data evaluating risk factors for diarrhea and patient outcomes. The diarrhea definition was the World Health Organization definition of ≥3 loose or watery BMs (Bristol type 6 or 7) per day. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate risk factors and the association with the risk of death in the ICU. SETTING: Forty-four ICUs in Canada, the United States, and Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS: All 2,650 invasively ventilated critically ill patients were enrolled in this preplanned secondary analysis of a randomized trial that evaluated the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG on infectious outcomes. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 2,650 patients, the mean age (sd) was 59.8 (16.5) years, with an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II Score of 22.0 (7.8); 61.2% received inotropes/vasopressors on study day 1. Diarrhea occurred among 60.4% of patients and on 18.2% of ICU study days. Independent risk factors for diarrhea were a history of Clostridioides difficile infection, laxatives, and antibiotic use. Adjusted for these factors, enteral nutrition, particularly with moderate-high-protein content, also increased the risk of diarrhea. Univariable analysis suggested that diarrhea was associated with C. difficile testing, fecal management device insertion, and increased length of ICU and hospital stay. After adjusting for illness severity, mechanical ventilation, inotropes/vasopressors, renal replacement therapy, and severe infections, diarrhea was not associated with an increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhea is common among invasively ventilated patients. Risk factors include a history of C. difficile, use of antibiotics, laxatives, and enteral nutrition, particularly moderate-high-protein composition feeds."

However, comprehensive reviews integrating the diverse therapeutic effects of probiotics in human subjects have been limited. By analyzing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, this review provides a comprehensive overview of key developments in probiotic interventions targeting gut, liver, skin, vaginal, mental, and oral health. Emerging evidence supports the efficacy of specific probiotic strains and combinations in treating a wide range of disorders, from gastrointestinal (GI) and liver diseases to dermatological conditions, bacterial vaginosis, mental disorders, and oral diseases. We discuss the expanding understanding of microbiome-organ connections underlying probiotic mechanisms of action. While many clinical trials demonstrate significant benefits, we acknowledge areas requiring further large-scale studies to establish definitive efficacy and optimal treatment protocols. The review addresses challenges in standardizing probiotic research methodologies and emphasizes the importance of considering individual variations in microbiome composition and host genetics. Additionally, we explore emerging concepts such as the oral-gut-brain axis and future directions, including high-resolution microbiome profiling, host-microbe interaction studies, organoid models, and artificial intelligence applications in probiotic research. Overall, this review offers a comprehensive update on the current state of therapeutic probiotics across multiple domains of human health, providing insights into future directions and the potential for probiotics to revolutionize preventive and therapeutic medicine."

New generations of BASs show promising results; however, their efficacy remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase to assess randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to November 2023 to retrieve studies that measured the parameters before and after the administration of BASs. The outcomes assessed were cessation or improvement in diarrhea, fecal consistency, abdominal cramping, frequency of diarrhea, and adverse events. Risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model. Statistical analyses were conducted using RStudio version 4.1.2. The protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023445444). Seven RCTs with a total of 311 patients were included, of which 168 (54%) were randomized to BASs. Among BAS-treated patients, 101 (60.1%) received colesevelam, 40 (23.8%) received chenodeoxycholate, 18 (10.7%) received cholestyramine, and 9 (5.3%) received colestid. BASs were associated with a significant improvement in the cessation of diarrhea (RR 3.27; 95% CI 2.08 to 5.15; P ≤.05) and liquid stool to normal fecal consistency (RR 2.69; 95% CI 1.56 to 4.65; P ≤.05), as well as an increase in abdominal cramps (RR 5.27; 95% CI 1.21 to 22.93; P ≤.05). There were no differences in urgency, adverse events, or nausea between groups. These findings indicate that BASs are effective in the treatment of BAD, as indicated by the improvement or cessation of diarrhea episodes."

Methods: This study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guideline. For this systematic review, we used 3 databases for journal searches: PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. This study only included randomized controlled trials or open-label clinical trials. There was no year limit used in the journal search for this systematic review. Findings: Eighteen randomized controlled trials, with a total population of 12,259 patients, were included. Of 18 studies, 15 were used for network meta-analysis. Based on the results of the network meta-analysis, weight loss was found in phentermine/topiramate (mean difference [MD], −3.28; 95% CI, −4.47 to −2.09), semaglutide (MD, −2.92; 95% CI, −4.38 to −1.46), phentermine (MD, −2.31; 95% CI, −3.82 to −0.81), naltrexone/bupropion (MD, −1.68; 95% CI, −2.87 to −0.49), topiramate (MD, −1.67; 95% CI, −2.86 to −0.48), and orlistat (MD, −1.44; 95% CI, −2.32 to −0.55). There were no significant differences among the groups. However, compared with placebo, all oral obesity therapies provide better benefits in weight loss (MD, −2.12; 95% CI, −2.64 to −1.59; P ≤ 0.00001). Implications: Oral antiobesity drugs provide better weight loss than placebo. However, some side effects can be incurred by utilizing the drug for weight loss, especially related to the gastrointestinal system. Nonetheless, in clinical settings, consideration should be given to particular patients to reduce risk of side effects."

The aim of this review is to summarise the current data and evaluate the effectiveness of the neutropenic diet (ND) in adult haemato-oncological patients to provide a basis for practical guidelines. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in four electronic databases (Medline (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), EMBASE (Ovid) and Cochrane CENTRAL) to identify English and German randomised controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the effectiveness of an ND in adult haematological patients. The main endpoints were fever and systemic infections, gastrointestinal (GI) infections, mortality, nutritional status and hospitalisation length. Results: A total of five RCTs with 510 adult patients were included in this systematic review. All patients received high-dose chemotherapy in order to treat haemato-oncological malignancies. None of the analysed endpoints showed a significant advantage of the ND compared to the control group. Conclusions: An ND does not have a beneficial effect on infection rates, GI health, mortality or hospitalisation length for haemato-oncological patients. On the contrary, an ND tends to negatively affect the patient’s nutritional status; therefore, an adaption in clinical routine should take place."
"THE EFFECT OF CATECHOLAMINE VERSUS NONCATECHOLAMINE VASOPRESSORS ON RENAL FUNCTION AND RECOVERY IN VASODILATORY SHOCK: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL STUDIES","Vernon-Elliot J., Goradia S., Bellomo R., Lankadeva Y.R., Burrell L.M., See E.J.","Shock","10.1097/SHK.0000000000002515","63","3","2025","Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of vasodilatory shock. AKI is associated with an increased risk of death, prolonged hospital stays, and subsequent transition to chronic kidney disease. Catecholamines have historically been used as the first-line vasopressors for vasodilatory shock; however, they may adversely affect renal function and recovery. Objectives: To compare the effects of catecholamine and noncatecholamine vasopressors on AKI risk and recovery in preclinical and clinical studies of vasodilatory shock. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched to identify studies reporting renal outcomes associated with catecholamine (norepinephrine, epinephrine, metaraminol, phenylephrine, dopamine) and noncatecholamine vasopressors (vasopressin, angiotensin II), in preclinical models or adult cohorts of vasodilatory shock. Two independent reviewers screened studies and extracted data using a prespecified form for qualitative synthesis and risk of bias assessment. Results: Of 3,504 citations, 90 studies were eligible for inclusion: 41 preclinical studies, 17 nonrandomized clinical studies, 28 randomized clinical studies, and 4 post-hoc analyses. Risk of bias was generally low in preclinical studies and low to moderate in clinical studies. In preclinical studies, catecholamine vasopressors exacerbated medullary hypoxia and intrarenal inflammation compared to noncatecholamine vasopressors. In clinical studies, catecholamines were associated with higher serum creatinine, lower urine output, and increased requirements for renal replacement therapy compared to noncatecholamine vasopressors. In patients on high-dose catecholamines, adjunctive angiotensin II was associated with improved renal replacement therapy liberation. Conclusion: Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that noncatecholamine vasopressors may confer renal benefits compared to catecholamine vasopressors. These hypothesis-generating observations suggest the need for comparative studies focused on renal outcomes."
"Gut microbiota development in very preterm infants following fortification of human milk","Yang L., Hui Y., Sangild P.T., Kot W.P., Aunsholt L., Zachariassen G., Jiang P.-P., Nielsen D.S.","mSystems","10.1128/msystems.00916-24","10","3","2025","Very preterm infants (VPIs) are born with an immature gut and predisposed to gut microbiota dysbiosis-related diseases, for example, necrotizing enterocolitis. Although fortification of human milk is required for these infants, the optimal fortifier remains uncertain. Bovine colostrum (BC), rich in protein and bioactive components, could serve as an alternative to conventional fortifiers (CF). The gut microbiota (GM) of 225 VPIs fed human milk fortified with either BC or CF (FortiColos study, NCT03537365) was profiled by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of fecal samples collected before, and after 1 and 2 weeks of fortification. Birth mode exhibited transient effects on the microbial community structure shortly after birth, with cesarean section-born VPIs dominated by Firmicutes, whereas vaginally born VPIs were dominated by Proteobacteria. This birth mode-derived difference diminished with age and disappeared around 1 month after birth. Fortifier type affected the microbial community structure to a modest extent, but no specific taxa significantly differed between the BC and CF groups. Fecal pH, increased by BC, was positively correlated with Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium and negatively with Bifidobacterium abundance. Change in the relative abundance of Staphylococcus was negatively correlated with body weight gain. Collectively, fortification of human milk with BC or CF does influence the GM of VPIs but only to a modest extent during early life. Birth mode appears to have a significant, but temporary influence on the GM during this period. IMPORTANCE Early life is a key period for gut microbiota (GM) establishment, where enteral feeding plays a significant role. This is also the case for infants born preterm, who, due to their immature gut, are at a high risk of developing GM dysbiosis-related diseases. Human milk is the optimal feed for preterm infants, but it requires fortificationto reach adequate levels of especially protein. Only a few studies have investigated the impact of fortifiers on GM development in preterm infants. Here, we demonstrate that two different bovine milk-based fortifiers, bovine colostrum and a conventional fortifier based on mature bovine milk, exhibit limited effects on the microbial community structure of very preterm infants. These findings suggest that although great care in terms of optimally maturing the preterm infant GM should be taken, the choice of fortifier only has limited impact. In clinical practice, the choice of fortifier can thus be fully focussed on optimizing preterm infant nutrition."

This comprehensive review outlines the physiological metabolic functions of metformin and synthesizes existing literature and key knowledge gaps pertaining to the use of metformin in pregnancy across various end points in women with GDM. On the basis of current evidence, metformin reduces gestational weight gain, neonatal hypoglycaemia and macrosomia and increases insulin sensitivity. However, considerable heterogeneity between existing studies and the grouping of aggregate and often inharmonious data within meta-analyses has led to disparate findings regarding the efficacy of metformin in treating hyperglycaemia in GDM. Innovative analytical approaches with stratification by individual-level characteristics (for example, obesity, ethnicity, GDM severity and so on) and treatment regimens (diagnostic criteria, treatment timing and follow-up duration) are needed to establish efficacy across a range of end points and to identify which, if any, subgroups might benefit from metformin treatment during pregnancy."

The gut microbiome and diet are key environmental factors that influence the onset and progression of IBD and can be leveraged for treatment. In this review, we summarize the current evidence on the role of the gut microbiome and diet in IBD pathogenesis, and the potential of microbiome-directed therapies and dietary interventions to improve IBD outcomes. We discuss available data and the advantages and drawbacks of the different approaches to manipulate the gut microbiome, such as fecal microbiota transplantation, next-generation and conventional probiotics, and postbiotics. We also review the use of diet as a therapeutic tool in IBD, including the effects in induction and maintenance, special diets, and exclusive enteral nutrition. Finally, we highlight the challenges and opportunities for the translation of diet and microbiome interventions into clinical practice, such as the need for personalization, manufacturing and regulatory hurdles, and the specificity to take into account for clinical trial design."
"Exploring the Role of Vitamin C in Gastrointestinal Function and Disorders","Freid H., Shneyderman M., Mehra S., Bacharach A., Kohler D., Gold S.","Practical Gastroenterology",NA,"49","2","2025","Vitamin C, also known as L-Ascorbic Acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that cannot be synthesized by humans and is commonly found in many fruits and vegetables. Although vitamin C is traditionally known for its role in the immune system, this vitamin also has many other functions in the human body including as a cofactor in enzymatic reactions, supporting catecholamine production, and aiding tissue repair.(1) Of interest, vitamin C plays a role in almost every organ system, including the gastrointestinal tract. From the stomach to the pancreas, small intestine, liver and colon, vitamin C plays a role in the pathophysiology of many common disorders encountered by gastroenterologists. This review will focus on the role of vitamin C in many of these diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, including, but not limited to H. pylori associated peptic ulcer disease, pancreatic cancer, metabolic associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), constipation and inflammatory bowel disease."
"Differential Effectiveness of Water, Sanitation, and Handwashing Interventions to Reduce Child Diarrhea in Dry and Rainy Seasons: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Intervention Trials","Hubbard S., Wolf J., Oza H.H., Arnold B.F., Freeman M.C., Levy K.","Environmental Health Perspectives","10.1289/EHP14502","133","2","2025","BACKGROUND: Studies evaluating how water, sanitation, and/or handwashing (WASH) interventions in low-and middle-income countries impact diarrheal diseases have shown inconsistent results. The prevalence of enteric pathogen infections and diarrhea are highly seasonal and climate-sensitive, which could explain heterogeneous findings. Understanding how season influences the effectiveness of WASH interventions is critical for informing intervention approaches that will be resistant under the varying weather conditions that climate change will bring. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis to test whether and to what extent the impact of WASH interventions on diarrhea differs by season. We searched the literature for randomized and nonrandomized controlled WASH intervention trials and identified the season in which data were collected—rainy, dry, or both—for each study using proximate land station weather datasets. We compared the relative risk (RR) estimates for the impact of interventions on diarrhea for each study, stratified by season, and analyzed estimates using meta-analysis and meta-regression. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021231137. RESULTS: A total of 50 studies met the inclusion criteria, resulting in 34 drinking water intervention estimates, 8 sanitation intervention estimates, and 14 handwashing intervention estimates. Of the total studies, 60% (n = 30) spanned more than one season, with most single-season studies (75%, n = 15) occur-ring exclusively in the dry season. The effect of WASH interventions was stronger in dry seasons than in rainy seasons, with a 33% [95% confidence interval (CI): 24%, 41%] and 18% reduction (95% CI: 5%, 29%) in diarrhea risk, respectively. When stratified by type of intervention, the stronger effect size in dry seasons was consistent for water and handwashing interventions but not for sanitation interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of the seasonal impact of WASH interventions revealed larger effects in the dry season than in the rainy season overall and for water and handwashing interventions in particular. These patterns likely affected previous estimates of intervention effectiveness, which included more dry season estimates. These findings suggest the need to collect data across seasons and report seasonally stratified results to allow for more accurate estimates of the burden of disease impacted by WASH investments and to improve projections of potential impacts of these interventions under future climate conditions. These findings also underscore the need for robust WASH interventions designed to be resistant to seasonal variations in temperature and rainfall now and under future climate change scenarios."
"Efficacy of probiotic supplementation and impact on fecal microbiota in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","Xu M., Zhang W., Lin B., Lei Y., Zhang Y., Chen B., Mao Q., Kim J.J., Cao Q.","Nutrition Reviews","10.1093/nutrit/nuae022","83","2","2025","Context: Research regarding the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with probiotics has not yielded consistent results. Objective: The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics supplementation in patients with IBD. Data Sources: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of probiotics in patients with IBD were searched in PubMed, the Google Scholar database, Web of Science, and CrossRef for the period July 2003 to June 2023. Data Extraction: The RCTs were extracted, independently by 2 authors, according to the PICOS criteria. Data Analysis: Seven studies, including a total of 795 patients, met the study criteria. Five end points were selected to evaluate the efficacy. Of these, 3 indicators showed a statistically significant difference in efficacy: C-reactive protein (odds ratio [OR]: –2.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: –3.16, –1.73, P < .01), the number of fecal Bifidobacterium (OR: 3.37, 95% CI: 3.28, 3.47, P < .01), and Lactobacillus(OR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.91, 2.09, P < .01). The other 2 indicators (disease activity for Crohn’s disease and for ulcerative colitis) showed no statistically significant difference, while the OR reflected a positive correlation. Conclusion: Probiotics supplementation may have a positive effect on IBD by reducing clinical symptoms, reducing the serological inflammatory markers, and increasing favorable gut flora in patients with IBD. Additional RCTs are needed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of probiotics in IBD."

The purpose of this Part II follow-up article is to provide a systematic overview of the experimental psychopharmacology of ASD. To this aim, we have first identified in the Clinicaltrials.gov website all the 157 pharmacological and nutraceutical compounds which have been experimentally tested in children and adolescents with ASD using the randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) design. After excluding 24 drugs already presented in Part I, a systematic review spanning each of the remaining 133 compounds was registered on Prospero (ID: CRD42023476555), performed on PubMed (August 8, 2024), and completed with EBSCO, PsycINFO (psychology and psychiatry literature) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews, yielding a total of 115 published RCTs, including 57 trials for 23 pharmacological compounds and 48 trials for 17 nutraceuticals/supplements. Melatonin and oxytocin were not included, because recent systematic reviews have been already published for both these compounds. RCTs of drugs with the strongest foundation in preclinical research, namely arbaclofen, balovaptan and bumetanide have all failed to reach their primary end-points, although efforts to target specific patient subgroups do warrant further investigation. For the vast majority of compounds, including cannabidiol, vasopressin, and probiotics, insufficient evidence of efficacy and safety is available. However, a small subset of compounds, including N-acetylcysteine, folinic acid, L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, sulforaphane, and metformin may already be considered, with due caution, for clinical use, because there is promising evidence of efficacy and a high safety profile. For several other compounds, such as secretin, efficacy can be confidently excluded, and/or the data discourage undertaking new RCTs. Part I and Part II summarize “drug-based” information, which will be ultimately merged to provide clinicians with a “symptom-based” consensus statement in a conclusive Part III, with the overarching aim to foster evidence-based clinical practices and to organize new strategies for future clinical trials."

This study aimed to review the robotic and laparoscopic procedures for CRC performed in Africa, and compare the mean surgery duration, blood loss, hospital stay, rate of conversion, and prevalence of morbidity and mortality. This is the first study to compare the outcomes of robotic and laparoscopic surgeries for CRC in Africa. Methods: A systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines was conducted. PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, AJOL, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched, identifying 2,259 publications, 33 of which were deemed eligible. Statistical analysis of outcomes was performed using “R”. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane ROBINS-I tool. Results: The minimally invasive approach has been applied for CRC treatment in seven African countries: Algeria, Cameroon, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa. Laparoscopic surgeries accounted for 1,485 (95%) of cases, while 71 (5%) were robotic. Robotic procedures were associated with a longer surgery duration (256.41 min vs. 190.45 min, p < 0.0001), higher blood loss (226.48 mL vs. 141.55 mL, p < 0.0001), and a shorter hospital stay (4.52 days vs. 6.06 days, p = 0.85). Robotic procedures had a lower rate of conversion (3% vs. 8%, p = 0.29) and a lower prevalence of morbidity (19% vs. 26%, p = 0.26). Wound infection (24.49%) and ileus (57.14%) were the most common complications following laparoscopic and robotic procedures, respectively. There was no mortality from robotic surgeries; however, a prevalence of 0.39% (95% CI: 0;1.19) was recorded from laparoscopy. Conclusions: This study establishes and compares the outcomes of advances in the treatment of CRC in the African setting, providing insights for policymakers, healthcare providers, and international organizations to make decisions regarding optimizing care for CRC patients in Africa."

This systematic review aims to describe pathogens studied using MBAs, the operational implementation of MBAs, and how the data generated were synthesised. In November and December 2023, four databases were searched for studies utilising MBAs for the integrated serosurveillance of infectious diseases. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data regarding the study settings and population, methodology, seroprevalence results, and operational implementation elements. Overall, 4765 studies were identified; 47 were eligible for inclusion, of which 41% (n = 19) investigated multiple malaria species, and 14% performed concurrent surveillance of malaria in combination with other infectious diseases (n = 14). Additionally, 14 studies (29%) investigated a combination of multiple infectious diseases (other than malaria), and seven studies examined a combination of vaccine-preventable diseases. Haiti (n = 8) was the most studied country, followed by Ethiopia (n = 6), Bangladesh (n = 3), Kenya (n = 3), and Tanzania (n = 3). Only seven studies were found where integrated serosurveillance was the primary objective. The synthesis of data varied and included the investigation of age-specific seroprevalence (n = 25), risk factor analysis (n = 15), and spatial analysis of disease prevalence (n = 8). This review demonstrated that the use of MBAs for integrated surveillance of multiple pathogens is gaining traction; however, more research and capabilities in lower- and middle-income countries are needed to optimise and standardise sample collection, survey implementation, and the analysis and interpretation of results. Geographical and population seroprevalence data can enable targeted public health interventions, highlighting the potential and importance of integrated serological surveillance as a public health tool."

Probiotics have been found to provide several benefits to hosts via modulation of the gut microbiota and their metabolites. However, till now, no conventional probiotics have been clearly proven to be an effective prophylactic option for CDI prevention. Therefore, more studies on developing specific probiotic candidates targeting CDI and improving diversity of probiotics administrated are needed. In this study, a human-origin highly diverse and highly targeted probiotic cocktail (Pro11) containing 11 various probiotic species was developed against C. difficile. Pro11 protected mice against CDI with lower clinical scores and higher survival rates, and inhibited C. difficile in vivo with less C. difficile burden and toxins production determined in colon. Histological analysis demonstrated that Pro11 strengthened gut barrier, reducing gut permeability (less secreted sCD14 in serum) and gut inflammation. In addition, gut microbiome analysis demonstrated that Pro11 increased gut microbiome diversity and beneficial species. Along with gut microbiome modulation, gut metabolites including butyrate, were significantly increased in the probiotics-fed group. Results from this study highlighted probiotics as a promising CDI therapy as gut microbiota modulators, which will lay the foundation for translating probiotics in mitigating CDI and other intestinal pathogens for clinical use."

In addition to neurobehavioral symptoms, children with ASD often have gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. constipation, diarrhea, gas, abdominal pain, reflux). Several studies have proposed the role of gut microbiota and metabolic disorders in gastrointestinal symptoms and neurodevelopmental dysfunction in ASD patients; these results offer promising avenues for novel treatments of this disorder. Interventions targeting the gut microbiota–such as fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), microbiota transplant therapy (MTT), probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, antifungals, and diet–promise to improve gut health and can potentially improve neurological symptoms. The modulation of the gut microbiota using MTT in ASD has shown beneficial and long-term effects on GI symptoms and core symptoms of autism. Also, the modulation of the gut microbiota to resemble that of typically developing individuals seems to be the most promising intervention. As most of the studies carried out with MTT are open-label studies, more extensive double-blinded randomized control trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of MTT as a therapeutic option for ASD. This review examines the current clinical research evidence for the use of interventions that target the microbiome–such as antibiotics, antifungals, probiotics/prebiotics, synbiotics, and MTT–and their effectiveness in changing the gut microbiota and improving gastrointestinal and neurobehavioral symptoms in ASD."

As understanding of viral transmission improves, infection prevention and control (IPC) policies need to be updated. Aim: To compare the effectiveness of soap and water alone to bleach-based cleaners in eliminating SARS-CoV-2 infection in households and community settings. Setting: We conducted a virtual search through the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane database of systematic reviews, PubMed, EMBASE, and Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC). Methods: We assessed studies which compared the effect of soap and water cleaning on SARS-CoV-2 among humans to that of bleach-based cleaning, both in households and communities. We prioritised systematic reviews and randomised studies and only included other study designs, such as laboratory studies, which had interventions of relevant interest. Results: We retrieved 1192 articles from the search. We summarised evidence from three laboratory studies as there were no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or comparative effectiveness studies that met our inclusion criteria. Indirect evidence suggests that soap and bleach-based cleaners were effective at different concentrations. Substantial heterogeneity between the cited studies precludes any inference on effectiveness in reducing risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Both interventions remain important components of IPC measures. Conclusion: There was no evidence for comparison of soap and water versus bleach-based cleaners against SARS-CoV-2 in humans in household and community settings. Indirect evidence shows both interventions to be effective against the virus. Contributions: Primary studies addressing this critical question are required to guide public health recommendations and policies."

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety of fluralaner on mammals given its increasing use. The search was performed in GoogleScholar and the SciFinder databases using the terms ‘fluralaner’ and ‘Bravecto(TM)’, and was concluded on 30th August, 2024. A total of 250 references were initially saved and reduced to 121 peer-reviewed journal articles using PRISMA guidelines, based on the removal of duplicates, those published in low quality journals (ranked less than Q2), and limiting publications to clinical trials. Articles were then categorised and ranked using the level of evidence, Cochrane ‘risk of bias’ assessment tool, methodological quality, and study size. Overall, the efficacy of fluralaner has been assessed on 14 mammalian species, and pharmacokinetic investigations conducted on 15. Fluralaner was mostly effective at treating some ectoparasites on captive individuals when there was little chance of re-infection; however, it did not prevent bites from blood-sucking ectoparasites and could not prevent blood-borne pathogen transfer to host animals. Very few studies have investigated the pharmacokinetics of fluralaner, and hence were difficult to compare; however, wombats differed greatly from their eutherian counterparts in their C(max) and t½ values and require further investigation. Overall, fluralaner was deemed moderately safe; however, most studies were classified as fair in terms of quality and most studies were based on small or very small sample numbers. Nineteen studies reported side effects, one of which included signs of severe neurological toxicity, with most of the articles not reporting on safety either positively or negatively. Concerns were raised regarding the extended time fluralaner was detected in faeces and subsequently environmental contamination is a concern. No longer-term impacts of the use of fluralaner have been investigated, and wider implications of the use of this ectoparasiticide have not yet been assessed."

The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy for each antibiotic. Methods: Only randomized clinical trials of patients being treated for Clostridioides disease infection were included. Studies were sought in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization clinical trials register portal (up to December 9, 2022). Sustained clinical cure was the outcome of treatment comparison, defined as the resolution of diarrhea without recurrence. Vancomycin was the standard treatment comparator. Meta-analysis was performed for each antibiotic. The overall certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE)—classified as either high, moderate, low, or very low. Results: Fourteen eligible studies were included in the meta-analysis with 4837 patients from 773 sites. Cadazolid did not increase sustained clinical cure relative to vancomycin (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.96–1.13; moderate-certainty evidence). Fidaxomicin demonstrated a significant increase (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07–1.21; low-certainty evidence). In one phase 2 study, ridinilazole demonstrated a significant increase in sustained clinical cure (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01–2.91; very low-quality evidence). Surotomycin did not show significant improvement (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96–1.14; moderate-certainty evidence). Conclusions: Fidaxomicin (in seven studies) demonstrated significant improvement in achieving sustained clinical cure. A limitation of this study may that more studies are needed to compare fidaxomicin with other antibiotics."

Here we show that pair matching by geographic location leads to substantial gains in statistical efficiency for 14 child health outcomes that span growth, development, and infectious disease through a re-analysis of two large-scale trials of nutritional and environmental interventions in Bangladesh and Kenya. Relative efficiencies from pair matching are ≥1.1 for all outcomes and regularly exceed 2.0, meaning an unmatched trial would need to enroll at least twice as many clusters to achieve the same level of precision as the geographically pair matched design. We also show that geographically pair matched designs enable estimation of fine-scale, spatially varying effect heterogeneity under minimal assumptions. Our results demonstrate broad, substantial benefits of geographic pair matching in large-scale, cluster randomized trials."

Along the lines of these advances, both public awareness and acceptance of probiotics are increasing. That’s why; academic and industrial research is dedicated to identifying and investigating new microbial strains for the development of next-generation probiotics (NGPs). At this time, there is a growing interest in NGPs as biotherapeutics that alter the gut microbiome and affect various diseases development. In this work, we have focused on some emergent and promising NGPs, specifically Eubacterium hallii, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia spp., Akkermansia muciniphila, and Bacteroides fragilis, as their presence in the gut can have an impact on the development of various diseases. Emerging studies point out the beneficial roles of these NGPs and open up novel promising therapeutic options. Interestingly, these NGPs were found to enhance gastrointestinal immunity, enhance immunotherapy efficacy in cancer patients, retain the intestinal barrier integrity, generate valuable metabolites, especially short-chain fatty acids, and decrease complications of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although many of these NGPs are considered promising for the prevention and treatment of several chronic diseases, research on humans is still lacking. Therefore, approval of these microbes from regulatory agencies is rare. Besides, some issues limit their wide use in the market, such as suitable methods for the culture and storage of these oxygen-sensitive microbes. The present review goes over the main points related to NGPs and gives a viewpoint on the key issues that still hinder their wide application. Furthermore, we have focused on the advancement in NGPs and human healthiness investigations by clarifying the limitations of traditional probiotic microorganisms, discussing the characteristics of emerging NGPs and defining their role in the management of certain ailments. Future research should emphasize the isolation, mechanisms of action of these probiotics, safety, and clinical efficacy in humans."

The most common DGBI are irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional constipation (FC) and functional dyspepsia (FD). Recently, a deep understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in these diseases was possible due to multi-omics methods capable to provide a comprehensive assessment. Most of the therapies recommended for these patients, can modulate the gut microbiota such as diet, prebiotics, probiotics and non-absorbable antibiotics, which were shown to be safe and effective. Since patients complain symptoms after food ingestion, diet represents the first line therapeutic approach. Avoiding dietary fat and fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, and increasing the number of soluble fibers represent the therapeutic choices for FD, IBS and FC respectively. Probiotics, as a category, have been employed with good results in all the abovementioned DGBI. Rifaximin has been shown to be useful in the context of bowel related disorders, although a recent trial showed positive results for FD. Fecal microbiota transplantation has been tested for IBS and FC with promising results. In this review, we will briefly summarize the current understanding on dysbiosis and discuss microbiota modulation strategies to treat patients with DGBI."

"Antibiofilm Effects of Novel Compounds in Otitis Media Treatment: Systematic Review","Jotic A., Savic Vujovic K., Cirkovic A., Božić D.D., Brkic S., Subotic N., Bukurov B., Korugic A., Cirkovic I.","International Journal of Molecular Sciences","10.3390/ijms252312841","25","23","2024","Otitis media (OM) is a frequent disease with incidence rate of 5300 cases per 100,000 people. Recent studies showed that polymicrobial biofilm formation represents a significant pathogenic mechanism in recurrent and chronic forms of OM. Biofilm enables bacteria to resist antibiotics that would typically be recommended in guidelines, contributing to the ineffectiveness of current antimicrobial strategies. Given the challenges of successfully treating bacterial biofilms, there is an growing interest in identifying novel and effective compounds to overcome antibacterial resistance. The objective of this review was to provide an overview of the novel compounds with antibiofilm effects on bacterial biofilm formed by clinical isolates of OM. The systematic review included studies that evaluated antibiofilm effect of novel natural or synthetic compounds on bacterial biofilm formed from clinical isolates obtained from patients with OM. The eligibility criteria were defined using the PICOS system: (P) Population: all human patients with bacterial OM; (I) Intervention: novel natural or synthetic compound with biofilm effect; (C) Control standard therapeutic antimicrobial agents or untreated biofilms, (O) Outcome: antibiofilm effect (biofilm inhibition, biofilm eradication), (S) Study design. The PRISMA protocol for systematic reviews and meta-analysis was followed. From 3564 potentially eligible studies, 1817 duplicates were removed, and 1705 were excluded according to defined exclusion criteria. A total of 41 studies with available full texts were retrieved by two independent authors. Fifteen articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review which included 125 patients with OM. A total of 17 different novel compounds were examined, including N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), tea tree oil, xylitol, eugenol, Aloe barbadensis, Zingiber officinale, Curcuma longa, Acacia arabica, antisense peptide nucleic acids, probiotics Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus oralis, Sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNA), bioactive glass, green synthesized copper oxide nanoparticles, radish, silver nanoparticles and acetic acid. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly studied pathogen, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. Biofilm inhibition only by an examined compound was assessed in six studies; biofilm eradication in four studies, and both biofilm inhibition and biofilm eradication were examined in five studies. This systematic review indicates that some compounds like NAC, prebiotics, nanoparticles and MESNA that have significant effects on biofilm are safe and could be researched more extensively for further clinical use. However, a lack of data about reliable and efficient compounds used in therapy of different types of otitis media still remains in the literature."

Objective: To evaluate the effects of an invitation to screen for H pylori on gastric cancer incidence and mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: A pragmatic randomized clinical trial of residents aged 50 to 69 years in Changhua County, Taiwan, eligible for biennial fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) for colon cancer screening. Participants were randomized to either an invitation for H pylori stool antigen (HPSA) + FIT assessment or FIT alone. The study was conducted between January 1, 2014, and September 27, 2018. Final follow-up occurred December 31, 2020. Intervention: Invitation for testing for H pylori stool antigen. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were gastric cancer incidence and gastric cancer mortality. All invited individuals were analyzed according to the groups to which they were randomized. Results: Of 240000 randomized adults (mean age, 58.1 years [SD, 5.6]; 46.8% female), 63508 were invited for HPSA + FIT, and 88995 were invited for FIT alone. Of the 240000 randomized, 38792 who were unreachable and 48705 who did not receive an invitation were excluded. Of those invited, screening participation rates were 49.6% (31497/63508) for HPSA + FIT and 35.7% (31777/88995) for FIT alone. Among 12142 participants (38.5%) with positive HPSA results, 8664 (71.4%) received antibiotic treatment, and eradication occurred in 91.9%. Gastric cancer incidence rates were 0.032% in the HPSA + FIT group and 0.037% in the FIT-alone group (mean difference, -0.005% [95% CI, -0.013% to 0.003%]; P =.23). Gastric cancer mortality rates were 0.015% in the HPSA + FIT group and 0.013% in the FIT-alone group (mean difference, 0.002% [95% CI, -0.004% to 0.007%]; P =.57). After adjusting for differences in screening participation, length of follow-up, and patient characteristics in post hoc analyses, an invitation for HPSA + FIT was associated with lower rates of gastric cancer (0.79 [95% CI, 0.63-0.98]) but not with gastric cancer mortality (1.02 [95% CI, 0.73-1.40]), compared with FIT alone. Among participants who received antibiotics, the most common adverse effects were abdominal pain or diarrhea (2.1%) and dyspepsia or poor appetite (0.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among residents of Taiwan, an invitation to test for HPSA combined with FIT did not reduce rates of gastric cancer or gastric cancer mortality, compared with an invitation for FIT alone. However, when differences in screening participation and length of follow-up were accounted for, gastric cancer incidence, but not gastric cancer mortality, was lower in the HSPA + FIT group, compared with FIT alone.

"Advances in the mechanism of action of short-chain fatty acids in psoriasis","Zhang Q., Zhao L., Li Y., Wang S., Lu G., Wang H.","International Immunopharmacology","10.1016/j.intimp.2024.112928","141",NA,"2024","Psoriasis is a prevalent chronic inflammatory and immunological disorder. Its lesions are present as scaly erythema or plaques. Disruptions in the body's immune system play a significant role in developing psoriasis. Recent evidence suggests a potential role of the gut microbiome in autoimmune diseases. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the primary metabolites created by gut microbes and play a crucial fuction in autoimmunity. SCFAs act on various cells by mediating signaling to participate in host physiological and pathological processes. These processes encompass body metabolism, maintenance of intestinal barrier function, and immune system modulation. SCFAs can regulate immune cells to enhance the body's immune function, potentially influencing the prevention and treatment of psoriasis. However, the mechanisms underlying the role of SCFAs in psoriasis remain incompletely understood. This paper examines the relationship between SCFAs and psoriasis, elucidating how SCFAs influence the immune system, inflammatory response, and gut barrier in psoriasis. According to the study, in psoriasis, SCFAs have been shown to regulate neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells in the adaptive immune system, as well as T and B cells in the innate immune system. Additionally, we explore the role of SCFAs in psoriasis by maintaining intestinal barrier function, restoring intestinal ecological homeostasis, and investigating the potential therapeutic benefits of SCFAs for psoriasis."

Despite decades of research efforts, a specific treatment is currently lacking, and preventive strategies are the mainstays of care. This review aims to help understand the complex interplay between gut microbiota and their metabolites in NEC pathogenesis. In particular, we focused on how these factors can influence gut health, immune responses, and intestinal barrier integrity. Discussion: Current research has increasingly focused on the role of the gut microbiota and their metabolites in NEC pathogenesis, thanks to their involvement in modulating gut health, immune responses, and intestinal barrier integrity. Conclusions: A deeper understanding of the interplay between gut microbiota and their metabolites is essential for developing personalized strategies to prevent NEC. By targeting these microbial interactions, new therapeutic approaches may emerge that offer improved outcomes for preterm infants at a high risk of NEC."

This mini-review delves into the intricate roles and mechanisms of the GM in these conditions, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiota. The review elucidates the diversity and development of the human GM, highlighting its pivotal functions in host physiology, including nutrient absorption, immune regulation, and energy metabolism. Studies show that GM dysbiosis is linked to increased energy extraction, altered metabolic pathways, and inflammation, contributing to obesity, MS, and T2D. The interplay between dietary habits and GM composition is explored, underscoring the influence of diet on microbial diversity and metabolic functions. Additionally, the review addresses the impact of common medications and therapeutic interventions like fecal microbiota transplantation on GM composition. The evidence so far advocates for further research to delineate the therapeutic potential of GM modulation in mitigating obesity and metabolic diseases, emphasizing the necessity of clinical trials to establish effective and sustainable treatment protocols."

Despite the known risks of dietary supplements, including hepatotoxicity, adulteration, and contamination, patients with chronic liver disease often turn to dietary supplements to support their liver and/or overall health but are not necessarily empowered with the information or guidance from their liver practitioner to do so. This article provides practitioners with a framework for balancing the risks and benefits of dietary supplements in patients with chronic liver disease, offering examples of independent resources and certifications to use this framework in clinical practice. We offer 3 common clinical scenarios to highlight how the use of this framework can improve communication and decision-making in clinical practice. By adapting principles from Integrative Medicine, this article advocates for a patient-centered approach to dietary supplements in patients with chronic liver disease, encouraging open dialogue between clinicians and their patients to facilitate informed decision-making and personalized care."
"Interventions for preventing the progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease","St Pierre K., Cashmore B.A., Bolignano D., Zoccali C., Ruospo M., Craig J.C., Strippoli G.F.M., Mallett A.J., Green S.C., Tunnicliffe D.J.","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","10.1002/14651858.CD010294.pub3","2024","10","2024","Background: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the leading inherited cause of kidney disease. Clinical management has historically focused on symptom control and reducing associated complications. Improved understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in kidney cyst growth and disease progression has resulted in new pharmaceutical agents targeting disease pathogenesis and preventing disease progression. However, the role of disease-modifying agents for all people with ADPKD is unclear. This is an update of a review first published in 2015. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions to prevent the progression of ADPKD and the safety based on patient-important endpoints, defined by the Standardised Outcomes in NephroloGy-Polycystic Kidney Disease (SONG-PKD) core outcome set, and general and specific adverse effects. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplants Register of Studies up to 13 August 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any interventions for preventing the progression of ADPKD with other interventions, placebo, or standard care were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed study risks of bias and extracted data. Summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Main results: We included 57 studies (8016 participants) that investigated 18 pharmacological interventions (vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R) antagonists, antihypertensive therapy, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, somatostatin analogues, antiplatelet agents, eicosapentaenoic acids, statins, kinase inhibitors, diuretics, anti-diabetic agents, water intake, dietary intervention, and supplements) in this review. Compared to placebo, the V2R antagonist tolvaptan probably preserves eGFR (3 studies, 2758 participants: MD 1.26 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 95% CI 0.73 to 1.78; I(2) = 0%) and probably slows total kidney volume (TKV) growth in adults (1 study, 1307 participants: MD -2.70 mL/cm, 95% CI -3.24 to -2.16) (moderate certainty evidence). However, there was insufficient evidence to determine tolvaptan’s impact on kidney failure and death. There may be no difference in serious adverse events; however, treatment probably increases nocturia, fatigue and liver enzymes, may increase dry mouth and thirst, and may decrease hypertension and urinary and upper respiratory tract infections. Data on the impact of other therapeutic interventions were largely inconclusive. Compared to placebo, somatostatin analogues probably decrease TKV (6 studies, 500 participants: SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.16; I(2) = 11%), probably have little or no effect on eGFR (4 studies, 180 participants: MD 4.11 mL/min/1.73 m(3), 95% CI -3.19 to 11.41; I(2) = 0%) (moderate certainty evidence), and may have little or no effect on kidney failure (2 studies, 405 participants: RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.49; I(2) = 39%; low certainty evidence). Serious adverse events may increase (2 studies, 405 participants: RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.25; low certainty evidence). Somatostatin analogues probably increase alopecia, diarrhoea or abnormal faeces, dizziness and fatigue but may have little or no effect on anaemia or infection. The effect on death is unclear. Targeted low blood pressure probably results in a smaller per cent annual increase in TKV (1 study, 558 participants: MD -1.00, 95% CI -1.67 to -0.33; moderate certainty evidence) compared to standard blood pressure targets, had uncertain effects on death, but probably do not impact other outcomes such as change in eGFR or adverse events. Kidney failure was not reported. Data comparing antihypertensive agents, mTOR inhibitors, eicosapentaenoic acids, statins, vitamin D compounds, metformin, trichlormethiazide, spironolactone, bosutinib, curcumin, niacinamide, prescribed water intake and antiplatelet agents were sparse and inconclusive. An additional 23 ongoing studies were also identified, including larger phase III RCTs, which will be assessed in a future update of this review. Authors' conclusions: Although many interventions have been investigated in patients with ADPKD, at present, there is little evidence that they improve patient outcomes. Tolvaptan is the only therapeutic intervention that has demonstrated the ability to slow disease progression, as assessed by eGFR and TKV change. However, it has not demonstrated benefits for death or kidney failure. In order to confirm the role of other therapeutic interventions in ADPKD management, large RCTs focused on patient-centred outcomes are needed. The search identified 23 ongoing studies, which may provide more insight into the role of specific interventions."

VS-505 (AP301), an acacia and ferric oxyhydroxide polymer, is a novel fiber-iron-based phosphate binder. This two-part Phase 2 study evaluated the tolerability, safety and efficacy of oral VS-505 administered three times daily with meals in treating hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). Methods. In Part 1, patients received dose-escalated treatment with VS-505 2.25, 4.50 and 9.00 g/day for 2 weeks each, guided by serum phosphorus levels. In Part 2, patients received randomized, open-label, fixed-dosage treatment with VS-505 (1.50, 2.25, 4.50 or 6.75 g/day) or sevelamer carbonate 4.80 g/day for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in serum phosphorus. Results. The study enrolled 158 patients (Part 1: 25; Part 2: 133), with 130 exposed to VS-505 in total. VS-505 was well tolerated. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders, mainly feces discolored (56%) and diarrhea (15%; generally during Weeks 1–2 of treatment). Most gastrointestinal disorders resolved without intervention, and none was serious. In Part 1, serum phosphorus significantly improved (mean change −2.0 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval −2.7, −1.4) after VS-505 dose escalation. In Part 2, serum phosphorus significantly and dose-dependently improved in all VS-505 arms, with clinically meaningful reductions with VS-505 4.50 and 6.75 g/day, and sevelamer carbonate 4.80 g/day [mean change −1.6 (−2.2, −1.0), −1.8 (−2.4, −1.2) and −1.4 (−2.2, −0.5) mg/dL, respectively]. In both parts, serum phosphorus reductions occurred within 1 week of VS-505 initiation, returning to baseline within 2 weeks of VS-505 discontinuation. Conclusion. VS-505, a novel phosphate binder, was well tolerated with a manageable safety profile, and effectively and dose-dependently reduced serum phosphorus in CKD patients with hyperphosphatemia receiving MHD."

Objectives: To review the published literature to determine which tendon sheaths are commonly affected by non-septic tenosynovitis and to describe the most frequently reported pathological lesions, outcomes, and surgical complications in equine non-septic tenosynovitis. Study design: Systematic review. Methods: Literature searches were conducted in July 2021 from the online search engines PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science Core, VetMed Resource and ProQuest Theses & Dissertations. The inclusion criteria followed a participants, interventions, comparisons, outcome and study design (PICOS) approach. For inclusion, studies had to include live equids with non-septic tenosynovitis of any tendon sheath. Studies were excluded if they only described non-equine species, if they included data only on non-tendon sheath structures, or if they included data exclusively on cases of septic or contaminated tendon sheaths. Determination of non-sepsis relied on the diagnosis of the original authors; however, if non-sepsis was not explicitly specified, then cases that had a history of contamination of the sheath, a wound near the sheath or a positive bacterial culture were excluded from analysis. Data analysed included the distribution of structures affected by non-septic tenosynovitis, the most common pathological lesions identified within each sheath, and the most frequently reported surgical complications of non-septic tenosynovitis. The quality of each study was assessed using a methodological quality analysis. Results: A total of 85 studies describing non-septic tenosynovitis in the horse were included. Across all 85 studies, there were a total of 2449 tendon sheaths in 2101 horses reported to be affected by non-septic tenosynovitis. The digital flexor sheath was the most reported structure to be diagnosed with non-septic tenosynovitis: 41/85 (48%) studies examined the digital flexor sheath exclusively, followed by the carpal flexor sheath, tarsal flexor sheath, carpal extensor sheaths, tarsal extensor sheaths, and one case of biceps brachii non-septic tenosynovitis. For most tendon sheaths, the most common pathological lesion was an intrathecal tear of a soft tissue structure, including tears of the deep digital flexor tendon and tears of the manica flexoria. Bilateral disease was most common in the carpal flexor sheath, where distal radial physeal exostoses were the most common pathological lesions. Less common causes of non-septic tenosynovitis included neoplasia, fracture of a bone adjacent to a tendon sheath, and mineralisation of an intrathecal tendon. The likelihood of return to previous level of athletic function following non-septic tenosynovitis of most structures was approximately 50%, and the most common complication was persistent effusion following tenoscopy. While iatrogenic infection following surgery was uncommon, it was most likely following tenoscopy of the digital flexor sheath. Conclusion: Non-septic tenosynovitis is commonly reported in equine athletes, with intra-thecal tears of the deep digital flexor tendon, superficial digital flexor tendon and manica flexoria frequently reported. Directions for future research include more thorough assessment of and reporting of complications following non-septic tenosynovitis and correlation of characteristics of intrathecal pathological lesions with clinical outcomes."

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate current evidence of the effect of GB consumption as a complement to standard treatment in the population with acute or persistent diarrhea. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and LILACS from inception to January 2024; there was no language restriction. Only randomized controlled trials using GB as an intervention were included, and studies using antidiarrheal medication were excluded. A meta-analysis was performed to compare the effect of GB on the resolution of acute and persistent diarrhea. To measure the certainty of evidence, the GRADE assessment was used. Nine randomized controlled trials (seven open and two blinded) were included. Studies were conducted in the pediatric population comprising a total of 3996 patients aged 8 to 34 months, eight studies were written in English and one in Spanish. GB-based food consumption significantly increased the hazard of resolution of diarrhea compared to standard treatment (HR 1.96, 95% CI [1.62; 2.37], p < 0.01; I(2) = 52%). The subgroup analysis showed a higher hazard of resolution of diarrhea for children with persistent diarrhea (HR 2.34, 95% CI [1.78; 3.08] compared to acute diarrhea (HR 1.74, 95% CI [1.45; 2.09]). Conclusions: The use of green banana-based foods as a complement to standard treatment in children is probably associated with a faster resolution in acute diarrhea and may aid in the treatment of persistent diarrhea. More clinical trials are necessary to assess if a synergistic effect between GB and other foods exists and proves to be better than GB alone. These findings need to be confirmed in diverse socioeconomic contexts, within the adult population, and under varying health conditions Trial registration: CRD42024499992."

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of licorice formulations, alone or in combination with other herbs, on liver function enzymes in patients with primary liver disease. We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to April 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of Glycyrrhiza spp. preparations versus placebo or standard of care controls were included. Standard Cochrane methods were used to extract data and appraise eligible studies. A total of 15 RCTs, involving 1367 participants, were included in the analysis. The studies varied widely in geographical location, duration, and licorice preparations used. Licorice significantly reduced alanine aminotransferase (ALT) by 15.63 U/L (95% CI: −25.08, −6.18; p = 0.001) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) by 7.37 U/L (95% CI: −13.13, −1.61; p = 0.01) compared to control groups. Subgroup analyses revealed that purified glycyrrhizic acid compounds were particularly effective, showing greater reductions in ALT and AST without significant heterogeneity. Although licorice treatment did not significantly impact gamma-glutamyl transferase and total bilirubin (TBIL) levels overall, specific licorice-herb preparations did show a notable reduction in TBIL. The safety profile of licorice was consistent with known side effects, predominantly mild and related to its mineralocorticoid effects. Despite heterogeneity and potential language bias, the findings suggest that licorice can enhance liver function. Further studies should standardize licorice preparations and explore its role in multifaceted herbal formulations to better understand its hepatoprotective mechanisms."
"Are Small Molecules Effective in Treating Inflammatory Pouch Disorders Following Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis for Ulcerative Colitis? Here Is Where We Stand","Gravina A.G., Pellegrino R., Palladino G., Imperio G., Calabrese F., Pasta A., Giannini E.G., Federico A., Bodini G.","Biomolecules","10.3390/biom14091164","14","9","2024","Ulcerative colitis (UC) management encompasses conventional and advanced treatments, including biological therapy and small molecules. Surgery, particularly in the form of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA), is indicated in cases of refractory/severe disease. IPAA can lead to acute complications (e.g., acute pouchitis) as well as late complications, including chronic inflammatory disorders of the pouch. Chronic pouchitis, including the antibiotic-dependent (CADP) and antibiotic-refractory (CARP) forms, represents a significant and current therapeutic challenge due to the substantial need for evidence regarding viable treatment options. Biological therapies have shown promising results, with infliximab, adalimumab, ustekinumab, and vedolizumab demonstrating some efficacy in chronic pouchitis; however, robust randomized clinical trials are only available for vedolizumab. This narrative review focuses on the evidence concerning small molecules in chronic pouchitis, specifically Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1P-R) modulators. According to the preliminary studies and reports, Tofacitinib shows a potential effectiveness in CARP. Upadacitinib presents variable outcomes from the case series, necessitating further evaluation. Filgotinib and ozanimod demonstrate anecdotal efficacy. This review underscores the need for high-quality studies and real-world registries to develop robust guidelines for advanced therapies in post-IPAA inflammatory disorders, supported by vigilant clinical monitoring and ongoing education from international IBD specialist societies."
"Effect of Liujunzi Decoction on Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta Analysis","Luo W., Lin Z., Liu Y., Tan T., Liu T.","Journal of Herbal Medicine","10.1016/j.hermed.2024.100918","47",NA,"2024","Introduction: Gastroesophageal reflux disease poses a common challenge in digestive health, with some patients experiencing suboptimal responses to conventional Western medicine. Liujunzi decoction (LJZD), a traditional Chinese medicine classic formula, widely employed for gastroesophageal reflux disease in Asia, lacks sufficient evidence-based support for its clinical efficacy. Therefore, this study compared the safety and efficacy of LJZD and proton pump inhibitors for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux using meta analysis. Methods: A comprehensive search of online databases for published clinical trials was carried out up to February 2024. The research selection, gathering of data, quality evaluation, and data analysis techniques were all guided by Cochrane guidelines. Key outcome measures comprised the total clinical response rate (TCE), recurrence rate, frequency scale for the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and gastrointestinal symptom rating scale. Results: Nineteen randomised controlled trials involving 1 941 patients were incorporated into this systematic review and meta analysis. Liujunzi decoction exhibited significantly superior overall efficacy compared to the proton pump inhibitors group, with a higher TCE (OR = 4.04, 95% CI 2.79–5.84, P < 0.001). Treatment with LJZD reduced recurrence rates, and no notable distinctions were observed in frequency scale for the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease and gastrointestinal symptom rating scale.

Conclusions: Liujunzi decoction, whether used alone or in combination with Western medicine, is a safe and effective treatment for Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GRED)."
"Gut microbiota dynamics and association with chronic kidney disease: A longitudinal study within the PREDIMED-Plus trial","Atzeni A., Díaz-López A., Cacho A.H., Babio N., García-Gavilán J.F., Cornejo-Pareja I., Belzer C., Fitó M., Tinahones F.J., Salas-Salvadó J.","Life Sciences","10.1016/j.lfs.2024.122863","351",NA,"2024","Aims: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a global health concern, disproportionately affecting the elderly with heightened cardiovascular risk. The emerging focus on the gut microbiota's role in CKD pathophysiology represents a pivotal area in nephrology; however, the evidence on this topic is limited. This observational prospective study, in the framework of the PREDIMED-Plus trial, investigates associations between gut microbiota composition and the 1-year trajectory of CKD in 343 participants aged 55–75 years with high cardiovascular risk. Materials and methods: Kidney function was assessed at baseline and at 1-year of follow-up through the estimated glomerular filtration rate based on cystatin C (eGFR-CysC) and CKD defined by eGFR-CysC <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Participants were grouped based on their 1-year CKD trajectory: Group 1 maintained normal status or improved from CKD to normal, while Group 2 maintained CKD or worsened from normal to CKD. Fecal microbiota composition was assessed through 16S sequencing. Key findings: We observed differences in gut microbiota composition between CKD trajectory groups. Notably, the baseline relative abundance of Lachnoclostridium and Lachnospira, both butyrate-producing genera, was lower in participants maintaining or progressing to CKD. Longitudinally, a decrease in Lachnospira abundance was associated with CKD progression. The improved Chao1 index after 1-year follow-up suggests a link between enhanced microbial richness and stable/better kidney function. Significance: The findings underscore the potential of gut microbiota analysis in non-invasively monitoring CKD, especially in older populations, and hint at future interventions targeting gut microbiota to manage CKD progression. Further research is needed for causal relationships and generalizability."
"Prophylaxis of hepatic encephalopathy: current and future drug targets","Maharshi S., Sharma B.C.","Hepatology International","10.1007/s12072-024-10647-9","18","4","2024","Hepatic encephalopathy is described by a broad spectrum of neurological and psychiatric aberrations resulting due to advanced liver dysfunction. It is a neurological disorder due to hepatic insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunts. Its clinical presentation includes neuropsychiatric dysfunction ranging from subclinical changes to comatose state. It is a sign of poor prognosis in cirrhotics with a high 1-year mortality. Each episode of hepatic encephalopathy leads to high hospitalization rate, poor prognosis and raised burden of healthcare. Primary prophylaxis is prevention of initial occurrence and secondary prophylaxis is prevention of reappearance of hepatic encephalopathy in subjects who had prior history. Early detection and management of triggers is very important in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. The initial choice of treatment is still lactulose, as it is effective in minimal, overt, and recurrent hepatic encephalopathy. Rifaximin is equally effective as lactulose in managing hepatic encephalopathy and is better tolerated. Branch chain amino acids are beneficial in subjects who are protein intolerant. L-ornithine L-aspartate and probiotics are also useful in the management of hepatic encephalopathy. Rifaximin along with lactulose is effective in managing overt and recurrent hepatic encephalopathy. Large portosystemic shunts embolization and liver transplant is efficacious in certain group of patients. Nutritional therapy and fecal microbiota transplantation are newer therapies for hepatic encephalopathy but the evidences are limited, more research is required to prove their efficacy. Involvement of hospital pharmacists, telemedicine, and providing education are also beneficial in managing hepatic encephalopathy."
"Efficacy of surgical treatments for the management of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome: a network meta-analysis","Gaj F., Lai Q., Gelormini E., Ceci M., Di Saverio S., Quaresima S.","Colorectal Disease","10.1111/codi.17080","26","8","2024","Aim: Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS) is a benign and poorly understood disorder with complex management. Typical symptoms include straining during defaecation, rectal bleeding, tenesmus, mucoid secretion, anal pain and a sense of incomplete evacuation. Diagnosis is based on characteristic clinical symptoms and endoscopic/histological findings. Several treatments have been reported in the literature with variable ulcer healing rates. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different treatments for SRUS. Materials and methods: A systematic review and network meta-analysis were performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Studies in English, French and Spanish languages were included. Papers written in other languages were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were reviews, case reports or clinical series enrolling less than five patients, study duplications, no clinical data of interest and no article available. A systematic literature search was conducted from January 2000 to March 2024 using the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The biases of the studies were assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale or the Jadad scale when appropriate. Types of treatment and their efficacy for the cure of SRUS were collected and critically assessed. The study's primary outcome was to estimate the rate of patients with ulcer healing. Results: A total of 22 studies with 911 patients (men 361, women 550) diagnosed with SRUS were analysed in the final meta-analysis. The pooled effect estimates of treatment efficacy revealed that surgery showed the highest ulcer healing rate (70.5%; 95% CI 0.57–0.83). Surgery was superior in the cure of ulcers with respect to medical therapies and biofeedback (OR 0.09 and OR 0.14). Conclusion: Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is a challenging clinical entity to manage. Proficient results have been reported with the surgical approach, suggesting its positive role in cases refractory to medical and biofeedback therapy. Further studies in homogeneous populations are required to evaluate the efficacy of surgery in this setting. (PROSPERO registration number CRD42022331422)."

Results obtained on animal models suggested that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla are more resistant to bile acids in rats. As part of a pilot study investigating the role of probiotics supplementation in elderly people with home enteral nutrition (HEN), a case of a 92-year-old woman with HEN is reported in the present study. She lives in a nursing home and suffers from Alzheimer’s disease (AD); the patient had been prescribed TUDCA for lithiasis cholangitis. The aim of this case report is therefore to investigate whether long-term TUDCA administration may play a role in altering the patient’s gut microbiota (GM) and the impact of an antibiotic therapy on the diversity of microbial species. Using next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene a dominant shift toward Firmicutes and a remodeling in Proteobacteria abundance was observed in the woman’s gut microbiota. Considering the patient’s age, health status and type of diet, we would have expected to find a GM with a prevalence of Bacteroidetes phylum. This represents the first study investigating the possible TUDCA’s effect on human GM."
"Treatment strategy for older patients with pneumonia independent of the risk of drug resistance in the world's top country for longevity","Komiya K., Yamatani I., Kadota J.-I.","Respiratory Investigation","10.1016/j.resinv.2024.05.016","62","4","2024","The number of older people with impaired swallowing function increases with aging population. Aspiration pneumonia is one of the most cases of pneumonia developing among older people. As aspiration pneumonia may develop as a result of age-related deterioration, it is crucial to consider it as an unavoidable event with aging. While pneumonia is diagnosed based on respiratory symptoms and radiological features, the lung involvement of aspiration pneumonia may be undetectable via a frontal chest radiograph in some cases. Bacterial profiles show the predominance of drug-resistant bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), but isolated bacteria from respiratory samples do not necessarily indicate causative pathogens. Furthermore, there is no evidence regarding treatment superiority using broad-spectrum antibiotics compared with narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Even if isolated pathogens are a causative factor for pneumonia among older patients, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics covering the bacteria may not improve their outcomes. Therefore, we propose a treatment strategy independent of the risk of drug resistance focusing on the discrimination of patients who are unlikely to respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics. An aspiration risk is associated with increased in-hospital mortality in patients with pneumonia, which could also lead to a greater risk of poor long-term outcomes with increased 1-year mortality. Advance care planning is now recognized as a process for communication and medical decision-making across the life course. This approach would be widely recommended for older people with aspiration risk."

We measured Escherichia coli levels in 3909 drinking water samples, 2691 child hand rinses, and 2422 toy ball rinses collected from households enrolled in a 2-year cluster-randomized controlled trial evaluating single and combined WSH interventions. Water treatment with chlorine reduced E. coli in drinking water. A combined WSH intervention improved water quality by the same magnitude but did not affect E. coli levels on hands or toys. One potential explanation for the limited impact of the sanitation intervention (upgraded latrines) is failure to address dog and livestock fecal contamination. Small ruminant (goat or sheep) ownership was associated with increased E. coli levels in stored water and on child hands. Cattle and poultry ownership was protective against child stunting, and domesticated animal ownership was not associated with child diarrhea. Our findings do not support restricting household animal ownership to prevent child diarrheal disease or stunting but do support calls for WSH infrastructure that can more effectively reduce household fecal contamination."

However, intraoperative identification of proper perfusion remains a challeng. This review synthesizes findings from the literature spanning from January 2010 to March 2024, sourced from Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, and other databases, to evaluate the role of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging in enhancing surgical outcomes. Specifically, it explores the use of ICG in surgeries related to Hirschsprung disease, anorectal malformations, cloacal reconstructions, vaginal agenesis, bladder augmentation, and the construction of antegrade continence channels. Preliminary evidence suggests that ICG fluorescence significantly aids in intraoperative decision-making by improving the visualization of vascular networks and assessing tissue perfusion. Despite the limited number of studies, initial findings indicate that ICG may offer advantages over traditional clinical assessments for intestinal perfusion. Its application has demonstrated a promising safety profile in pediatric patients, underscoring the need for larger, prospective studies to validate these observations, quantify benefits, and further assess its impact on clinical outcomes. The potential of ICG to enhance pediatric colorectal surgery by providing real-time, accurate perfusion data could significantly improve surgical precision and patient recovery."

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the proportions of individuals infected with Campylobacter, Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella, or Yersinia who develop reactive arthritis. Methods. A systematic review was conducted, encompassing English-language articles published before January 2024, sourced from the Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. This review included observational studies that reported the occurrence of reactive arthritis (ReA) among patients with Campylobacter, Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella, or Yersinia infections. Data extraction was carried out independently by two reviewers. Subsequently, a random-effects meta-analysis was performed, with heterogeneity assessed using the I(2) value. Additionally, meta-regression was employed to investigate the potential influence of study-level variables on the observed heterogeneity. Results. A total of 87 studies were identified; 23 reported on ReA development after Campylobacter infection, 7 reported on ReA after Escherichia infection, 30 reported ReA onset after salmonellosis, 14 reported ReA after shigellosis, and 13 reported ReA after Yersinia infection. The proportion of Campylobacter patients who developed ReA was 0.03 (95% CI [0.01, 0.06], I(2) = 97.62%); the proportion of Escherichia patients who developed ReA was 0.01 (95% CI [0.00, 0.06], I(2) = 92.78%); the proportion of Salmonella patients was 0.04 (95% CI [0.02, 0.08], I(2) = 97.67%); the proportion of Shigella patients was 0.01 (95% CI [0.01, 0.03], I(2) = 90.64%); and the proportion of Yersinia patients who developed ReA was 0.05 (95% CI [0.02, 0.13], I(2) = 96%). Conclusion. A significant proportion of Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia cases resulted in ReA. Nonetheless, it is important to interpret the findings cautiously due to the substantial heterogeneity observed between studies."

It has been hypothesised that poor 'Western-style' dietary patterns select for a microbiota that drives IBD inflammation and, that through dietary intervention, a healthy microbiota may be restored. This study aimed to systematically review the literature and assess current available evidence regarding the influence of diet on the intestinal microbiota composition in IBD patients, and how this may affect disease activity. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from January 2013 to June 2023, to identify studies investigating diet and microbiota in IBD. Results: Thirteen primary studies met the inclusion criteria and were selected for narrative synthesis. Reported associations between diet and microbiota in IBD were conflicting due to the considerable degree of heterogeneity between studies. Nine intervention studies trialled specific diets and did not demonstrate significant shifts in the diversity and abundance of intestinal microbial communities or improvement in disease outcomes. The remaining four cross-sectional studies did not find a specific microbial signature associated with habitual dietary patterns in IBD patients. Conclusions: Diet modulates the gut microbiota, and this may have implications for IBD; however, the body of evidence does not currently support clear dietary patterns or food constituents that are associated with a specific microbiota profile or disease marker in IBD patients. Further research is required with a focus on robust and consistent methodology to achieve improved identification of associations."

Methods: We searched the following databases: PUBMED, Web of Science, OVID, and SCOPUS from inception to January 15. Inclusion criteria were any phase 2 and 3 clinical trials that compared etrolizumab with a placebo in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, excluding case reports, animal studies, phase 1 trials, and conference abstracts due to duplication. We used RevMan software (5.4) for the meta-analysis. Results: Five clinical trials were included in our meta-analysis. The total number of patients included in the study is 1248 patients, 860 patients in the etrolizumab group and 388 patients in the placebo group. In the induction phase, the pooled analyses showed a statistically significant association between etrolizumab and increased clinical remission, and endoscopic remission compared with placebo (risk ratio [RR] = 2.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.69–4.19, p < 0.0001), and (RR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.52–3.65, p = 0.0001), respectively. In the maintenance phase, the pooled analyses showed a statistically significant association between etrolizumab and increased histologic remission and endoscopic remission (RR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.40–2.98, p = 0.0002) and (RR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.29–2.85, p = 0.001), respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed in adverse events between etrolizumab and placebo in the induction and maintenance phases. Conclusion: Our results show that etrolizumab is an effective and safe drug for the induction and maintenance of clinical remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis patients, as proved by histologic and endoscopic findings. Future randomized trials are still needed to compare etrolizumab to the other agents and further establish its value for the practice."

Studies assessing sustainably sourced protein consumption in community dwelling older adults (≥65 years) were included. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using ‘RoB 2.0′ and ‘ROBINS-E’. Narrative synthesis was performed due to heterogeneity of studies. Twelve studies involving 12,166 older adults were included. Nine studies (n = 10,391) assessed habitual dietary intake and had some RoB concerns, whilst three studies (n = 1812), two with low and one with high RoB, conducted plant-based dietary interventions. Increased adherence to sustainably sourced diets was associated with improved gut microbial factors (n = 4640), healthier food group intake (n = 2142), and increased fibre and vegetable protein intake (n = 1078). Sustainably sourced diets positively impacted on gut microbiota and healthier intake of food groups, although effects on inflammatory outcomes and health status were inconclusive.

Antibiotic overuse is well recognized as the leading cause of CDI in high-risk patients, and studies have demonstrated that even short-term antibiotic exposure can cause a large and persistent disturbance to human colonic microbiota. The recovery and sustainability of the gut microbiome after dysbiosis have been associated with fewer CDI recurrences. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) refers to the procedure in which human donor stool is processed and transplanted to a patient with CDI. It has been historically used in patients with pseudomembranous colitis even before the discovery of Clostridioides difficile. More recent research supports the use of FMT as part of the standard therapy of recurrent CDI.

They play an important role in relieving symptoms of many diseases associated with gastrointestinal tract, for example, in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), antibiotic-associated diarrhea, relapsing Clostridium difficile colitis, Helicobacter pylori infections, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this narrative review, the authors aim to evaluate the role of different probiotic formulations in treating gastrointestinal diseases in pediatric population aged 18 years or younger and highlight the main considerations for selecting probiotic formulations for use in this population. Methodology: The authors searched PubMed and Clinicaltrials.gov from inception to 24th July 2022, without any restrictions. Using an iterative process, the authors subsequently added papers through hand-searching citations contained within retrieved articles and relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Results: The effectiveness of single-organism and composite probiotics in treating gastrointestinal disorders in pediatric patients aged 18 or under were analyzed and compared in this study. A total of 39 studies were reviewed and categorized based on positive and negative outcomes, and compared with a placebo, resulting in 25 studies for single-organism and 14 studies for composite probiotics. Gastrointestinal disorders studied included NEC, acute gastroenteritis (AGE), Acute Diarrhea, Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and others. The results show that probiotics are effective in treating various gastrointestinal disorders in children under 18, with single-organism probiotics demonstrating significant positive outcomes in most studies, and composite probiotics showing positive outcomes in all studies analyzed, with a low incidence of negative outcomes for both types. Conclusion: This study concludes that single-organism and composite probiotics are effective complementary therapies for treating gastrointestinal disorders in the pediatric population. Hence, healthcare professionals should consider using probiotics in standard treatment regimens, and educating guardians can enhance the benefits of probiotic therapy. Further research is recommended to identify the optimal strains and dosages for specific conditions and demographics. The integration of probiotics in clinical practice and ongoing research can contribute to reducing the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal disorders in pediatric patients."

The gut microbiota (GM) and its interconnectedness with human health have emerged as a captivating field of research. This review explores the intricate connections between the gut and the liver, aiming to elucidate how alterations in GM, intestinal barrier function, and gut-derived molecules impact the development and progression of PH. A systematic literature search, following PRISMA guidelines, identified 12 original articles that suggest a relationship between GM, the gut–liver axis, and PH. Mechanisms such as dysbiosis, bacterial translocation, altered microbial structure, and inflammation appear to orchestrate this relationship. One notable study highlights the pivotal role of the farnesoid X receptor axis in regulating the interplay between the gut and liver and proposes it as a promising therapeutic target. Fecal transplantation experiments further emphasize the pathogenic significance of the GM in modulating liver maladies, including PH. Recent advancements in metagenomics and metabolomics have expanded our understanding of the GM’s role in human ailments. The review suggests that addressing the unmet need of identifying gut–liver axis-related metabolic and molecular pathways holds potential for elucidating pathogenesis and directing novel therapeutic interventions."

The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the available literature on the effectiveness and safety of ADE in critically ill patients, with a focus on special conditions such as anti-fungal therapy and high-risk categories. Although it is widely considered a safe strategy for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS), to date, there has been no assessment of the effect of de-escalation on the development of resistance. Conversely, some authors suggest that prolonged antibiotic treatment may be a side effect of de-escalation, especially in high-risk categories such as neutropenic critically ill patients and intra-abdominal infections (IAIs). Moreover, microbiological documentation is crucial for increasing ADE rates in critically ill patients with infections, and efforts should be focused on exploring new diagnostic tools to accelerate pathogen identification. For these reasons, ADE can be safely used in patients with infections, as confirmed by high-quality and reliable microbiological samplings, although further studies are warranted to clarify its applicability in selected populations."

Methods: In 2 cross-sectional cohorts of children with FAPDs (n = 209) and healthy control individuals (n = 105), we correlated dietary fiber intake with abdominal pain symptoms after stratifying by sex. We also performed sex-stratified and sex-interaction analyses on data from a double-blind trial in children with irritable bowel syndrome randomized to psyllium fiber (n = 39) or placebo (n = 49) for 6 weeks. Shotgun metagenomics was used to investigate gut microbiome community changes potentially linking dietary fiber intake with abdominal pain. Results: In the cross-sectional cohorts, fiber intake inversely correlated with pain symptoms in boys (pain episodes: r = –0.24, P = .005; pain days: r = –0.24, P = 0.004) but not in girls. Similarly, in the randomized trial, psyllium fiber reduced the number of pain episodes in boys (P = .012) but not in girls. Generalized linear regression models confirmed that boys treated with psyllium fiber had greater reduction in pain episodes than girls (P = .007 for fiber × sex × time interaction). Age, sexual development, irritable bowel syndrome subtype, stool form, and microbiome composition were not significant determinants in the dietary fiber effects on pain reduction. Conclusions: Dietary fiber preferentially reduces abdominal pain frequency in boys, highlighting the importance of considering sex in future dietary intervention studies for FAPDs.

"The effect of microbiome therapy on COVID-19-induced gut dysbiosis: A narrative and systematic review","Yousef M., Rob M., Varghese S., Rao S., Zamir F., Paul P., Chaari A.","Life Sciences","10.1016/j.lfs.2024.122535","342",NA,"2024","Aims: Emerging evidence highlights the role of COVID-19 in instigating gut dysbiosis, with repercussions on disease severity and bidirectional gut-organ communication involving the lung, heart, brain, and liver. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in addressing gut dysbiosis associated with COVID-19, as well as their impact on related disease severity and clinical outcomes. Materials and methods: We systematically review 27 studies exploring the efficacy of different microbiome-modulating therapies: probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation as potential interventions for COVID-19. Key findings: The probiotics and synbiotics investigated encompassed a spectrum of eight bacterial and fungal genera, namely Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Pediococcus, Bacillus, Saccharomyces, and Kluyveromyces. Noteworthy prebiotics employed in these studies included chestnut tannin, galactooligosaccharides, fructooligosaccharides, xylooligosaccharide, and resistant dextrin. The majority of the investigated biotics exhibited positive effects on COVID-19 patients, manifesting in symptom alleviation, inflammation reduction, and notable decreases in mortality rates. Five studies reported death rates, showing an average mortality ranging from 0 % to 11 % in the intervention groups, as compared to 3 % to 30 % in the control groups. Specifically, probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics demonstrated efficacy in diminishing the duration and severity of symptoms while significantly accelerating viral and symptomatic remission. FMT emerged as a particularly effective strategy, successfully restoring gut microbiota and ameliorating gastrointestinal disorders. Significance: The insights gleaned from this review significantly contribute to our broader comprehension of the therapeutic potential of biotics in addressing COVID-19-related gut dysbiosis and mitigating secondary multi-organ complications."

Prebiotics are a category of food ingredients theorised to have health benefits for the gastrointestinal system through their effect on the growth and activity of intestinal bacteria and probiotics. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of prebiotics for the induction and maintenance of remission in people with active UC. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP on 24 June 2023. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on people with UC. We considered any type of standalone or combination prebiotic intervention, except those prebiotics combined with probiotics (known as synbiotics), compared to any control intervention. We considered interventions of any dose and duration. Data collection and analysis: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. Main results: We included 9 RCTs involving a total of 445 participants. Study duration ranged from 14 days to 2 to 3 months for induction and 1 to 6 months for maintenance of remission. All studies were on adults. Five studies were on people with mild to moderate active disease, three in remission or mild activity, and one did not mention. We judged only one study as at low risk of bias in all areas. Two studies compared prebiotics with placebo for induction of remission. We cannot draw any conclusions about clinical remission (70% versus 67%; risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.94); clinical improvement (mean Rachmilewitz score on day 14 of 4.1 versus 4.5; mean difference (MD) −0.40, 95% CI −2.67 to 1.87); faecal calprotectin levels (mean faecal calprotectin on day 14 of 1211 μg/mL versus 3740 μg/mL; MD −2529.00, 95% CI −6925.38 to 1867.38); interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels (mean IL-8 on day 7 of 2.9 pg/mL versus 5.0 pg/mL; MD −2.10, 95% CI −4.93 to 0.73); prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2) levels (mean PGE-2 on day 7 of 7.1 ng/mL versus 11.5 ng/mL; MD −4.40, 95% CI −20.25 to 11.45); or withdrawals due to adverse events (21% versus 8%; RR 2.73, 95% CI 0.51 to 14.55). All evidence was of very low certainty. No other outcomes were reported. Two studies compared inulin and oligofructose 15 g with inulin and oligofructose 7.5 g for induction of remission. We cannot draw any conclusions about clinical remission (53% versus 12.5%; RR 4.27, 95% CI 1.07 to 16.96); clinical improvement (67% versus 25%; RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.06 to 6.70); total adverse events (53.5% versus 31%; RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.72 to 4.06); or withdrawals due to adverse events (13% versus 25%; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.50). All evidence was of very low certainty. No other outcomes were reported. One study compared prebiotics and anti-inflammatory therapy with anti-inflammatory therapy alone for induction of remission. We cannot draw any conclusions about clinical improvement (mean Lichtiger score at 4 weeks of 6.2 versus 10.3; MD −4.10, 95% CI −8.14 to −0.06) or serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (mean CRP levels at 4 weeks 0.55 ng/mL versus 0.50 ng/mL; MD 0.05, 95% CI −0.37 to 0.47). All evidence was of very low certainty. No other outcomes were reported. Three studies compared prebiotics with placebo for maintenance of remission. There may be no difference between groups in rate of clinical relapse (44% versus 33%; RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.31), and prebiotics may lead to more total adverse events than placebo (77% versus 46%; RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.40). The evidence was of low certainty. We cannot draw any conclusions about clinical improvement (mean partial Mayo score at day 60 of 0.428 versus 1.625; MD −1.20, 95% CI −2.17 to −0.22); faecal calprotectin levels (mean faecal calprotectin level at day 60 of 214 μg/mL versus 304 μg/mL; MD −89.79, 95% CI −221.30 to 41.72); quality of life (mean Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score at day 60 of 193.5 versus 188.0; MD 5.50, 95% CI −8.94 to 19.94); or withdrawals due to adverse events (28.5% versus 11%; RR 2.57, 95% CI 1.15 to 5.73). The evidence for these outcomes was of very low certainty. No other outcomes were reported. One study compared prebiotics with synbiotics for maintenance of remission. We cannot draw any conclusions about quality of life (mean IBDQ score at 4 weeks 182.4 versus 176.1; MD 6.30, 95% CI −6.61 to 19.21) or withdrawals due to adverse events (23% versus 20%; RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.62). All evidence was of very low certainty. No other outcomes were reported. One study compared prebiotics with probiotics for maintenance of remission. We cannot draw any conclusions about quality of life (mean IBDQ score at 4 weeks 182.4 versus 168.6; MD 13.60, 95% CI 1.22 to 25.98) or withdrawals due to adverse events (22.5% versus 22.5%; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.26). All evidence was of very low certainty. No other outcomes were reported. Authors' conclusions: There may be no difference in occurrence of clinical relapse when adjuvant treatment with prebiotics is compared with adjuvant treatment with placebo for maintenance of remission in UC. Adjuvant treatment with prebiotics may result in more total adverse events when compared to adjuvant treatment with placebo for maintenance of remission. We could draw no conclusions for any of the other outcomes in this comparison due to the very low certainty of the evidence. The evidence for all other comparisons and outcomes was also of very low certainty, precluding any conclusions. It is difficult to make any clear recommendations for future research based on the findings of this review given the clinical and methodological heterogeneity among studies. It is recommended that a consensus is reached on these issues prior to any further research."
"Antibiotic prophylaxis for leptospirosis","Win T.Z., Perinpanathan T., Mukadi P., Smith C., Edwards T., Han S.M., Maung H.T., Brett-Major D.M., Lee N.","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","10.1002/14651858.CD014959.pub2","2024","3","2024","Background: Leptospirosis is a global zoonotic and waterborne disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. Antibiotics are used as a strategy for prevention of leptospirosis, in particular in travellers and high-risk groups. However, the clinical benefits are unknown, especially when considering possible treatment-associated adverse effects. This review assesses the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in leptospirosis and is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Library (2009, Issue 3). Objectives: To evaluate the benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis for human leptospirosis. Search methods: We identified randomised clinical trials through electronic searches of the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and other resources. We searched online clinical trial registries to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. We checked reference lists of the retrieved studies for further trials. The last date of search was 17 April 2023. Selection criteria: We included ⁠⁠randomised clinical trials of any trial design, assessing antibiotics for prevention of leptospirosis, and with no restrictions on age, sex, occupation, or comorbidity of trial participants. We looked for trials assessing antibiotics irrespective of route of administration, dosage, and schedule versus placebo or no intervention. We also included trials assessing antibiotics versus other antibiotics using these criteria, or the same antibiotic but with another dose or schedule. Data collection and analysis: We followed Cochrane methodology. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis regardless of the presence of an identified clinical syndrome (inclusive of asymptomatic cases), clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis regardless of the presence of laboratory confirmation, clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis confirmed by laboratory diagnosis (exclusive of asymptomatic cases), and serious adverse events. The secondary outcomes were quality of life and the proportion of people with non-serious adverse events. We assessed the risk of bias of the included trials using the RoB 2 tool and the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We presented dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD), with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a random-effects model for our main analyses and the fixed-effect model for sensitivity analyses. Our primary outcome analyses included trial data at the longest follow-up. Main results: We identified five randomised clinical trials comprising 2593 participants that compared antibiotics (doxycycline, azithromycin, or penicillin) with placebo, or one antibiotic compared with another. Four trials assessed doxycycline with different durations, one trial assessed azithromycin, and one trial assessed penicillin. One trial had three intervention groups: doxycycline, azithromycin, and placebo. Three trials assessed pre-exposure prophylaxis, one trial assessed postexposure prophylaxis, and one did not report this clearly. Four trials recruited residents in endemic areas, and one trial recruited soldiers who experienced limited time exposure. The participants' ages in the included trials were 10 to 80 years. Follow-up ranged from one to three months. Antibiotics versus placebo. Doxycycline compared with placebo may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.83; 1 trial, 782 participants; low-certainty evidence). Prophylactic antibiotics may have little to no effect on laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.26; 5 trials, 2593 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Antibiotics may result in little to no difference in the clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis regardless of laboratory confirmation (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.08; 4 trials, 1653 participants; low-certainty evidence) and the clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis with laboratory confirmation (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.26; 4 trials, 1653 participants; low-certainty evidence). Antibiotics compared with placebo may increase non-serious adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 10.13, 95% CI 2.40 to 42.71; 3 trials, 1909 participants; very low-certainty evidence). One antibiotic versus another antibiotic. One trial assessed doxycycline versus azithromycin but did not report mortality. Compared to azithromycin, doxycycline may have little to no effect on laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis regardless of the presence of an identified clinical syndrome (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.32; 1 trial, 137 participants), on the clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis regardless of the presence of laboratory confirmation (RR 4.18, 95% CI 0.94 to 18.66; 1 trial, 137 participants), on the clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis confirmed by laboratory diagnosis (RR 4.18, 95% CI 0.94 to 18.66; 1 trial, 137 participants), and on non-serious adverse events (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.48; 1 trial, 137 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain. The certainty of evidence for all the outcomes was very low. None of the five included trials reported serious adverse events or assessed quality of life. One study is awaiting classification. Funding. Four of the five trials included statements disclosing their funding/supporting sources, and the remaining trial did not include this. Three of the four trials that disclosed their supporting sources received the supply of trial drugs directly from the same pharmaceutical company, and the remaining trial received financial support from a governmental source. Authors' conclusions: We do not know if antibiotics versus placebo or another antibiotic has little or have no effect on all-cause mortality or leptospirosis infection because the certainty of evidence is low or very low. We do not know if antibiotics versus placebo may increase the overall risk of non-serious adverse events because of very low-certainty evidence. We lack definitive rigorous data from randomised trials to support the use of antibiotics for the prophylaxis of leptospirosis infection. We lack trials reporting data on clinically relevant outcomes."
"Chinese herbal medicine for irinotecan-induced diarrhea: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Lin X., Fang Y., Cheng Y., Wang Q.","Explore","10.1016/j.explore.2023.08.003","20","2","2024","Introduction: Irinotecan is a novel first-line therapy for colorectal cancer, but the toxicity and side effects include diarrhea without satisfactory treatments. Chinese herbal decoction (CHD) is an effective complementary and alternative prevention and therapy for irinotecan induced diarrhea (IID). This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aims to assess the preventive effect of CHD in the treatment of IID. Methods: Seven databases (PubMed, COCHRANE, EMBASE, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, and CBM) were screened for random controlled trials on the prevention and treatment of IID by CHD from January 1980 to May 2022. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias (ROB 2.0) was applied for bias risk assessment, and the Grading Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) for quality of evidence. Meta-analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.3 software. In addition, a subgroup analysis was conducted on different grades of diarrhea, the incidence and duration of diarrhea, the selection of specific Chinese herbal medicine decoction, and the incidence of adverse reactions. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for all data by combining the meta-analysis with fixed or random-effects models based on outcome heterogeneity. Results: Fourteen RCTs involving 1056 participants were included. The study results displayed that the incidence of IID was lower with the use of CHD than the no-treatment group (RR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.40–0.75, P = 0.0002). CHD in combination with western medicine (WM) was more effective than WM alone for IID (RR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.23–0.84, P = 0.01). This protective effect was more pronounced for severe grade III–V diarrhea (RR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.26–0.64, P < 0.0001). In the specific Chinese herbal medicine decoction, the Banxia Xie Xin decoction presented better effectiveness (RR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05–0.63, P = 0.007) than WM alone. The Huangqin decoction was the most widely studied interventional scheme (n = 5). The relative risk (RR) of the Huangqin decoction was 0.56. No obvious adverse reactions were observed. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that CHD has a preventive effect on IID and could be used as a complementary therapy with few side effects. However, additional large-sample, high-quality, randomized, double-blind trials are needed to guide the clinical practice scientifically.

"Hemochromatosis: Ferroptosis, ROS, Gut Microbiome, and Clinical Challenges with Alcohol as Confounding Variable","Teschke R.","International Journal of Molecular Sciences","10.3390/ijms25052668","25","5","2024","Hemochromatosis represents clinically one of the most important genetic storage diseases of the liver caused by iron overload, which is to be differentiated from hepatic iron overload due to excessive iron release from erythrocytes in patients with genetic hemolytic disorders. This disorder is under recent mechanistic discussion regarding ferroptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), the gut microbiome, and alcohol abuse as a risk factor, which are all topics of this review article. Triggered by released intracellular free iron from ferritin via the autophagic process of ferritinophagy, ferroptosis is involved in hemochromatosis as a specific form of iron-dependent regulated cell death. This develops in the course of mitochondrial injury associated with additional iron accumulation, followed by excessive production of ROS and lipid peroxidation. A low fecal iron content during therapeutic iron depletion reduces colonic inflammation and oxidative stress. In clinical terms, iron is an essential trace element required for human health. Humans cannot synthesize iron and must take it up from iron-containing foods and beverages. Under physiological conditions, healthy individuals allow for iron homeostasis by restricting the extent of intestinal iron depending on realistic demand, avoiding uptake of iron in excess. For this condition, the human body has no chance to adequately compensate through removal. In patients with hemochromatosis, the molecular finetuning of intestinal iron uptake is set off due to mutations in the high-FE(2+) (HFE) genes that lead to a lack of hepcidin or resistance on the part of ferroportin to hepcidin binding. This is the major mechanism for the increased iron stores in the body. Hepcidin is a liver-derived peptide, which impairs the release of iron from enterocytes and macrophages by interacting with ferroportin. As a result, iron accumulates in various organs including the liver, which is severely injured and causes the clinically important hemochromatosis. This diagnosis is difficult to establish due to uncharacteristic features. Among these are asthenia, joint pain, arthritis, chondrocalcinosis, diabetes mellitus, hypopituitarism, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and cardiopathy. Diagnosis is initially suspected by increased serum levels of ferritin, a non-specific parameter also elevated in inflammatory diseases that must be excluded to be on the safer diagnostic side. Diagnosis is facilitated if ferritin is combined with elevated fasting transferrin saturation, genetic testing, and family screening. Various diagnostic attempts were published as algorithms. However, none of these were based on evidence or quantitative results derived from scored key features as opposed to other known complex diseases. Among these are autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) or drug-induced liver injury (DILI). For both diseases, the scored diagnostic algorithms are used in line with artificial intelligence (AI) principles to ascertain the diagnosis. The first-line therapy of hemochromatosis involves regular and life-long phlebotomy to remove iron from the blood, which improves the prognosis and may prevent the development of end-stage liver disease such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver transplantation is rarely performed, confined to acute liver failure. In conclusion, ferroptosis, ROS, the gut microbiome, and concomitant alcohol abuse play a major contributing role in the development and clinical course of genetic hemochromatosis, which requires early diagnosis and therapy initiation through phlebotomy as a first-line treatment."

Factors such as age, diet, antibiotic administration, and geographic location can affect the gut microbiota. The intra- and inter-individual variability of fecal microbiota in horses complicates its interpretation and has hindered the establishment of a clear definition for dysbiosis. Although a definitive causal relationship between gut dysbiosis in horses and diseases has not been clearly identified, recent research suggests that dysbiosis may play a role in the pathogenesis of various conditions, such as colitis and asthma. Prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation to modulate the horse’s gastrointestinal tract may eventually be considered a valuable tool for preventing or treating diseases, such as antibiotic-induced colitis. This article aims to summarize the current knowledge on the importance of intestinal microbiota in horses and factors influencing its composition, and also to review the published literature on methods for detecting dysbiosis while discussing the efficacy of gut microbiota manipulation in horses."

Coverage of sterile goods may be important to protect the goods from bacterial air contamination while awaiting surgery. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of this practice in a systematic review covering five databases using search terms related to bacterial contamination in the operating room and on surgical instruments. Methods: MEDLINE, Cochrane, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to February 13(th), 2023, for randomized and non-randomized controlled studies of covering interventions conducted in the operating room setting. The outcome was bacterial air contamination measured as colony-forming units, and a meta-analysis was performed in separate time periods of coverage. This systematic review and meta-analysis is reported according to the PRISMA statement, and the protocol was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022323113). The time points ranged from 30 min to 24 h. Findings: The results showed that covering sterile goods significantly prevented bacterial air contamination as compared to uncovered goods. The meta-analysis was in favour of covering sterile goods for protection from bacterial air contamination, and showed an effect size Z of 4.76 (P<0.00001; confidence interval: −1.94 to −0.81). The heterogeneity analysis showed a heterogeneity of 83%. Conclusion: No negative effects regarding bacterial contamination were found, and so we conclude that protection with a sterile cover decreases bacterial air contamination of sterile goods while waiting for surgery to start."

However, different studies have reported conflicting results. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis are necessary to assess the efficacy and safety of SML injection for the treatment of DKD. Methods: We searched 6 electronic literature databases comparing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), SML injection in combination with ACEIs/ARBs that were conducted from inception until September 5, 2023. Two reviewers extracted data and independently assessed the risk of bias. Using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Risk Assessment. Mean differences (MD) were combined with random-effects models and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. Review Manager 5.4 software was used for meta-analysis. Stata 17.0 software was used for sensitivity analysis and Egger test. Results: The combined results show that the use of SML injection along with ACEI/ARB led to better outcomes than the use of controls in terms of enhancing recovery: renal function: Serum creatinine (MD = -14.69, 95% CI (-19.38, -10.00)), Blood urea nitrogen (MD = -1.23, 95% CI (-1.72, -0.74)), Urinary β2-microglobulin (MD = -4.58, 95% CI (-7.72, -1.44)); urinary protein: Urinary albumin excretion rate (MD = -45.74, 95% CI (-58.92, -32.56)), Urine albumin-creatinine ratio (MD = -11.93, 95% CI (-13.89, -9.96)), 24-h urine proteinuria (MD = -0.59, 95% CI (-0.86, -0.32)), Urine microalbumin (MD = -13.50, 95% CI (-20.18, -6.83)). Additionally, adjuvant therapy with SML injection enhanced results in blood glucose, blood pressure, lipids, and inflammatory responses, and no significant variations in adverse events were discovered between the 2 groups. Conclusions: In patients with DKD, combining SML injection with ACEI/ARB improves renal function, renal proteinuria, hyperglycemia, blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and inflammatory response."

Recurrent UTIs (rUTIs) can be particularly problematic and lead to potential hospitalizations, multiple antibiotic courses, and have a potential negative impact on quality of life. To prevent UTIs, antibiotics are frequently used for prophylaxis; however, antibiotic prophylaxis has notable untoward consequences including but not limited to potential adverse effects and development of antibiotic resistance. Methenamine, an antiseptic agent initially available in 1967, has re-emerged as a potential option for UTI prophylaxis in various populations, including older adults and renal transplant recipients. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of methenamine for UTI prophylaxis. A systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidance was performed. A PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library search was conducted to identify relevant English-language studies evaluating methenamine for UTI prophylaxis including randomized controlled trials, case–control studies, and meta-analyses through June 2023. Articles were excluded if the studies did not primarily describe or evaluate methenamine for UTI prophylaxis, were commentaries/viewpoints articles, point prevalence studies, review articles, studies that evaluated methenamine used with another agent, and any duplicate publications from searched databases. A total of 11 articles were identified for inclusion. This systematic review suggests methenamine generally appears to be an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic-sparing option for UTI prophylaxis. Furthermore, the pharmacology, dosage and formulation, warnings, precautions, and safety considerations of methenamine that provide potential clinical considerations regarding its use for UTI prophylaxis are described. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical utility of methenamine for UTI prophylaxis."
"Current perspectives on fecal microbiota transplantation in inflammatory bowel disease","Singh A., Midha V., Chauhan N.S., Sood A.","Indian Journal of Gastroenterology","10.1007/s12664-023-01516-8","43","1","2024","Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality within the domain of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While FMT has secured approval and demonstrated efficacy in addressing recurrent and refractory Clostridioides difficile infection, its application in IBD remains an area of active exploration and research. The current status of FMT in IBD reflects a nuanced landscape, with ongoing investigations delving into its effectiveness, safety and optimal implementation. Early-stage clinical trials and observational studies have provided insights into the potential of FMT to modulate the dysbiotic gut microbiota associated with IBD, aiming to mitigate inflammation and promote mucosal healing. However, considerable complexities persist, including variations in donor selection, treatment protocols and outcome assessments. Challenges in standardizing FMT protocols for IBD treatment are compounded by the dynamic nature of the gut microbiome and the heterogeneity of IBD itself. Despite these challenges, enthusiasm for FMT in IBD emanates from its capacity to address gut microbial dysbiosis, signifying a paradigm shift towards more comprehensive approaches in IBD management. As ongoing research progresses, an enhanced understanding of FMT’s role in IBD therapy is anticipated. This article synthesizes the current status of FMT in IBD, elucidating the attendant challenges and aspiring towards the refinement of its application for improved patient outcomes."
"Antibiotic Therapy for Active Crohn’s Disease Targeting Pathogens: An Overview and Update","Iaquinto G., Mazzarella G., Sellitto C., Lucariello A., Melina R., Iaquinto S., De Luca A., Rotondi Aufiero V.","Antibiotics","10.3390/antibiotics13020151","13","2","2024","Crohn’s disease (CD) is a multifactorial chronic disorder that involves a combination of factors, including genetics, immune response, and gut microbiota. Therapy includes salicylates, immunosuppressive agents, corticosteroids, and biologic drugs. International guidelines do not recommend the use of antibiotics for CD patients, except in the case of septic complications. Increasing evidence of the involvement of gut bacteria in this chronic disease supports the rationale for using antibiotics as the primary treatment for active CD. In recent decades, several pathogens have been reported to be involved in the development of CD, but only Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Mycobacterium avium paratubercolosis (MAP) have aroused interest due to their strong association with CD pathogenesis. Several meta-analyses have been published concerning antibiotic treatment for CD patients, but randomized trials testing antibiotic treatment against E. coli and MAP have not shown prolonged benefits and have generated conflicting results; several questions are still unresolved regarding trial design, antibiotic dosing, the formulation used, the treatment course, and the outcome measures. In this paper, we provide an overview and update of the trials testing antibiotic treatment for active CD patients, taking into account the role of pathogens, the mechanisms by which different antibiotics act on harmful pathogens, and antibiotic resistance. Finally, we also present new lines of study for the future regarding the use of antibiotics to treat patients with active CD."

In 2018, there were 7253 listed cases of FRI in Germany, corresponding to an incidence of 10.7 cases per 100 000 persons per year. Methods: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved from a search in PubMed with the search terms ""fracture,"" ""infection,"" ""guideline,"" and ""consensus."" Aside from the primary literature, international guidelines and consensus recommendations were evaluated as well. Results: FRI arise mainly from bacterial contamination of the fracture site. Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly detected pathogen. The treatment is based on surgery and antibiotics and should be agreed upon by an interdisciplinary team; it is often difficult because of biofilm formation. Treatment options include implant-preserving procedures and single-stage, two-stage, or multi-stage implant replacement. Treatment failure occurs in 10.3% to 21.4% of cases. The available evidence on the efficacy of various treatment approaches is derived mainly from retrospective cohort studies (level III evidence). Therefore, periprosthetic joint infections and FRI are often discussed together. Conclusion: FRI presents an increasing challenge. Preventive measures should be optimized, and the treatment should always be decided upon by an interdisciplinary team. Only low-level evidence is available to date to guide diagnostic and treatment decisions. High-quality studies are therefore needed to help us meet this challenge more effectively."
"Oral killed cholera vaccines for preventing cholera","Saif-Ur-Rahman K.M., Mamun R., Hasan M., Meiring J.E., Khan M.A.","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","10.1002/14651858.CD014573","2024","1","2024","Background: Cholera causes acute watery diarrhoea and death if not properly treated. Outbreaks occur in areas with poor sanitation, including refugee camps. Several vaccines have been developed and tested over the last 50 years. This is an update of a Cochrane review, originally published in 1998, which explored the effects of all vaccines for preventing cholera. This review examines oral vaccines made from killed bacteria. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of the available World Health Organization (WHO)-prequalified oral killed cholera vaccines among children and adults. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; CENTRAL, MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; and two trials registers (February 2023). Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster-RCTs. There were no restrictions on the age and sex of the participants or the setting of the study. We considered any available WHO-prequalified oral killed cholera vaccine as an intervention. The control group was given a placebo, another vaccine, or no vaccine. The outcomes were related to vaccine effectiveness and safety. We included articles published in English only. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and extracted data from included studies. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane ROB 1 assessment tool. We used the generic inverse variance and a random-effects model meta-analysis to estimate the pooled effect of the interventions. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. For vaccine effectiveness (VE), we converted the overall risk ratio (RR) to vaccine effectiveness using the formula: VE = (1 - RR) x 100%. Main results: Five RCTs, reported in 12 records, with 462,754 participants, met the inclusion criteria. We identified trials on whole-cell plus recombinant vaccine (WC-rBS vaccine (Dukoral)) from Peru and trials on bivalent whole-cell vaccine (BivWC (Shanchol)) vaccine from India and Bangladesh. We did not identify any trials on other BivWC vaccines (Euvichol/Euvichol-Plus), or Hillchol. Two doses of Dukoral with or without a booster dose reduces cases of cholera at two-year follow-up in a general population of children and adults, and at five-month follow-up in an adult male population (overall VE 76%; RR 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.65; 2 trials, 16,423 participants; high-certainty evidence). Two doses of Shanchol reduces cases of cholera at one-year follow-up (overall VE 37%; RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.85; 2 trials, 241,631 participants; high-certainty evidence), at two-year follow-up (overall VE 64%; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.81; 2 trials, 168,540 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and at five-year follow-up (overall VE 80%; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.26; 1 trial, 54,519 participants; high-certainty evidence). A single dose of Shanchol reduces cases of cholera at six-month follow-up (overall VE 40%; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.77; 1 trial, 204,700 participants; high-certainty evidence), and at two-year follow-up (overall VE 39%; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.70; 1 trial, 204,700 participants; high-certainty evidence). A single dose of Shanchol also reduces cases of severe dehydrating cholera at six-month follow-up (overall VE 63%; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.50; 1 trial, 204,700 participants; high-certainty evidence), and at two-year follow-up (overall VE 50%; RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.60; 1 trial, 204,700 participants; high-certainty evidence). We found no differences in the reporting of adverse events due to vaccination between the vaccine and control/placebo groups. Authors' conclusions: Two doses of Dukoral reduces cases of cholera at two-year follow-up. Two doses of Shanchol reduces cases of cholera at five-year follow-up, and a single dose of Shanchol reduces cases of cholera at two-year follow-up. Overall, the vaccines were safe and well-tolerated. We found no trials on other BivWC vaccines (Euvichol/Euvichol-Plus). However, BivWC products (Shanchol, Euvichol/Euvichol-Plus) are considered to produce comparable vibriocidal responses. Therefore, it is reasonable to apply the results from Shanchol trials to the other BivWC products (Euvichol/Euvichol-Plus)."

The connection with the gut microbiome led to oral probiotics as a therapeutic strategy. However, being viable microorganisms, probiotics might present risks. Thus, non-viable postbiotics have been considered as an alternative. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of oral Lactobacillus postbiotics for managing symptoms of AD in pediatric and adult patients. A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Nine randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of non-viable Lactobacillus spp. administered orally to patients diagnosed with AD were included in the review, in which 512 subjects were evaluated after the intervention. Most studies allowed the concomitant usage of corticosteroids. Three studies focused on adults and indicated symptom improvement. In contrast, three out of six trials evaluating pediatric patients did not report postbiotics-favoring results. The dosage seems to be relevant for outcome determination. Two trials compared postbiotics with their viable analogs, and only one reported positive results in both groups. Postbiotics-associated shifts in gut microbial communities were reported in one trial. Mild adverse effects were detected by a single study. The overall results suggested that Lactobacillus postbiotics might be successfully used as adjuvant AD therapy in adults. Thus far, data do not indicate efficacy in pediatric patients. Standardizing nomenclatures and experimental procedures, as well as expanding the studies to more geographic locations and assessing comprehensively the effects on the gut microbiome would provide better perspectives of postbiotics as a therapeutic option for AD."

Historically, two antibiotics (metronidazole and vancomycin) and a recent third (fidaxomicin) have been used for CDI treatment; convincing data are now available showing that metronidazole is the least efficacious agent. The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) management guidance for CDI were updated in 2021. This guidance document outlines the treatment options for a variety of CDI clinical scenarios and for non-antimicrobial management (e.g., faecal microbiota transplantation, FMT). One of the main changes is that metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line CDI treatment. Rather, fidaxomicin is preferred on the basis of reduced recurrence rates with vancomycin as an acceptable alternative. Recommended options for recurrent CDI now include bezlotoxumab as well as FMT. A 2017 survey of 20 European countries highlighted variation internationally in CDI management strategies. A variety of restrictions were in place in 65% countries prior to use of new anti-CDI treatments, including committee/infection specialist approval or economic review/restrictions. This survey was repeated in November 2022 to assess the current landscape of CDI management practices in Europe. Of 64 respondents from 17 countries, national CDI guidelines existed in 14 countries, and 11 have already/plan to incorporate the ESCMID 2021 CDI guidance, though implementation has not been surveyed in 6. Vancomycin is the most commonly used first-line agent for the treatment of CDI (n = 42, 66%), followed by fidaxomicin (n = 30, 47%). Six (9%) respondents use metronidazole as first-line agent for CDI treatment, whereas 22 (34%) only in selected low-risk patient groups. Fidaxomicin is more likely to be used in high-risk patient groups. Availability of anti-CDI therapy influenced prescribing in six respondents (9%). Approval pre-prescription was required before vancomycin (n = 3, 5%), fidaxomicin (n = 10, 6%), bezlotoxumab (n = 11, 17%) and FMT (n = 10, 6%). Implementation of CDI guidelines is rarely audited. Novel anti-CDI agents are being evaluated; it is not yet clear what will be the roles of these agents. The treatment of recurrent CDI is particularly troublesome, and several different live biotherapeutics are being developed, in addition to FMT."

A critical role also exists for the gut microbiota, a complex polymicrobial ecology at the interface of the internal and external environment. The gut microbiota contributes to food digestion and transformation, caloric intake, and immune response of the host, keeping the homeostatic control in health. Mechanisms of disease include enhanced energy extraction from the non-digestible dietary carbohydrates, increased gut permeability and translocation of bacterial metabolites which activate a chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and insulin resistance, as precursors of tangible metabolic disorders involving glucose and lipid homeostasis. The ultimate causative role of gut microbiota in this respect remains to be elucidated, as well as the therapeutic value of manipulating the gut microbiota by diet, pre- and pro- synbiotics, or fecal microbial transplantation"

This is an invasive procedure that could lead to short bowel syndrome. In the 21st century, several new enteroscopy techniques were distributed worldwide, including DBE, single-balloon enteroscopy, spiral enteroscopy, and motorized spiral enteroscopy. These devices enable the diagnoses and endoscopic interventions in the entire small bowel, even in patients with a history of laparotomy. In patients with Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (PJS), endoscopic ischemic polypectomy with clips or a detachable snare is the preferred method for managing pedunculated polyps because it is less likely to cause adverse events than conventional polypectomy. Although polyps in patients with PJS always recur, repeat endoscopic resection can reduce the total number and mean size of polyps in the long-term clinical course. Endoscopic reduction of small-bowel intussusception caused by PJS polyps can be successfully performed using DBE without surgery. A transparent hood is useful for securing a visual field during the treatment of small-bowel polyps, and minimal water exchange method is recommended to facilitate deep insertion. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer. Because jejunal and ileal polyps in patients with FAP have the potential to develop into cancer via the adenoma–carcinoma sequence, periodical surveillance, and endoscopic resection are needed for them, not only polyps in the duodenum. In cases of multiple small-bowel polyps in patients with FAP, cold snare polypectomy without retrieval is an acceptable treatment option for polyps that are 10 mm or smaller in size. Additional good pieces of evidence are necessary to confirm these findings because this narrative review mostly includes retrospective observational studies from single center, case reports, and expert reviews."

A large cohort with high-quality clinical data and clearly defined biomarkers or endpoints are required to draw meaningful conclusions. This systematic review compiles every clinical trial conducted using a defined dose of resveratrol in a purified form across multiple morbidities to highlight the current ‘state-of-play’ and knowledge gaps, informing future trial designs to facilitate the realisation of resveratrol’s potential benefits to human health. Over the last 20 years, there have been almost 200 studies evaluating resveratrol across at least 24 indications, including cancer, menopause symptoms, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. There are currently no consensus treatment regimens for any given condition or endpoint, beyond the fact that resveratrol is generally well-tolerated at a dose of up to 1 g/day. Additionally, resveratrol consistently reduces inflammatory markers and improves aspects of a dysregulated metabolism. In conclusion, over the last 20 years, the increasing weight of clinical evidence suggests resveratrol can benefit human health, but more large, high-quality clinical trials are required to transition this intriguing compound from health food shops to the clinic."

In this review of published literature, we report the available information on efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of FDA approved ADCs for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors in the geriatric population. We explore the results of clinical trials dedicated for older individuals as well as subgroup analyses of the geriatric population in major trials evaluating these drugs. Available data suggest a similar efficacy in older adults as compared to general population. However, older patients might be prone to a higher rate of adverse events in incidence with a potential impact on quality of life. We lack data to support primary dose reductions or schedule modifications in this category of patients. No pharmacokinetic differences were reported between age groups. It is crucial to encourage the development of clinical trials dedicated to older patients with geriatric parameters (G8 score, G-CODE…) so that results can be more representative of this population outside of clinical trials."

The Gut microbiota (GM) produce neuroactives, specifically neurotransmitters that modulates local and central neuronal brain functions. An imbalance between intestinal commensals and pathobionts leads to a disruption in the gut microbiota or dysbiosis, which affects intestinal barrier integrity and gut-immune and neuroimmune systems. Currently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is recommended for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. FMT elicits its action by ameliorating inflammatory responses through the restoration of microbial composition and functionality. Thus, FMT may be a potential therapeutic option in suppressing neuroinflammation in post-stroke conditions and other neurological disorders involving the neuroimmune axis. Specifically, FMT protects against ischemic injury by decreasing IL-17, IFN-γ, Bax, and increasing Bcl-2 expression. Interestingly, FMT improves cognitive function by lowering amyloid-β accumulation and upregulating synaptic marker (PSD-95, synapsin-1) expression in Alzheimer’s disease. In Parkinson’s disease, FMT was shown to inhibit the expression of TLR4 and NF-κB. In this review article, we have summarized the potential sources and methods of administration of FMT and its impact on neuroimmune and cognitive functions. We also provide a comprehensive update on the beneficial effects of FMT in various neurological disorders by undertaking a detailed interrogation of the preclinical and clinical published literature."

Butyrate is an important metabolite of intestinal microorganisms. Recent studies have shown that butyrate has a significant protective effect in animal models of cerebral ischaemic injury. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of butyrate on cerebral ischaemic stroke by meta-analysis, aiming to provide a scientific basis for the clinical application of butyrate in patients with cerebral ischaemia. Materials and methods: A systematic search was conducted for all relevant studies published before 23 January 2024, in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Methodological quality was assessed using Syrcle’s risk of bias tool for animal studies. Data were analysed using Rev Man 5.3 software. Results: A total of nine studies were included, and compared with controls, butyrate significantly increased BDNF levels in the brain (SMD = 2.33, 95%CI = [1.20, 3.47], p < 0.005) and P-Akt expression (SMD = 3.53, 95% CI = [0.97, 6.10], p < 0.05). Butyrate also decreased IL-β levels in the brain (SMD = −2.02, 95% CI = [−3.22, −0.81], p < 0.005), TNF-α levels (SMD = −0.86, 95% CI = [−1.60, −0.12], p < 0.05), and peripheral vascular IL-1β levels (SMD = −2.10, 95%CI = [−3.59, −0.61], p < 0.05). In addition, butyrate reduced cerebral infarct volume (MD = −11.29, 95%CI = [−17.03, −5.54], p < 0.05), mNSS score (MD = −2.86, 95%CI = [−4.12, −1.60], p < 0.005), foot fault score (MD = −7.59, 95%CI = [−9.83, −5, 35], p < 0.005), and Morris water maze time (SMD = −2.49, 95%CI = [−4.42, −0.55], p < 0.05). Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that butyrate has a protective effect on cerebral ischaemic stroke in animal models, and the mechanism is related to reducing inflammation and inhibiting apoptosis.

This review article provides update in treatment and management of microscopic colitis and immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis (ICPi colitis). Recent findings Recent studies on microscopic colitis have focused on the successful use of immunomodulators such as biologics for treatment of budesonide refractory microscopic colitis cases. Microscopic colitis does not confer an added risk for colorectal cancer. With the increasing usage of immunotherapy agents, immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis is becoming more common. ICPi colitis can be successfully managed with steroids, with treatment stepped up to biologics for moderate to severe cases or for mild cases that do not respond to steroids. Immunotherapy agents can be carefully re-introduced in mild cases, after treatment of ICPi colitis. Summary Biologics can be used to treat budesonide refractory microscopic colitis. ICPi colitis can be managed with steroids and biologics in moderate to severe cases."

Polyphenols are the most commonly used sources of curcumin. It combats oxidative stress and inflammation in diseases, such as hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, arthritis, and depression. Most of these benefits are due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Curcumin consumption leads to decreased bioavailability, resulting in limited absorption, quick metabolism, and quick excretion, which hinders health improvement. Numerous factors can increase its bioavailability. Piperine enhances bioavailability when combined with curcumin in a complex. When combined with other enhancing agents, curcumin has a wide spectrum of health benefits. This review evaluates the therapeutic potential of curcumin with a specific emphasis on its approach based on molecular signaling pathways. This study investigated its influence on the progression of cancer, inflammation, and many health-related mechanisms, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis.

"Treat to target in Crohn’s disease: A practical guide for clinicians","Srinivasan A.R.","World Journal of Gastroenterology","10.3748/wjg.v30.i1.50","30","1","2024","A treat-to-target (T2T) approach applies the principles of early intervention and tight disease control to optimise long-term outcomes in Crohn's disease. The Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE)-II guidelines specify short, intermediate, and long-term treatment goals, documenting specific treatment targets to be achieved at each of these timepoints. Scheduled appraisal of Crohn’s disease activity against pre-defined treatment targets at these timepoints remains central to determining whether current therapy should be continued or modified. Consensus treatment targets in Crohn’s disease comprise combination clinical and patient-reported outcome remission, in conjunction with biomarker normalisation and endoscopic healing. Although the STRIDE-II guidelines endorse the pursuit of endoscopic healing, clinicians must consider that this may not always be appropriate, acceptable, or achievable in all patients. This underscores the need to engage patients at the outset in an effort to personalise care and individualise treatment targets. The use of non-invasive biomarkers such as faecal calprotectin in conjunction with cross-sectional imaging techniques, particularly intestinal ultrasound, holds great promise; as do emerging treatment targets such as transmural healing. Two randomised clinical trials, namely, CALM and STARDUST, have evaluated the efficacy of a T2T approach in achieving endoscopic endpoints in patients with Crohn’s disease. Findings from these studies reflect that patient subgroups and Crohn’s disease characteristics likely to benefit most from a T2T approach, remain to be clarified. Moreover, outside of clinical trials, data pertaining to the real-world effectiveness of a T2T approach remains scare, highlighting the need for pragmatic real-world studies. Despite the obvious promise of a T2T approach, a lack of guidance to support its integration into real-world clinical practice has the potential to limit its uptake. This highlights the need to describe strategies, processes, and models of care capable of supporting the integration and execution of a T2T approach in real-world clinical practice. Hence, this review seeks to examine the current and emerging literature to provide clinicians with practical guidance on how to incorporate the principles of T2T into routine clinical practice for the management of Crohn’s disease."

In addition to elderly individuals, children are also at higher risk of CDI-IBD. Rapid diagnosis is essential since the clinical manifestations of active IBD and CDI-IBD are indistinguishable. Antibiotics have been well established in the treatment of CDI-IBD, but they do not prevent recurrence. Areas covered: Herein, the authors focus on reviewing recent research advances on the new therapies of CDI-IBD. The novel therapies include gut microbiota restoration therapies (such as prebiotics, probiotics and FMT), immunotherapy (such as vaccines and monoclonal antibodies) and diet strategies (such as groningen anti-inflammatory diet and mediterranean diet). Future extensive prospective and placebo-controlled studies are required to evaluate their efficacy and long-term safety. Expert opinion: Available studies show that the prevalence of CDI-IBD is not optimistic. Currently, potential treatment options for CDI-IBD include a number of probiotics and novel antibiotics. This review updates the knowledge on the management of CDI in IBD patients, which is timely and important for GI doctors and scientists."
"Relationship between gut microbiota and the pathogenesis of gestational diabetes mellitus: a systematic review","Ma S., Wang Y., Ji X., Dong S., Wang S., Zhang S., Deng F., Chen J., Lin B., Khan B.A., Liu W., Hou K.","Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology","10.3389/fcimb.2024.1364545","14",NA,"2024","Introduction: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of gestational diabetes mellitus characterized by insulin resistance and abnormal function of pancreatic beta cells. In recent years, genomic association studies have revealed risk and susceptibility genes associated with genetic susceptibility to GDM. However, genetic predisposition cannot explain the rising global incidence of GDM, which may be related to the increased influence of environmental factors, especially the gut microbiome. Studies have shown that gut microbiota is closely related to the occurrence and development of GDM. This paper reviews the relationship between gut microbiota and the pathological mechanism of GDM, in order to better understand the role of gut microbiota in GDM, and to provide a theoretical basis for clinical application of gut microbiota in the treatment of related diseases. Methods: The current research results on the interaction between GDM and gut microbiota were collected and analyzed through literature review. Keywords such as ""GDM"", ""gut microbiota"" and ""insulin resistance"" were used for literature search, and the methodology, findings and potential impact on the pathophysiology of GDM were systematically evaluated. Results: It was found that the composition and diversity of gut microbiota were significantly associated with the occurrence and development of GDM. Specifically, the abundance of certain gut bacteria is associated with an increased risk of GDM, while other changes in the microbiome may be associated with improved insulin sensitivity. In addition, alterations in the gut microbiota may affect blood glucose control through a variety of mechanisms, including the production of short-chain fatty acids, activation of inflammatory pathways, and metabolism of the B vitamin group. Discussion: The results of this paper highlight the importance of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of GDM. The regulation of the gut microbiota may provide new directions for the treatment of GDM, including improving insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control through the use of probiotics and prebiotics. However, more research is needed to confirm the generality and exact mechanisms of these findings and to explore potential clinical applications of the gut microbiota in the management of gestational diabetes. In addition, future studies should consider the interaction between environmental and genetic factors and how together they affect the risk of GDM."

Here, we analyzed two cohorts totaling 153 US and UK servicemembers deployed to Honduras or Kenya. These subjects either experienced TD during deployment and received a single dose of one of three antibiotics [Trial Evaluating Ambulatory Therapy of Travelers' Diarrhea (TrEAT TD) cohort] or took once-daily rifaximin (RIF), twice-daily RIF, or placebo as prophylaxis to prevent TD [Trial Evaluating Chemoprophylaxis Against Travelers' Diarrhea (PREVENT TD) cohort]. We applied metagenomic sequencing on 340 longitudinally collected stool samples and whole-genome sequencing on 54 Escherichia coli isolates. We found that gut microbiome taxonomic diversity remained stable across the length of study for most treatment groups, but twice-daily RIF prophylaxis significantly decreased microbiome richness post-travel. Similarly, ARG diversity and abundance were generally stable, with the exception of a significant increase for the twice-daily RIF prophylaxis group. We also did not identify significant differencesdifferencesdifferencesbetween the ARG abundance of E. coli isolates from the TrEAT TD cohort collected from different treatment groups or timepoints.

This paper offers a comprehensive review of the changing characteristics of gut microbiota and their metabolites at different stages of BA in children. It discusses their influence on the host’s inflammatory response, immune system, and bile acid metabolism. The review also explores the potential of gut microbiota and metabolites as a therapeutic target for BA, with interventions like butyrate and gut microbiota preparations showing promise in alleviating BA symptoms.

Despite multiple interventions focusing on nutrition adequacy, 2.7 million children world-wide remain associated with undernutrition-related mortality. The lack of impact from multiple interventions toward undernutrition reflects a strong reason to believe that EED is the missing link that sustains undernutrition in low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs). EED is a sub-clinical condition caused by repeated oral enteropathogenic and non-pathogenic fecal microbes exposure that causes intestinal villous malformation, multi-omics changes, chronic intestinal and systemic inflammation, and gut dysbiosis. EED impacts the absorptive capacity and the integrity of the gut, causing a cycle of undernutrition in children. There is currently no protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of EED, hence EED is widely believed to be highly prevalent and underdiagnosed in LMICs. Objective – To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to study the impact of nutritional interventions on EED. Previous studies yielded inconsistent results, hence the synthesis of this information is essential in attaining a deeper understanding of EED to formulate new targets of intervention against child under-nutrition. Methods – This systematic review is registered to PROSPERO (CRD42022363157) in accordance to PRISMA, using keywords referring to nutrient supplementation, EED, and child growth failure. Results – Eleven articles were eligible for review, comprising randomized controlled trials performed mainly in the African continent, with a total of 5689 healthy children eligible for analysis. Conclusion – The systematic review illustrates that nutritional interventions have a minimal impact on EED biomarkers and linear growth and reflects the importance of understanding better the mechanisms causing EED and its consequences. It appears that the anabolic contribution of nutrition intervention to child growth is negated by EED."

Up to 25% of patients with an initial CDI episode will experience recurrent CDI (rCDI), which most commonly occurs in the first 8 weeks following antibiotic therapy. In patients with first or multiple rCDI, infection, the microbiome is similarly disrupted, which highlights the challenges of using antibiotics alone while underscoring the need for microbiome restoration regardless of the number of recurrences. In this systematic review, we describe the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome in CDI, and systematically review fecal microbiota spores, live-brpk (VOWST™; VOS for Vowst Oral Spores) for prevention of recurrence in rCDI. Methods: The PubMed database was searched using “recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection” AND (SER-109 OR VOS) and limited to clinical trials. The search yielded 7 results: 3 articles describing 3 clinical trials (two Phase 3 trials (ECOSPOR III and ECOSPOR IV) and one Phase 2 trial (ECOSPOR)), 1 describing follow-up of ECOSPOR III, 1 describing a post hoc analysis of comorbidities in ECOSPOR III, and 2 describing health-related quality of life in ECOSPOR III. Results: Compared with placebo, VOS following standard-of-care antibiotics for CDI significantly reduced risk of recurrence at 8 weeks (relative risk, 0.32 (95% CI: 0.18–0.58); p < 0.001; number needed to treat: 4) with a tolerable safety profile; rCDI rates remained low through 24 weeks. The disrupted microbiome, secondary to/exacerbated by antibiotic treatment, was rapidly (i.e., Week 1) restored with VOS. Compared with placebo, VOS demonstrated greater improvements in health-related quality of life. Conclusions: Clinical care of patients with rCDI now includes Food and Drug Administration-approved therapeutics to address microbiome restoration. Clinical trial evidence supports use of VOS following antibiotics and importance of microbiome restoration in rCDI."

A major clinical challenge is recurrent CDI (rCDI) without effective standard drug-based therapy. Additionally, a comprehensive comparison of various therapy effectiveness in rCDI patients is still under investigation. Methods: A Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized control trials up to March 2024 was performed to investigate the efficacy of rCDI interventions. Results: Seventeen trials were included, comprising 4,148 CDI patients with ten interventions, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) by lower gastrointestinal (LGI), FMT by upper gastrointestinal (UGI), Autologous FMT (AFMT), vancomycin + FMT, vancomycin, placebo, fidaxomicin, Vowst (SER109), Rebyota (RBX2660), and monoclonal antibody. NMA showed that FMT by LGI had the highest efficacy in treating rCDIs with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 32.33 (4.03, 248.69) compared with placebo. FMT by UGI also showed high efficacy, whereas the efficacy comparison between FMT by LGI and UGI was not statistically significant (ORs) (95% CI), 1.72 (0.65, 5.21). The rankogram and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) also showed FMT by LGI ranked at the top and FMT by UGI ranked second in the curative effect. Conclusion: NMA demonstrates FMT’s significant efficacy in rCDI management, regardless of administration route (lower or upper gastrointestinal). Despite its significant benefits, FMT’s safety is a concern due to the lack of standardized FDAcompliant manufacturing and oversight. Microbiota-based therapies also exhibit potential. However, limited research mandates further clinical exploration. Antibiotics, in contrast, display comparatively reduced efficacy in rCDI, potentially linked to disruptions in native gut microflora balance.

Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO) is generally referred to as an unexplained prolonged fever. However, a standardized FUO definition and management is missing. Objective: To collect updated data on the approach to fever and FUO among Italian pediatricians. Methods: A cross-sectional anonymous survey was conducted among a large sample of primary care and hospital pediatricians. The panel group formulated and proposed a practical FUO definition, using a modified Delphi approach. A 75% consensus was required to reach an agreement. Results: Among 620 respondents, paracetamol was the first-choice antipyretic for 97.7% of participants, followed by ibuprofen; 38.4% prescribed antipyretics based on a specific body temperature rather than on child's discomfort, while physical methods were almost completely abandoned. Alternate treatment was recommended by 19.8% (123/620) of participants, 16.9% (105/620) would prescribe antipyretics to prevent adverse events following immunization. Regarding FUO diagnosis, 58.3% (362/620) considered as cut-off a body temperature above 38°C; the duration required was one week according to 36.45% (226/620) of participants, two weeks according to 35.32% (219/620). The FUO definition proposed by the expert panel reached 81% of consent. Large agreement was observed on first-level laboratory and instrumental investigations in the diagnostic evaluation of FUO, whereas more discrepancies arose on second and third-level investigations. Compared to what participants reported for the treatment of non-prolonged fever, a significant decrease in the prescription of paracetamol as first-choice drug in children with FUO was observed (80.5%; P < 0.0001). Interestingly, 39% of participants would empirically recommend antibiotics, 13.7% steroids, and 4.5% Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) for persistent FUO. Conclusion: Non-recommended behaviors in fever management persist among pediatricians, including alternating use of paracetamol and ibuprofen, and their prophylactic use for vaccinations. Our data confirm the variability in the definition, work-up, and management of FUO. We observed that in children with FUO paracetamol was significantly less commonly preferred than in non-prolonged fever, which is not supported by evidence. Our findings combined with evidence from existing literature underlined the need for future consensus documents."

Within our cells, a complex molecular dance occurs, where these components intertwine in a mesmerizing ballet that plays a decisive role in our health. Mitochondria, beyond being energy powerhouses, modulate nuclear gene expression through messengers like reactive oxidative stress (ROS) and calcium. Epigenetics, acting as the molecular conductor, regulates the expression of both nuclear and mitochondrial genes through modifications like DNA methylation. The intestinal microbiota itself produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that influence mitochondrial activity. SCFA-induced epigenetic modifications, like histone acetylation, impact mitochondrial function which may lead to disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction generates retrograde signals that alter nuclear gene expression, as evidenced by increased histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in genes essential for neuronal differentiation and mitochondrial reprogramming. Alterations in the mitochondrial-nuclear-microbiota axis are associated with diseases including diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Modulating the intestinal microbiota with probiotics or prebiotics can restore balance while intervening in mitochondrial pathways, which can be a therapeutic strategy. Additionally, using epigenetic agents like histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can reprogram gene expression and improve mitochondrial function. Finally, the present review aims to explore the central interplay between mitochondria, epigenetics modifications, and microbiota in a complex and dynamic molecular context that plays a fundamental role in human health. Specifically, it will examine the impact of microbiome components and metabolites generated from normobiosis and dysbiosis on mitochondria and epigenetic modifications across different diseases and metabolic conditions. This integrated understanding of the molecular players and their interactions provides a deeper perspective on how to promote health and potentially combat disease."

This study aims to compare the effectiveness and tolerance of these dietary therapy strategies for active pediatric CD. Methods: We searched the medical literature up to August 30, 2024 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of dietary therapy strategies for pediatric CD. The primary outcomes were clinical remission rate and tolerance, secondary outcomes included differences between pre- and post-treatment levels of albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fecal calprotectin levels. A network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed by using the frequentist model. For binary outcome variables and continuous outcome variables, odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were utilized, respectively. The ranking of dietary therapy strategies was determined based on the surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) for each comparison analyzed. Results: Overall, 14 studies involving 564 participants were included. In terms of clinical remission rate, the partial enteral nutrition (PEN) plus Crohn’s disease exclusion diet (PEN+CDED) (OR = 7.86, 95% CI [1.85–33.40]) and exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) (OR = 3.74, 95% CI [1.30–10.76]) exhibited significant superiority over PEN alone. The tolerance of PEN+CDED was significantly higher than that of EEN (OR = 0.07, 95% CI [0.01–0.61]). According to the surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) values, the PEN+CDED intervention (90.5%) achieved the highest ranking in clinical remission rate. In terms of tolerance, PEN+CDED ranked first (88.0%), while EEN ranked last (16.3%). Conclusions: In conclusion, PEN+CDED was associated with the highest clinical remission rate and tolerance among the various dietary therapy strategies evaluated. Despite limitations in the studies, this systematic review provides evidence that PEN +CDED can be used as an alternative treatment to exclusive enteral nutrition and is more suitable for long-term management in children."

However, it remains uncertain when exploring the preferable option among different CHM therapies for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Aim of the study: To compare and rank the efﬁcacy and safety of different CHM therapies for IBS-D. Materials and methods: We searched randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials through mainstream databases from their inception to October 31, 2022. Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) applied one of the CHM therapies as the experimental group and placebo as the control group. Two authors independently extracted data into a form and evaluated the quality of the retrieved articles by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. At least one of the following outcomes was assessed: Serotonin, Neuropeptide Y (NPY), Incidence of Adverse Events (AE), and Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) with its subscales of Severity of Abdominal Pain (SAP), Frequency of Abdominal Pain (FAP), Severity of Abdominal Distension (SAD), Dissatisfaction with Bowel Habits (DBH), and Interference with Quality of Life (IQOL). A Bayesian network meta-analysis on a random-effect model was conducted using R 4.2.2 software. Results: 1367 records were retrieved from databases in an initial search. Fourteen studies involving six interventions with 2248 participants were identified. Provided pairwise comparisons, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) ranking, and cluster analysis, JPWS was the best option for ameliorating clinical symptoms simultaneously, which included IBS-SSS, SAP, FAP, SAD, DBH, and IQOL. As for AE, JPWS contributed to fewer adverse events than others as well. In respect of serum indicators, we noticed the dominance of SGJP in regulating both serotonin and NPY. Conclusions: JPWS and SGJP were the most prominent CHM therapies for IBS-D in terms of clinical symptoms, including abdominal pain, distension, bowel habits, and improvement of quality of life. The effect of JP and SG for IBS-D required further investigation. As a potential candidate, SGJP may well treat IBS-D by mediating dysmotility, visceral hypersensitivity, and the gut-brain axis with an increase of NPY and a reduction of serotonin. For safety, JPWS was ideal for the fewest adverse events in the treatment of IBS-D. On account of a small sample size and possible geographical publication bias, more double-blinded and placebo-controlled trials with larger samples worldwide would be necessary for strengthening current evidence."

Recent evidence suggests that the early-life gut microbiome affects child growth through immune, metabolic and endocrine pathways. Using whole metagenomic sequencing, we map the assembly of the gut microbiome in 335 children from rural Zimbabwe from 1–18 months of age who were enrolled in the Sanitation, Hygiene, Infant Nutrition Efficacy Trial (SHINE; NCT01824940), a randomized trial of improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and infant and young child feeding (IYCF). Here, we show that the early-life gut microbiome undergoes programmed assembly that is unresponsive to the randomized interventions intended to improve linear growth. However, maternal HIV infection is associated with over-diversification and over-maturity of the early-life gut microbiome in their uninfected children, in addition to reduced abundance of Bifidobacterium species. Using machine learning models (XGBoost), we show that taxonomic microbiome features are poorly predictive of child growth, however functional metagenomic features, particularly B-vitamin and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways, moderately predict both attained linear and ponderal growth and growth velocity. New approaches targeting the gut microbiome in early childhood may complement efforts to combat child undernutrition."

In the subgroup analysis by study design, a higher eradication rate was reported from observational studies (85%, 95% CI: 79%-90%), compared to randomized control trials (77%, 95% CI: 73%-82%); by the duration of therapy, higher eradication rate was reported in 10-days regimen (88%, 95% CI: 84%-92%), compared to 7-days regimen (66%, 95% CI: 55%-77%); by country, the highest eradication rate was found in Ethiopia (90%; 95% CI: 87%-93%) and the lowest eradication rate was reported in Ivory Coast (22.3%; 95% CI:15%-29%); by type of H. pylori test, the highest eradication rate was reported when rapid urease test coupled with histology (88%, 95% CI: 77%-96%), and the lowest eradication rate was reported with histology alone (22.3%; 95% CI:15%-29%). Significant heterogeneity was observed with pooled prevalence (I(2) = 93.02%, P < 0.000). Conclusions: In Africa, the first-line therapy showed a variable eradication rate for H. pylori. This study demonstrates the necessity to optimize current H. pylori treatment regimens in each country, taking into account the antibiotic susceptibility. Future RCT studies with standardized regimens are warranted."
"The potential role of the microbiota in prostate cancer pathogenesis and treatment","Pernigoni N., Guo C., Gallagher L., Yuan W., Colucci M., Troiani M., Liu L., Maraccani L., Guccini I., Migliorini D., de Bono J., Alimonti A.","Nature Reviews Urology","10.1038/s41585-023-00795-2","20","12","2023","The human body hosts a complex and dynamic population of trillions of microorganisms — the microbiota — which influences the body in homeostasis and disease, including cancer. Several epidemiological studies have associated specific urinary and gut microbial species with increased risk of prostate cancer; however, causal mechanistic data remain elusive. Studies have associated bacterial generation of genotoxins with the occurrence of TMPRSS2–ERG gene fusions, a common, early oncogenic event during prostate carcinogenesis. A subsequent study demonstrated the role of the gut microbiota in prostate cancer endocrine resistance, which occurs, at least partially, through the generation of androgenic steroids fuelling oncogenic signalling via the androgen receptor. These studies present mechanistic evidence of how the host microbiota might be implicated in prostate carcinogenesis and tumour progression. Importantly, these findings also reveal potential avenues for the detection and treatment of prostate cancer through the profiling and modulation of the host microbiota. The latter could involve approaches such as the use of faecal microbiota transplantation, prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics or antibiotics, which can be used independently or combined with existing treatments to reverse therapeutic resistance and improve clinical outcomes in patients with prostate cancer."
"Efficacy of mouthwash on reducing salivary SARS-CoV-2 viral load and clinical symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Zhang M., Meng N., Duo H., Yang Y., Dong Q., Gu J.","BMC Infectious Diseases","10.1186/s12879-023-08669-z","23","1","2023","Background: COVID-19 has been a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) for a lengthy period of time. The novel coronavirus is primarily spread via aerosols at a short distance, with infected individuals releasing large amounts of aerosols when speaking and coughing. However, there is an open question regarding whether mouthwash could effectively reduce virus transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic and support the prevention of infection among medical workers. Methods: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases were systematically searched from the inception of each database to January 12, 2023 for currently available randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on the effect of mouthwash on novel coronavirus load in the oral cavity in COVID-19 patients. The treatment group received mouthwash for rinsing the mouth, while the control group received a placebo or distilled water for COVID-19 patients. The primary outcomes were CT value and viral load. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using a random-effects model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to minimize the bias and the impact of heterogeneity. Results: Thirteen RCTs were included. Seven studies reported the intervention effect of mouthwash on the CT value of novel coronavirus. The analysis results showed that the mouthwash group had a positive impact on the CT value of novel coronavirus [SMD = 0.35, 95% CI (0.21, 0.50)] compared with the control group. In addition, subgroup analysis showed a significant positive effect of mouthwash on CT values in the treatment group compared with the control group, with chlorhexidine (CHX) [SMD = 0.33, 95% CI (0.10, 0.56)], povidone-iodine (PVP-I) [SMD = 0.61, 95% CI (0.23, 0.99)], or hydrogen peroxide (HP) [SMD = 1.04, 95% CI (0.30, 1.78)] as an ingredient of the mouthwash. Six studies reported the intervention effect of mouthwash on the viral load, 263 cases in the treatment group and 164 cases in the control group. The analysis results showed that there was no statistical difference between the mouthwash group and the control group in the viral load of novel coronavirus [SMD = -0.06, 95% CI (-0.18, 0.05)]. In the subgroup analysis by measurement time, there were statistically significant differences between the mouthwash and control groups for CT values [SMD = 0.52, 95% CI (0.31, 0.72)] and viral load [SMD = − 0.32, 95% CI (− 0.56, − 0.07)] within 30 min of gargling. Conclusions: In summary, mouthwash has some efficacy in reducing the viral load of novel coronavirus, especially within 30 min after rinsing the mouth. Mouthwash containing CHX, PVP-I and HP all had significant positive effects on CT values, and PVP-I-containing mouthwash may be a promising option to control novel coronavirus infections and relieve virus-related symptoms. However, studies on the dose and frequency of use of mouthwash for infection control are still lacking, which may limit the clinical application of mouthwash. Trial registration: Protocol registration: The protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42023401961)."

Rectal injury is a common adverse effect of abdominal and pelvic radiotherapy. This injury is caused by administering radiation to the abdomen. Appropriate treatment techniques can be determined if doctors have a better understanding of the incidence, risk factors, and clinical symptoms of radiation-induced rectal injuries. Studies on the underlying pathophysiology of radiation-induced rectal injury may aid in the development of effective treatment and prevention strategies. The implementation of efficient preventive measures can improve the quality of life of patients with cancer and make it easier for them to complete their treatment. Therefore, comprehensive and accurate assessments are crucial for developing holistic and individualized treatment plans for patients who have already developed symptoms, with early intervention being a priority."

Methods: CNKI, Wanfang Academic Journal Full Text Database, VIP, Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for clinical studies on the treatment of IBS using Chinese patent medicines that were published from inception until March 15, 2023. The shortlisted data were strictly screened and the data were extracted and evaluated, followed by data analyses and collation using RevMan 5.4 and stata16 software. Results: The final 21 randomized controlled trials(RCT), which included 14 proprietary Chinese medicines that were all orally administered, were in a total population of 2007 patients. Meta-analysis revealed that the combination of Chinese patent medicines with Western medicines could improve the overall clinical effectiveness (OR = 3.81, 95 % CI [2.84–5.12], P < 0.00001); significantly improved the abdominal pain scores (MD = -0.66, 95 % CI [-0.93, -0.40], P < 0.00001); improved the stool trait scores (MD = -0.48, 95 % CI [-0.59, -0.37], P < 0.00001); improved the IBS symptom severity scale(IBS-SSS) scores (MD = -44.36, 95 % CI [-53.64, -35.08], P < 0.00001); improved IBS quality of life(IBS-QOL) -positive (MD = 10.27, 95 % CI [3.50, 17.04], P = 0.003 < 0.05) and -negative scores (MD = -7.91, 95 % CI[-15.62, -0.02], P = 0.04 < 0.05); and improved the Hamilton Anxiety Scale(HAMA) scores (MD = -3.37, 95 % CI [-6.49, -0.24], P = 0.03); albeit no statistical difference was noted in improving Hamilton Depression Scale(HAMD) scores (MD = -2.83, 95 % CI [-5.74, 0.08], P = 0.06 > 0.05). Conclusion: For treating irritable bowel syndrome, the effectiveness of combining Chinese patent medicine with Western medicine is better than that of using Western medicine alone both in terms of relieving gastrointestinal discomfort and regulating mood. However, as the sample size was limited, it is advisable to conduct large-scale, high-quality, and rigorous randomized controlled trials to enhance the clinical evidence."

"Study protocol to investigate the efficacy of confocal laser endomicroscopy-based selective single-elimination diet over standard fivefold elimination diet in patients with endomicroscopically proven food intolerance: app-assisted, monocentric, double-blind, randomised and controlled trial in Germany","Heßler N., Kordowski A., Sasse J., Ahlemann G., Schulz F., Schröder T., Exner A., Jablonski L., Jappe U., Bischoff S.C., Grzegorzek M., König I.R., Sina C.","BMJ Open","10.1136/bmjopen-2023-072024","13","11","2023","Introduction Imprecise nutritional recommendations due to a lack of diagnostic test accuracy are a frequent problem for individuals with adverse reactions to foods but no precise diagnosis. Consequently, patients follow very broad and strict elimination diets to avoid uncontrolled symptoms such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Dietary limitations and the uncertainty of developing gastrointestinal symptoms after the inadvertent ingestion of food have been demonstrated to reduce the quality of life (QoL) of affected individuals and subsequently might increase the risk of malnutrition and intestinal dysbiosis. This trial aims to investigate the effects of a tailored diet based on the confocal laser endoscopy (CLE) examination result to limit the side effects of unspecific and broad elimination diets and to increase the patient’s QoL. Methods and analysis The study is designed as a prospective, double-blind, monocentric, randomised and controlled trial conducted at the University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Lübeck, Germany. One hundred seventy-two patients with non-IgE-related food allergies and positive CLE results will be randomised to either a tailored diet or a standard fivefold elimination diet. The primary endpoints are the difference between the end and the start of the intervention in health-related QoL and the sum score of the severity of symptoms after 12 weeks. Key secondary endpoints are changes in the severity of symptoms, further QoL measurements, self-assessed state of health and number of days with a pathologically altered stool. Microbiome diversity and metabolome of stool, urine and blood will also be investigated. Safety endpoints are body composition, body mass index and adverse events. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was accepted by the ethical committee of the University of Lübeck (AZ: 22-111) on 4 May2022. Results of the study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings."

We comprehensively evaluated the efficacy of MTTs in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods: Data from randomized controlled trials were collected through MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrial.gov from inception to February 20, 2023. Clinical outcomes were pooled and expressed in terms of risk ratios or mean differences (MD). Additional subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the robustness of findings. A trial sequential analysis was applied to calculate the required information size and evaluate the credibility of the meta-analysis results. Results: Twenty-one studies with a total of 1699 cirrhotic patients were included for meta-analysis. MTTs were associated with a significant reduction in aspartate aminotransferase (MD, −3.62; 95% CI, −6.59 to −0.65), the risk of hepatic encephalopathy (risk ratio = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.68), model for end-stage liver disease score (MD, −0.90; 95% CI, −1.17 to −0.11), ammonia (MD, −11.86; 95% CI, −16.39 to −7.33), and endotoxin (MD, −0.14; 95% CI, −0.23 to −0.04). The trial sequential analysis yielded reliable results of these outcomes. No effects were observed on the changes of other hepatic function indicators. Conclusion: MTTs appeared to be associated with a slowed deterioration in liver cirrhosis, which could provide reference for clinicians in treatment of cirrhotic patients based on their conditions."

Despite the very significant economic and environmental advantages of multiple-use catheters, the single-use option is still promoted. The increasing focus on sustainability in urology may prompt a shift in practice to multiple-use catheters or other novel solutions in this setting. Patient summary: In intermittent catheterization, a patient or their caregiver periodically inserts a catheter to drain the bladder of urine. Single-use catheters are more expensive and have a greater impact on the environment than resuable catheters that are cleaned after use. To improve sustainability in health care, a switch from single-use to multiple-use catheters or other novel soultions for intermittent catheterization should be considered."

Clinical manifestations include slowly developing resting tremor, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia and abnormal gait. The pathological mechanisms underlying PD are complex and yet to be fully elucidated. Clinical studies suggest that the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms may precede motor symptoms in PD patients. The microbiota-gut-brain axis plays a bidirectional communication role between the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system. This bidirectional communication between the brain and gut is influenced by the neural, immune and endocrine systems related to the gut microbiome. A growing body of evidence indicates a strong link between dysregulation of the gut microbiota and PD. In this review, we present recent progress in understanding the relationship between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and PD. We focus on the role of the gut microbiota, the unique changes observed in the microbiome of PD patients, and the impact of these changes on the progression of PD. Finally, we evaluate the role of current treatment strategies for PD, including probiotics, fecal microbial transplants, dietary modifications, and related drug therapies."

Many patients do not reach the complete symptom alleviation, even by strict GFD. Recent studies have reported inconsistent results regarding the beneficial benefits of taking probiotics. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and the possible underlying causes in CD and celiac disease autoimmunity (CDA) patients. Databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science and Google Scholar, were searched for clinical trials published until July 2022 about assessing the effects of probiotics or synbiotics on CD or CDA patients. We collected data on GI symptoms, CD markers, inflammatory and immune responses, adverse events, and gut microbiota. A random effect meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and confidence interval (CI). We screened 7234 articles, of which 14 were included in the qualitative analysis and 5 in the quantitative analysis. Probiotics might alleviate GI symptoms, especially in the highly symptomatic patients, and improve immune response in CD and CDA patients. Results of the meta-analysis showed that probiotics increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium (SMD: 0.72, 95%CI (0.13, 1.30) and Lactobacillus (SMD: 0.49, 95%CI (0.18, 0.80) as compared with placebo. Probiotics did not increase the adverse events compared to the placebo. Probiotics might alleviate GI symptoms and immune response and improve dysbiosis in CD and CDA patients. However, high-quality clinical trials are needed to increase the level of evidence. Also, the most suitable combination of probiotics is yet to find."

Our group has investigated how a Mediterranean-type diet and its subsequent effect on the microbiome may improve metabolic health, lung function and decrease inflammation in World Trade Center (WTC)-particulate matter (PM) exposed firefighters with lung disease. METHODS: Design/Specimens: Our randomized clinical trial Food Intake REstriction for Health OUtcome Support and Education (FIREHOUSE); Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03581006 collected stool at baseline and 6 months post-intervention (OMNIgene-GUT kits; DNAgenotek) for a pilot N=5 in the low-calorie Mediterranean (LoCalMed) and N=5 Usual Care (UC) and validation cohort (N=15 and N=16 respectively). Microbiome was assessed using sequencing (BoosterShot Shotgun, Diversigen) and alignment of sequences to a bacterial database (Diversigen). Chao1 index, Shannon Index and operational taxonomic unit counts (OTU, taxonomic group) were calculated using a rarefied, filtered taxonomy table set to the minimum depth allowed for a sample (10,000). Bray-Curtis beta-diversity was calculated from the filtered taxonomy and KEGG module/enzyme relative abundance tables. QIIME 1.9.1, R and SPSS-28 software were used for analysis. RESULTS: Mean age, exposure at the WTC site and years of service were similar in both arms. Subjects were predominantly Caucasian. Shannon (a) diversity did not differ between arms at either timepoint, but decreased across time for the cohort (p=0.02 pilot, p<0.0001 validation). Similarly, microbial community composition (b-diversity) did not differ between arms at either timepoint or between timepoints. The abundance of specific microbial taxa did differ between timepoints in the pilot in that Bilophila wadsworthia had a higher relative abundance at the 6-month timepoint compared to baseline in the UC arm only. When incorporating health measures with microbiome analysis, a BMI reduction was associated with an increase in the abundance of Bacteroides ovatus in combined arm data(p=0.06). In the validation LoCalMed arm the family Ruminococcaceae decreased(p=0.015) when comparing post-intervention to baseline. In the UC arm the order Veillonellales (p=0.032);genus Anaeromassilibacillus(p=0.012); Johnsonella(p=0.042); Subdoligranulum(p=0.019); and species Bacteroides massiliensis(p=0.027); Alistipes ihumii (p=0.034); Clostridium asparagiforme (p=0.018) were reduced when comparing post-intervention to baseline. In contrast the species Bacteroides ovatus (p=0.03) and Alistipes shahii (p=0.038) were increased. CONCLUSIONS: In our UC pilot, Bilophila wadsworthia was increased and of note in the literature this bacterial species is associated with high fat diets and inflammation. In addition, health metrics such as BMI were associated with changes in Bacteroides ovatus. In our validation cohort Bacteroides ovatus was increased in the LoCalMed arm after 6-months. In a high fat diet consuming murine model gavaged with Bacteroides ovatus there were fewer negative health effects. Future studies will assess microbial association with clinical outcomes. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The FIREHOUSE RCT focuses on a multiOMIC comprehensive assessment of WTC-PM exposure associated lung disease and leverages the longitudinally phenotyped FDNY cohort to not only provide pathophysiologic insight but also to lay the groundwork for future therapeutics.

However, they have always been considered to have a double-faced role, according to their capacity to manage inflammation but also their possible reduction of immune system response and diagnosis delay. This last point could favor a dramatic increase of viral infection diffusion, possibly leading to a more severe outcome. The advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 excluded the use of NSAIDs, particularly ibuprofen, and then indicated this drug as the better NSAID to manage infected outpatients and prevent complications. Several authors described the role of NSAIDs and ibuprofen in preventing cytokine storm and modulating the immune system. However, the development of both adverse drug reactions (i.e., gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular) and drug interaction recalled the necessity of prescribing the better NSAID for each patient. In this narrative review, we describe the role of NSAIDs, particularly of ibuprofen, in the management of viral symptoms, suggesting that the NSAID may be chosen considering the characteristics of the patient, the comorbidity, and the polytherapy."

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and, specifically, its subtype nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a rising cause of liver disease. It is predicted to surpass hepatitis C as a leading indication for transplant. The introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) decreased the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C infections, but the obesity epidemic and metabolic syndrome have increased the prevalence of NASH. Weight loss and dietary modifications are recommended NASH therapies, but unlike for hepatitis C, federally approved agents are lacking and currently under investigation. Clinical trials face many barriers in NASH treatment because of the difficulty of diagnosis and a lack of standardized and accurate clinical and histologic responses. Mortality and morbidity in NASH are heightened because of the presence of multiple comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and renal dysfunction. A liver transplant may be indicated, but a thorough screening of candidates, including a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment, is essential to ensuring successful outcomes pre- and post-transplant. Therapeutic agents for NASH are warranted before it becomes a significant and leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide."

Probiotics, synbiotics and FMT significantly reversed minimal HE (MHE) (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.19-0.90, P = 0.03), reduced overt HE (OHE) development (OR, 0.41; 95% CI: 0.28-0.61 P < 0.00001)and the frequency of serious adverse events(SAEs) (OR:0.14, 95% CI: 0.04-0.47, P = 0.001), meanwhile decreased ammonia levels (WMD:-9.26, 95% CI:-16.92 to-1.61; P = 0.02), NCT level (MD =-4.41, 95% CI:-0.87 to-0.22, P = 0.04) and hospitalization rates (OR, 0.38; 95% CI: 0.19-0.79, P = 0.009) compared with placebo/no treatment. Finally, we conclude that microbiome therapies were more effective in improving MHE and preventing progression to OHE, reducing the frequency of SAEs, and decreasing ammonia levels, NCT level, and hospitalization rates when compared to placebo/no treatment."

"Current and future treatment for alcoholic-related liver diseases","Yoon E.L., Kim W.","Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (Australia)","10.1111/jgh.16257","38","8","2023","The socioeconomic burden of alcohol-related liver disease has been increasing worldwide. Its prevalence is underestimated, and patients with alcohol-related liver disease are rarely diagnosed in the earlier phase of the disease spectrum. Alcoholic hepatitis is a distinct syndrome with life-threatening signs of systemic inflammation. In severe alcoholic hepatitis, prednisolone is indicated as the first-line treatment even with the possibility of various complications. Early liver transplantation can be another option for highly selected patients with a null response to prednisolone. Most importantly, abstinence is the mainstay of long-term care, but relapse is frequent among patients. Recent findings on the pathogenesis of alcoholic hepatitis have enabled us to discover new therapeutic targets. Preventing hepatic inflammation, reducing oxidative stress, improving gut dysbiosis, and enhancing liver regeneration are the main targets of emerging therapies. Herein, we review the pathogenesis, current treatment, and barriers to successful clinical trials of alcoholic hepatitis. Additionally, clinical trials for alcoholic hepatitis, either ongoing or recently completed, will be briefly introduced."
"Rapid Diagnostics to Enhance Therapy Selection for the Treatment of Bacterial Infections","Ryu H.Y., Abdul Azim A., Bhatt P.J., Uprety P., Mohayya S., Dixit D., Kirn T.J., Narayanan N.","Current Pharmacology Reports","10.1007/s40495-023-00323-1","9","4","2023","Purpose of Review: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) may reduce morbidity and mortality related to bacterial infections by reducing time to identification of pathogens and antibiotic resistance mechanisms. There has been a significant increase in the breadth and depth of available technology utilized by RDTs. Recent Findings: There are numerous Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared assays for rapid detection of bacteria from various specimen types from sites including blood, stool, central nervous system, and respiratory tract. Most RDTs currently FDA-cleared are molecular tests designed as syndromic panels that provide identification of on-panel organisms and resistance genes. One FDA-cleared rapid phenotypic assay for antimicrobial susceptibility testing is currently available and others are in development. Studies of these technologies’ clinical impact consistently demonstrate improvements in clinical care processes such as time to de-escalation and escalation of antibiotic therapy, particularly for blood and respiratory specimen tests. Other RDTs show inconsistent impact on antibiotic use. Antimicrobial stewardship programs are vital to ensure the greatest benefit from RDTs in clinical practice. Summary: The advancement and implementation of RDTs, in conjunction with antimicrobial stewardship, to enhance treatment selection for bacterial infections should be regarded as a core element to improve clinical outcomes for patients. Although challenges exist in the use of RDTs, there is a need for continued innovation in technology, implementation science, and collaboration across clinical professions to optimize care."

Methods: A search of Medline, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Open Grey, and Google Scholar was conducted for eligible publications from 2002 to 2020 following the requirements outlined in the PRISMA guideline. The search strategy was based on the combination of the following terms: “probiotics,” “prebiotics,” “synbiotics,” and “cross-infection.” The logical operators “AND” (or the equivalent operator for the databases) and “OR” (e.g., probiotics OR prebiotics OR synbiotics) were used. Results: The results indicated that the probiotic consumption caused a significant reduction in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in 2/8 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating AAD/CDI. Also, 5/12 clinical trials highlighted the considerable effects of probiotics on the reduction or prevention of ventilator associated pneumoniae (VAP), so the mean prevalence of VAP was lower in the probiotic group than in the placebo group. The total rate of nosocomial infections among preterm infants was nonsignificantly higher in the probiotic group compared to the control group. Conclusion: This systematic review shows that the administration of probiotics has moderate preventive or mitigating effects on the occurrence of VAP in ICU patients, CDI, AAD, and nosocomial infections among children. Consequently, applying antibiotics along with the proper probiotic species can be advantageous."

The increasing prevalence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics calls for a reduction in unnecessary antibiotic use. The aim of this review was to create an updated summary of the available data on the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing the postoperative infection in clean and clean-contaminated plastic surgery. A systematic literature search was performed on the databases Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus, limited to articles published January 2000 onward. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the primary review, whereas older RCTs and other studies were sought if 2 or fewer relevant RCTs were identified. Overall, 28 relevant RCTs, 2 nonrandomized trials, and 15 cohort studies were identified. Although the number of studies for each type of surgery is limited, the data suggest that prophylactic systemic antibiotic may be unnecessary in noncontaminated facial plastic surgery, reduction mammaplasty, and breast augmentation. In addition, no benefit is apparent from extending the antibiotic prophylaxis over 24 h in rhinoplasty, aerodigestive tract reconstruction, and breast reconstruction. No studies assessing the necessity of antibiotic prophylaxis in abdominoplasty, lipotransfer, soft tissue tumor surgery, or gender affirmation surgery were identified. In conclusion, limited data are available on the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in clean and clean-contaminated plastic surgery. More studies on this topic are needed before strong recommendations can be made on the use of antibiotics in this setting."

"The effects of prebiotics intervention on gut microbiota and short chain fatty acid in healthy adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Wang J.H., Hsiang Lin S.","Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism","10.1159/000530786","79",NA,"2023","Background and objectives: Gut microbiota can be affected by genetic, western diet, poor lifestyle, stress and aging, and cause the dysbiosis. Dysbiosis have already been implicated in multiple diseases such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes, while recent search suggests a potential role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as cognitive deficit disorders and depression. Diet is one of the major factor to modify the gut microbiota composition, and prebiotics supplementation may increase specific bacterial numbers and metabolites, including short-chain fatty acid (SCFA). In this study, a systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken to assess the effect of prebiotics intervention on gut microbiota and SCFA in healthy adults. Methods: A systematic search was conducted including Cochrane library, EMBASE, and Pubmed for these inclusive criteria: (1) randomized controlled trials; (2) healthy adults aged 18-65 yr; (3) prebiotics intervention compare to placebo or no supplement; (4) using culture and/or molecular microbiological techniques and mass spectrometric techniques; (5) major outcome were gut microbiota composition and/or metabolites SCFA. Meta-analyses via a random-effects model were performed on specified bacterial abundances including Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Bacteroides and fecal SCFA concentrations comparing prebiotics interventions with placebo comparators. Results: Twenty two independent studies involving 810 healthy adults were included in the present meta-analysis. Prebiotics intervention resulted in higher abundance of Bifidobacterium (standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.72; 95% CI: 0.32, 1.10) compared with placebo/ no supplement comparators. No differences in effect were found between prebiotics intervention and comparators for abundances of other bacteria, or all SCFA concentrations. Conclusions: The present meta-analysis shows that prebiotics interventions, involving xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS) , inulin, fructans, and partially hydrolyzed guar gum, lead to a higher abundance of Bifidobacterium, but other bacteria and fecal SCFA show no trend."

The objective of this study was to conduct the first systematic literature review (SLR) to assess the humanistic burden of CDI on patient experiences, including HRQoL and related constructs, and attitudes towards treatment alternatives. Methods: An SLR was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles that assessed CDI, including recurrent CDI (rCDI), and patient-reported outcomes or HRQoL. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Collaboration abstracting services were used to conduct literature searches from 2010 to 2021 in the English language. This SLR was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Results: Of 511 identified articles, 21 met study inclusion criteria. The SLR showed CDI has a devastating impact on patients’ overall HRQoL that continues well beyond infection clearance. The impact of CDI on physical, emotional, social, and professional well-being rivaled abdominal symptoms of uncontrollable diarrhea, being worse for patients with rCDI. Patients with CDI feel isolated, depressed, lonely, and continue to be frightened of recurrences as well as being contagious to others. Most believe that they will never be free of CDI. Conclusion: CDI and rCDI are debilitating conditions affecting physical, psychological, social, and professional functioning of patients’ HRQoL, even long after the event has occurred. The results of this SLR suggest that CDI is a devastating condition in need of better prevention strategies, improved psychological support, and treatments that address the microbiome disruption to break the cycle of recurrence. Additional safe and effective therapies are needed to address this unmet medical need."
"Insights into the Evolving Epidemiology of Clostridioides difficile Infection and Treatment: A Global Perspective","Liu C., Monaghan T., Yadegar A., Louie T., Kao D.","Antibiotics","10.3390/antibiotics12071141","12","7","2023","Clostridioides difficile remains an important public health threat, globally. Since the emergence of the hypervirulent strain, ribotype 027, new strains have been reported to cause C. difficile infection (CDI) with poor health outcomes, including ribotypes 014/020, 017, 056, 106, and 078/126. These strains differ in their geographic distribution, genetic makeup, virulence factors, and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, which can affect their ability to cause disease and respond to treatment. As such, understanding C. difficile epidemiology is increasingly important to allow for effective prevention measures. Despite the heightened epidemiological surveillance of C. difficile over the past two decades, it remains challenging to accurately estimate the burden and international epidemiological trends given the lack of concerted global effort for surveillance, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This review summarizes the changing epidemiology of C. difficile based on available data within the last decade, highlights the pertinent ribotypes from a global perspective, and discusses evolving treatments for CDI."
"Efficacy and safety of the ghrelin-O-acyltransferase inhibitor BI 1356225 in overweight/obesity: Data from two Phase I, randomised, placebo-controlled studies","Bianzano S., Henrich A., Herich L., Kalsch B., Sarubbi D., Seitz F., Forst T.","Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental","10.1016/j.metabol.2023.155550","143",NA,"2023","Background: Obesity is a complex disease associated with multiple concurrent complications, and the coordinated targeting of multiple pathways in pharmacological treatment may improve weight loss outcomes. During synthesis, ghrelin is converted from the ‘inactive’ unacylated ghrelin (UAG) to the active acylated ghrelin (AG) by the enzyme ghrelin-O-acyltransferase (GOAT), stimulating appetite and food intake. Aims: To report the results of two Phase I studies investigating single rising doses (SRDs) or multiple rising doses (MRDs) of the novel oral GOAT inhibitor BI 1356225 versus placebo in male and postmenopausal/sterilised female subjects with overweight or obesity. Methods: The SRD study investigated single doses of BI 1356225 (0.1–20.0 mg) in healthy male subjects with a BMI of 18.5–29.9 kg/m(2) (SRD cohort) and assessed doses of 2.5 mg BI 1356225 under fed and fasted conditions (bioavailability [BA] cohort). The MRD study investigated multiple doses of BI 1356225 (0.2, 1.0, 2.5 or 10.0 mg) or 5.0 mg BI 1356225 with a single dose of midazolam and celecoxib (drug–drug interaction part) over 28 days in adults with a BMI of 27.0–39.9 kg/m(2). Results: Sixty-five subjects were treated in the SRD study. Drug-related adverse events (AEs) were reported for five subjects (9.1 %) in the SRD cohort and two subjects (20.0 %) in the BA cohort, with the most frequent being headache (SRD: n = 4, 9.8 %; BA: n = 1, 10.0 %). In the MRD study, two (2.3 %) of the 87 subjects treated discontinued treatment because of AEs. Drug-related AEs were reported for 18 subjects (20.7 %), did not increase with dose and were most frequently reported as headache (n = 5, 5.7 %) and gastrointestinal disorders (n = 5, 5.7 %). In both studies, exposure parameters (area under the concentration–time curve [AUC] and maximum plasma concentration [C(max)]) of BI 1356225 increased across dose groups, although this was less than dose-proportional across the entire dose range. In the BA cohort of the SRD study, AUC(0–∞) was slightly increased and C(max) slightly decreased in fed versus fasted conditions, with fed/fasted ratios (90 % CI) of 101.10 % (92.42, 110.60) and 91.67 % (78.50, 107.05), respectively. In both studies, AG concentrations and the AG/UAG ratio were dose-dependently decreased after BI 1356225 treatment from baseline versus placebo. In the MRD study, UAG concentrations were increased from baseline, but not dose-dependently. No differences were observed in bodyweight, appetite, food cravings, ad libitum food uptake or obesity-related biomarkers after 28 days of treatment with BI 1356225. Conclusions: Treatment with SRDs and MRDs of BI 1356225 was well tolerated by healthy males and subjects with overweight/obesity. BI 1356225 treatment over 28 days reduced AG concentrations and the AG/UAG ratio by >80 %, but no effect was seen on bodyweight, hunger/satiety, control of eating or energy intake. Although, at 4 weeks, the MRD study was fairly short, a reduction in bodyweight would be expected to be evident by this time, suggesting that a reduction of AG via a GOAT inhibitor is not sufficient to induce clinically relevant bodyweight loss."
"The brain-gut-microbiota interplay in depression: A key to design innovative therapeutic approaches","Varesi A., Campagnoli L.I.M., Chirumbolo S., Candiano B., Carrara A., Ricevuti G., Esposito C., Pascale A.","Pharmacological Research","10.1016/j.phrs.2023.106799","192",NA,"2023","Depression is the most prevalent mental disorder in the world associated with huge socio-economic consequences. While depressive-related symptoms are well known, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathophysiology and progression remain largely unknown. The gut microbiota (GM) is emerging as a key regulator of the central nervous system homeostasis by exerting fundamental immune and metabolic functions. In turn, the brain influences the intestinal microbial composition through neuroendocrine signals, within the so-called gut microbiota-brain axis. The balance of this bidirectional crosstalk is important to ensure neurogenesis, preserve the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and avoid neuroinflammation. Conversely, dysbiosis and gut permeability negatively affect brain development, behavior, and cognition. Furthermore, although not fully defined yet, changes in the GM composition in depressed patients are reported to influence the pharmacokinetics of common antidepressants by affecting their absorption, metabolism, and activity. Similarly, neuropsychiatric drugs may shape in turn the GM with an impact on the efficacy and toxicity of the pharmacological intervention itself. Consequently, strategies aimed at re-establishing the correct homeostatic gut balance (i.e., prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and dietary interventions) represent an innovative approach to improve the pharmacotherapy of depression. Among these, probiotics and the Mediterranean diet, alone or in combination with the standard of care, hold promise for clinical application. Therefore, the disclosure of the intricate network between GM and depression will give precious insights for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches towards depression, with profound implications for drug development and clinical practice."

Previous systematic reviews of interventions for alcohol use disorder (AUD) have not been specifically targeted at patients with cirrhosis or alcohol related hepatitis. This review addresses this evidence gap. Method:We followed the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews. Five databases were searched (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL and PSYCinfo) between inception of the database until November 2022. We included randomised trials and cohort studies which assessed the impact of an intervention to reduce alcohol intake with and without an active comparator. Only studies which included data specific to patients with cirrhosis or alcohol related hepatitis were included. We present a narrative synthesis of the results. Results: 23 studies were included in the final analysis. The study population was dominated by two, large, retrospective, database derived cohorts which included 101,745 patients with cirrhosis. The remaining 21 studies included 2574 patients, including 7 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 293 patients (Table 1). The most frequently assessed intervention was attendance at addiction therapy or alcohol rehabilitation (7 studies). Other interventions were pharmacological (baclofen, acamprosate, naltrexone, faecal transplant), psychological (motivational therapy, educational sessions) and attendance at specialist clinics. Two studies looked generically at the impact of any intervention for AUD. One retrospective cohort examined the impact of using low alcohol drinks. Studies variably reported outcomes related to liver disease (decompensation of cirrhosis, mortality and hospital admissions (n = 6)), alcohol use only (n = 10) or both outcome categories (n = 6). All of the studies which recorded alcohol outcomes reported that the intervention was beneficial in reducing intake or preventing relapse. In studies with control groups which reported on mortality, addiction treatment, attendance at outpatient clinics and (in a large database derived cohort) any AUD treatment had a statistically significant beneficial effect (p < 0.05). Three studies with control groups examined readmissions with only one finding a statistically significant reduction, this being associated with addiction therapy. Seven studies looked at new episodes of hepatic decompensation or change in MELD score. Of these, five of the interventions were found to have a statistically significant beneficial effect. Figure: RCTs in the review Conclusion: Interventions for alcohol use disorder can be effective in improving clinical outcomes of patients with cirrhosis and alcohol related hepatitis. The evidence base is dominated by large database derived cohorts and the interventions are not well defined, indicating the need for further research in this area. [Figure presented]"

"Novel Selective PPARα Modulator Pemafibrate for Dyslipidemia, Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), and Atherosclerosis †","Yamashita S., Rizzo M., Su T.-C., Masuda D.","Metabolites","10.3390/metabo13050626","13","5","2023","Statins, the intestinal cholesterol transporter inhibitor (ezetimibe), and PCSK9 inhibitors can reduce serum LDL-C levels, leading to a significant reduction in cardiovascular events. However, these events cannot be fully prevented even when maintaining very low LDL-C levels. Hypertriglyceridemia and reduced HDL-C are known as residual risk factors for ASCVD. Hypertriglyceridemia and/or low HDL-C can be treated with fibrates, nicotinic acids, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fibrates were demonstrated to be PPARα agonists and can markedly lower serum TG levels, yet were reported to cause some adverse effects, including an increase in the liver enzyme and creatinine levels. Recent megatrials of fibrates have shown negative findings on the prevention of ASCVD, which were supposed to be due to their low selectivity and potency for binding to PPAR α. To overcome the off-target effects of fibrates, the concept of a selective PPARα modulator (SPPARMα) was proposed. Kowa Company, Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), has developed pemafibrate (K-877). Compared with fenofibrate, pemafibrate showed more favorable effects on the reduction of TG and an increase in HDL-C. Fibrates worsened liver and kidney function test values, although pemafibrate showed a favorable effect on liver function test values and little effect on serum creatinine levels and eGFR. Minimal drug–drug interactions of pemafibrate with statins were observed. While most of the fibrates are mainly excreted from the kidney, pemafibrate is metabolized in the liver and excreted into the bile. It can be used safely even in patients with CKD, without a significant increase in blood concentration. In the megatrial of pemafibrate, PROMINENT, for dyslipidemic patients with type 2 diabetes, mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL-C and LDL-C levels, the incidence of cardiovascular events did not decrease among those receiving pemafibrate compared to those receiving the placebo; however, the incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was lower. Pemafibrate may be superior to conventional fibrates and applicable to CKD patients. This current review summarizes the recent findings on pemafibrate."
"Treatment Options for Hepatitis A and E: A Non-Systematic Review","Gabrielli F., Alberti F., Russo C., Cursaro C., Seferi H., Margotti M., Andreone P.","Viruses","10.3390/v15051080","15","5","2023","Hepatitis A and hepatitis E are relatively common causes of liver disease. Both viruses are mainly transmitted through the faecal–oral route and, consequently, most outbreaks occur in countries with poor sanitation. An important role of the immune response as the driver of liver injury is also shared by the two pathogens. For both the hepatitis A (HAV) and hepatitis E (HEV) viruses, the clinical manifestations of infection mainly consist of an acute disease with mild liver injury, which results in clinical and laboratory alterations that are self-limiting in most cases. However, severe acute disease or chronic, long-lasting manifestations may occur in vulnerable patients, such as pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals or those with pre-existing liver disease. Specifically, HAV infection rarely results in fulminant hepatitis, prolonged cholestasis, relapsing hepatitis and possibly autoimmune hepatitis triggered by the viral infection. Less common manifestations of HEV include extrahepatic disease, acute liver failure and chronic HEV infection with persistent viraemia. In this paper, we conduct a non-systematic review of the available literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of the state of the art. Treatment mainly consists of supportive measures, while the available evidence for aetiological treatment and additional agents in severe disease is limited in quantity and quality. However, several therapeutic approaches have been attempted: for HAV infection, corticosteroid therapy has shown outcome improvement, and molecules, such as AZD 1480, zinc chloride and heme oxygenase-1, have demonstrated a reduction in viral replication in vitro. As for HEV infection, therapeutic options mainly rely on the use of ribavirin, and some studies utilising pegylated interferon-alpha have shown conflicting results. While a vaccine for HAV is already available and has led to a significant reduction in the prevalence of the disease, several vaccines for HEV are currently being developed, with some already available in China, showing promising results."

Design: Narrative review. Data sources: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and Embase from inception to September 2022. The search was restricted to English and German language publications. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Randomized controlled trials, non-interventional studies, and meta-analyses assessing tannin and/or ethacridine for the treatment or prevention of diarrhea. Results: Of 366 titles identified, a total of 13 studies were included in this review. Five randomized controlled trials and four noninterventional trials demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the fixed combination of tannin albuminate and ethacridine lactate monohydrate in treating acute diarrhea and preventing traveler's diarrhea. The fixed combination reduced acute diarrhea duration by improving stool frequency, consistency, and weight and reduced the risk of traveler's diarrhea. Two pilot studies indicate efficacy in chronic diarrhea. Safety and tolerability were very good in all included studies. Two meta-analyses investigated the efficacy of gelatin tannate in children with acute gastroenteritis. Conclusion: The efficacy and safety of tannin albuminate and ethacridine lactate monohydrate for the treatment of acute diarrhea and the prevention of traveler's diarrhea are proven in randomized controlled trials. Several noninterventional studies substantiate the real-world effectiveness and tolerability of the fixed combination. Both active ingredients combine antidiarrheal, antimicrobial, mucosal protection, and spasmolytic properties. However, existing clinical data should be updated with larger, well-designed, placebo-controlled trials in adult and pediatric patient populations."

This systematic review identifies and summarises evidence from on-farm biosecurity and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions with the potential to directly or indirectly reduce infections and antibiotic resistance in animal agricultural settings. We searched 17 scientific databases (including Web of Science, PubMed, and regional databases) and grey literature from database inception to Dec 31, 2019 for articles that assessed biosecurity or WASH interventions measuring our outcomes of interest; namely, infection burden, microbial loads, antibiotic use, and antibiotic resistance in animals, humans, or the environment. Risk of bias was assessed with the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation tool, Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions, and the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies, although no studies were excluded as a result. Due to the heterogeneity of interventions found, we conducted a narrative synthesis. The protocol was pre-registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020162345). Of the 20 672 publications screened, 104 were included in this systematic review. 64 studies were conducted in high-income countries, 24 studies in upper-middle-income countries, 13 studies in lower-middle-income countries, two in low-income countries, and one included both upper-middle-income countries and lower-middle-income countries. 48 interventions focused on livestock (mainly pigs), 43 poultry (mainly chickens), one on livestock and poultry, and 12 on aquaculture farms. 68 of 104 interventions took place on intensive farms, 22 in experimental settings, and ten in smallholder or subsistence farms. Positive outcomes were reported for ten of 23 water studies, 17 of 35 hygiene studies, 15 of 24 sanitation studies, all three air-quality studies, and 11 of 17 other biosecurity-related interventions. In total, 18 of 26 studies reported reduced infection or diseases, 37 of 71 studies reported reduced microbial loads, four of five studies reported reduced antibiotic use, and seven of 20 studies reported reduced antibiotic resistance. Overall, risk of bias was high in 28 of 57 studies with positive interventions and 17 of 30 studies with negative or neutral interventions. Farm-management interventions successfully reduced antibiotic use by up to 57%. Manure-oriented interventions reduced antibiotic resistance genes or antibiotic-resistant bacteria in animal waste by up to 99%. This systematic review highlights the challenges of preventing and controlling infections and antimicrobial resistance, even in well resourced agricultural settings. Most of the evidence emerges from studies that focus on the farm itself, rather than targeting agricultural communities or the broader social, economic, and policy environment that could affect their outcomes. WASH and biosecurity interventions could complement each other when addressing antimicrobial resistance in the human, animal, and environmental interface."
"Fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile (Clostridium difficile)","Minkoff N.Z., Aslam S., Medina M., Tanner-Smith E.E., Zackular J.P., Acra S., Nicholson M.R., Imdad A.","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","10.1002/14651858.CD013871.pub2","2023","4","2023","Background: Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) is a bacterium that can cause potentially life-threatening diarrheal illness in individuals with an unhealthy mixture of gut bacteria, known as dysbiosis, and can cause recurrent infections in nearly a third of infected individuals. The traditional treatment of recurrent C difficile infection (rCDI) includes antibiotics, which may further exacerbate dysbiosis. There is growing interest in correcting the underlying dysbiosis in rCDI using of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT); and there is a need to establish the benefits and harms of FMT for the treatment of rCDI based on data from randomized controlled trials. Objectives: To evaluate the benefits and harms of donor-based fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in immunocompetent people. Search methods: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 31 March 2022. Selection criteria: We considered randomized trials of adults or children with rCDI for inclusion. Eligible interventions must have met the definition of FMT, which is the administration of fecal material containing distal gut microbiota from a healthy donor to the gastrointestinal tract of a person with rCDI. The comparison group included participants who did not receive FMT and were given placebo, autologous FMT, no intervention, or antibiotics with activity against C difficile. Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. proportion of participants with resolution of rCDI and 2. serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 3. treatment failure, 4. all-cause mortality, 5. withdrawal from study, 6. rate of new CDI infection after a successful FMT, 7. any adverse event, 8. quality of life, and 9. colectomy. We used the GRADE criteria to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. Main results: We included six studies with 320 participants. Two studies were conducted in Denmark, and one each in the Netherlands, Canada, Italy, and the US. Four were single-center and two were multicenter studies. All studies included only adults. Five studies excluded people who were severely immunocompromised, with only one study including 10 participants who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy out of the 64 enrolled; these were similarly distributed between the FMT arm (4/24 or 17%) and comparison arms (6/40 or 15%). The route of administration was the upper gastrointestinal tract via a nasoduodenal tube in one study, two studies used enema only, two used colonoscopic only delivery, and one used either nasojejunal or colonoscopic delivery, depending on a clinical determination of whether the recipient could tolerate a colonoscopy. Five studies had at least one comparison group that received vancomycin. The risk of bias (RoB 2) assessments did not find an overall high risk of bias for any outcome. All six studies assessed the efficacy and safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Pooled results from six studies showed that the use of FMT in immunocompetent participants with rCDI likely leads to a large increase in resolution of rCDI in the FMT group compared to control (risk ratio (RR) 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.71; P = 0.02, I(2) = 63%; 6 studies, 320 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3; moderate-certainty evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation probably results in a slight reduction in serious adverse events; however, the CIs around the summary estimate were wide (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.41; P = 0.24, I² = 26%; 6 studies, 320 participants; NNTB 12; moderate-certainty evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation may result in a reduction in all-cause mortality; however, the number of events was small, and the CIs of the summary estimate were wide (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.45; P = 0.48, I(2) = 0%; 6 studies, 320 participants; NNTB 20; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported colectomy rates. Authors' conclusions: In immunocompetent adults with rCDI, FMT likely leads to a large increase in the resolution of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection compared to alternative treatments such as antibiotics. There was no conclusive evidence regarding the safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI as the number of events was small for serious adverse events and all-cause mortality. Additional data from large national registry databases might be required to assess any short-term or long-term risks with using FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Elimination of the single study that included some immunocompromised people did not alter these conclusions. Due to the low number of immunocompromised participants enrolled, conclusions cannot be drawn about the risks or benefits of FMT for rCDI in the immunocompromised population."
"The potential of tailoring the gut microbiome to prevent and treat cardiometabolic disease","Chakaroun R.M., Olsson L.M., Bäckhed F.","Nature Reviews Cardiology","10.1038/s41569-022-00771-0","20","4","2023","Despite milestones in preventive measures and treatment, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains associated with a high burden of morbidity and mortality. The protracted nature of the development and progression of CVD motivates the identification of early and complementary targets that might explain and alleviate any residual risk in treated patients. The gut microbiota has emerged as a sentinel between our inner milieu and outer environment and relays a modified risk associated with these factors to the host. Accordingly, numerous mechanistic studies in animal models support a causal role of the gut microbiome in CVD via specific microbial or shared microbiota–host metabolites and have identified converging mammalian targets for these signals. Similarly, large-scale cohort studies have repeatedly reported perturbations of the gut microbial community in CVD, supporting the translational potential of targeting this ecological niche, but the move from bench to bedside has not been smooth. In this Review, we provide an overview of the current evidence on the interconnectedness of the gut microbiome and CVD against the noisy backdrop of highly prevalent confounders in advanced CVD, such as increased metabolic burden and polypharmacy. We further aim to conceptualize the molecular mechanisms at the centre of these associations and identify actionable gut microbiome-based targets, while contextualizing the current knowledge within the clinical scenario and emphasizing the limitations of the field that need to be overcome."
"The Effects of Cardioprotective Antidiabetic Therapy on Microbiota in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus—A Systematic Review","Bica I.-C., Pietroșel V.-A., Salmen T., Diaconu C.-T., Fierbinteanu Braticevici C., Stoica R.-A., Suceveanu A.I., Pantea Stoian A.","International Journal of Molecular Sciences","10.3390/ijms24087184","24","8","2023","As the pathophysiologic mechanisms of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are discovered, there is a switch from glucocentric to a more comprehensive, patient-centered management. The holistic approach considers the interlink between T2DM and its complications, finding the best therapies for minimizing the cardiovascular (CV) or renal risk and benefitting from the treatment‘s pleiotropic effects. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) fit best in the holistic approach because of their effects in reducing the risk of CV events and obtaining better metabolic control. Additionally, research on the SGLT-2i and GLP-1 RA modification of gut microbiota is accumulating. The microbiota plays a significant role in the relation between diet and CV disease because some intestinal bacteria lead to an increase in short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and consequent positive effects. Thus, our review aims to describe the relation between antidiabetic non-insulin therapy (SGLT-2i and GLP-1 RA) with CV-proven benefits and the gut microbiota in patients with T2DM. We identified five randomized clinical trials including dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, liraglutide, and loxenatide, with different results. There were differences between empagliflozin and metformin regarding the effects on microbiota despite similar glucose control in both study groups. One study demonstrated that liraglutide induced gut microbiota alterations in patients with T2DM treated initially with metformin, but another failed to detect any differences when the same molecule was compared with sitagliptin. The established CV and renal protection that the SGLT-2i and GLP-1 RA exert could be partly due to their action on gut microbiota. The individual and cumulative effects of antidiabetic drugs on gut microbiota need further research."
"The Microbiome and Antimicrobial Stewardship in Surgical Patients","Creel J.P., Maves R.C.","Surgical Infections","10.1089/sur.2022.422","24","3","2023","The human microbiome plays a critical role in health and disease. The microbiota of the human body undergoes disruptions in critical illness, in part due to alterations in physiology but also as the result of medical interventions, most notably antimicrobial drug administration. These alterations may lead to a significant dysbiosis, with increased risks of multi-drug-resistant organism-based secondary infections, Clostridioides difficile promotion, and other infection-related complications. Antimicrobial stewardship is a process that seeks to optimize antimicrobial drug prescription, with recent evidence emphasizing shorter courses of therapy, earlier transitions from empiric to pathogen-specific regimens, and enhanced diagnostic testing. Through a combination of prudent stewardship and wise use of diagnostic testing, clinicians can improve outcomes, reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance, and help improve the integrity of the microbiome."
"Impact on childhood mortality of interventions to improve drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) to households: Systematic review and meta-analysis","Waddington H.S., Masset E., Bick S., Cairncross S.","PLoS Medicine","10.1371/journal.pmed.1004215","20","4","2023","Background In low- and middle-income countries (L&MICs), the biggest contributing factors to the global burden of disease in childhood are deaths due to respiratory illness and diarrhoea, both of which are closely related to use of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services by households. However, current estimates of the health impacts of WASH interventions use self-reported morbidity, which may fail to capture longer-term or more severe impacts. Reported mortality is thought to be less prone to bias than other reported measures. This study aimed to answer the question: What are the impacts of WASH interventions on reported childhood mortality in L&MICs? Methods and findings We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, using a published protocol. Systematic searches of 11 academic databases and trial registries, plus organisational repositories, were undertaken to locate studies of WASH interventions, which were published in peer review journals or other sources (e.g., organisational reports and working papers). Intervention studies of WASH improvements implemented under endemic disease circumstances in L&MICs were eligible, which reported findings at any time until March 2020. We used the participant flow data supplied in response to journal editors' calls for greater transparency. Data were collected by two authors working independently. We included evidence from 24 randomized and 11 nonrandomized studies of WASH interventions from all global regions, incorporating 2, 600 deaths. Effects of 48 WASH treatment arms were included in analysis. We critically appraised and synthesised evidence using meta-analysis to improve statistical power. We found WASH interventions are associated with a significant reduction of 17% in the odds of all-cause mortality in childhood (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.74, 0.92, evidence from 38 interventions), and a significant reduction in diarrhoea mortality of 45% (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.35, 0.84; 10 interventions). Further analysis by WASH technology indicated interventions providing improved water in quantity to households were most consistently associated with reductions in all-cause mortality. Community-wide sanitation was most consistently associated with reductions in diarrhoea mortality. Around one-half of the included studies were assessed as being at “moderate risk of bias” in attributing mortality in childhood to the WASH intervention, and no studies were found to be at “low risk of bias.” The review should be updated to incorporate additional published and unpublished participant flow data. Conclusions The findings are congruent with theories of infectious disease transmission. Washing with water presents a barrier to respiratory illness and diarrhoea, which are the two biggest contributors to all-cause mortality in childhood in L&MICs. Community-wide sanitation halts the spread of diarrhoea. We observed that evidence synthesis can provide new findings, going beyond the underlying data from trials to generate crucial insights for policy. Transparent reporting in trials creates opportunities for research synthesis to answer questions about mortality, which individual studies of interventions cannot be reliably designed to address."

However, little is known about how improved WASH practices and behaviors and OCV interact to reduce the risk of cholera. We reanalyzed two arms of a cluster-randomized trial in urban Bangladesh, to evaluate the effectiveness of OCV given as a 2-dose regimen. One arm (30 clusters, n = 94,675) was randomized to vaccination of persons aged one year and older with OCV, and the other arm (30 clusters, n = 80,056) to no intervention. We evaluated the prevention of cholera by household WASH, classified at baseline using a previously validated rule, and OCV over 2 years of follow-up. When analyzed by assignment to OCV clusters rather than receipt of OCV, in comparison to persons living in “Not Better WASH” households in the control clusters, reduction of severe cholera (the primary outcome) was similar for persons in “Not Better WASH” households in vaccine clusters (46%, 95% CI:24,62), for persons in “Better WASH” households in the control clusters (48%, 95% CI:25,64), and for persons in “Better WASH” households in the vaccine clusters (48%, 95% CI:16,67). In contrast, when analyzed by actual receipt of a complete OCV regimen, in comparison to persons in “Not Better WASH” households in the control clusters, protection against severe cholera increased steadily from 39% (95% CI:13,58) in residents of “Better WASH” households in the control clusters to 57% (95% CI:35,72) in vaccinated persons in “Not Better WASH” households to 63% (95% CI:21,83) in vaccinated persons in “Better WASH” households. This analysis suggests that improved household WASH and OCV received may interact to provide greater protection against cholera. However, the divergence between findings related to intent to vaccinate versus those pertaining to actual receipt of OCV underscores the need for further research on this topic."

The evidence from systematic reviews, however, is limited. Objective: Evidence from randomized controlled trials testing oral consumption of fermented-milk kefir on any outcome of human health or disease. Data Sources: A systematic search of 4 electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and Cochrane Trials) from inception to July 31, 2021, was conducted. Data Extraction: Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessments were conducted by 2 reviewers independently. Data Analysis: A total of 18 publications reporting the results of 16 studies were included. Per the narrative analysis, fermented-milk kefir may have potential as a complementary therapy in reducing oral Streptococcus mutans, thereby reducing dental caries risk, and in Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. Kefir may further aid treatment of adult dyslipidemia and hypertension, although evidence was very limited. Safety was only assessed in 5 of the 18 included publications, and 12 of the studies had an overall high risk for bias. Conclusion: Kefir is a dairy product with a unique microbiological profile that appears to be a safe for generally healthy populations to consume. However, efficacy and safety data from high-quality human trials are essential before any recommendations may be made for conditions of the oral and gastric microbiota and metabolic health."

However, findings are conflicting. In the present systematic review, we aimed to summarize the effects of berberine on gut microbiota in the models of metabolic disorders in both animal studies and clinical trials. Publications in five electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched systematically up to 31 May 2021 to find relevant articles with English language. Out of 4102 studies (including 2125 duplicates), 35 studies were included. In animal studies, various effects of berberine on beneficial and harmful microbiota were reported. However, findings also indicated that berberine can decrease the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio. Three out of five studies showed positive effects of berberine on the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), particularly butyrate. In three animal studies, lipopolysacaride (LPS) concentrations decreased with berberine administration. In clinical trials (n=3) positive effects on microbiota and metabolic status were also reported. However, the quality of clinical trials was mainly low. The present systematic review showed that berberine can modulate key metabolic parameters through improving the balance of intestinal microbiome, decreasing the abundance of harmful microbiota and LPS concentrations, and increasing the production of SCFAs, particularly butyrate in animal models. However, there are limited high-quality evidence regarding the effects of berberine on gut flora in clinical trials. Although berberine can be an effective prebiotic supplement to modulate metabolic parameters, further high-quality clinical trials are needed to confirm this potential."
"Preoperative combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation for preventing complications in elective colorectal surgery","Willis M.A., Toews I., Soltau S.L.V., Kalff J.C., Meerpohl J.J., Vilz T.O.","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","10.1002/14651858.CD014909.pub2","2023","2","2023","Background: The success of elective colorectal surgery is mainly influenced by the surgical procedure and postoperative complications. The most serious complications include anastomotic leakages and surgical site infections (SSI)s, which can lead to prolonged recovery with impaired long-term health. Compared with other abdominal procedures, colorectal resections have an increased risk of adverse events due to the physiological bacterial colonisation of the large bowel. Preoperative bowel preparation is used to remove faeces from the bowel lumen and reduce bacterial colonisation. This bowel preparation can be performed mechanically and/or with oral antibiotics. While mechanical bowel preparation alone is not beneficial, the benefits and harms of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation is still unclear. Objectives: To assess the evidence for the use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation for preventing complications in elective colorectal surgery. Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL and trial registries on 15 December 2021. In addition, we searched reference lists and contacted colorectal surgery organisations. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adult participants undergoing elective colorectal surgery comparing combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation (MBP+oAB) with either MBP alone, oAB alone, or no bowel preparation (nBP). We excluded studies in which no perioperative intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis was given. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. Pooled results were reported as mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) using the Mantel-Haenszel method. The certainty of the evidence was assessed with GRADE. Main results: We included 21 RCTs analysing 5264 participants who underwent elective colorectal surgery. None of the included studies had a high risk of bias, but two-thirds of the included studies raised some concerns. This was mainly due to the lack of a predefined analysis plan or missing information about the randomisation process. Most included studies investigated both colon and rectal resections due to malignant and benign surgical indications. For MBP as well as oAB, the included studies used different regimens in terms of agent(s), dosage and timing. Data for all predefined outcomes could be extracted from the included studies. However, only four studies reported on side effects of bowel preparation, and none recorded the occurrence of adverse effects such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances or the need to discontinue the intervention due to side effects. Seventeen trials compared MBP+oAB with sole MBP.The incidence of SSI could be reduced through MBP+oAB by 44% (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.74; 3917 participants from 16 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and the risk of anastomotic leakage could be reduced by 40% (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.99; 2356 participants from 10 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). No difference between the two comparison groups was found with regard to mortality (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.82; 639 participants from 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), the incidence of postoperative ileus (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.32; 2013 participants from 6 studies, low-certainty of evidence) and length of hospital stay (MD -0.19, 95% CI -1.81 to 1.44; 621 participants from 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Three trials compared MBP+oAB with sole oAB.No difference was demonstrated between the two treatment alternatives in terms of SSI (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.21; 960 participants from 3 studies; very low-certainty evidence), anastomotic leakage (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.45; 960 participants from 3 studies; low-certainty evidence), mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.50; 709 participants from 2 studies; low-certainty evidence), incidence of postoperative ileus (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.33; 709 participants from 2 studies; low-certainty evidence) or length of hospital stay (MD 0.1 respectively 0.2, 95% CI -0.68 to 1.08; data from 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial (396 participants) compared MBP+oAB versus nBP. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of MBP+oAB on the incidence of SSI as well as mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.23 respectively RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.22; low-certainty evidence), while no effect on the risk of anastomotic leakages (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.42; low-certainty evidence), the incidence of postoperative ileus (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.81; low-certainty evidence) or the length of hospital stay (MD 0.1, 95% CI -0.8 to 1; low-certainty evidence) could be demonstrated. Authors' conclusions: Based on moderate-certainty evidence, our results suggest that MBP+oAB is probably more effective than MBP alone in preventing postoperative complications. In particular, with respect to our primary outcomes, SSI and anastomotic leakage, a lower incidence was demonstrated using MBP+oAB. Whether oAB alone is actually equivalent to MBP+oAB, or leads to a reduction or increase in the risk of postoperative complications, cannot be clarified in light of the low- to very low-certainty evidence. Similarly, it remains unclear whether omitting preoperative bowel preparation leads to an increase in the risk of postoperative complications due to limited evidence. Additional RCTs, particularly on the comparisons of MBP+oAB versus oAB alone or nBP, are needed to assess the impact of oAB alone or nBP compared with MBP+oAB on postoperative complications and to improve confidence in the estimated effect. In addition, RCTs focusing on subgroups (e.g. in relation to type and location of colon resections) or reporting side effects of the intervention are needed to determine the most effective approach of preoperative bowel preparation."

Methods: We searched multiple electronic databases for all publications to 12th October 2020, and RCTs only to 28th June 2021. Two reviewers screened, extracted, and analysed data. We used Cochrane ROB (Risk of Bias)1 for RCTs, ROBINS-I for non-RCTs, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Results: Data from 30 RCTs and 2 non-RCTs showed no overall difference between groups for all-cause mortality and adverse events in four comparisons. Certainty of the evidence was downgraded for high ROB and imprecision. (1) CP versus standard care (SoC) (20 RCTS, 2 non-RCTs, very-low to moderate-high certainty); (2) CP versus biologically active control (6 RCTs, very-low certainty); (3) hIVIG versus SoC (3 RCTs, very-low certainty); (4) early CP versus deferred CP (1 RCT, very-low certainty). Subgrouping by titre improved precision in one outcome (30-day mortality) for the ‘COVID high-titre’ category in Comparison 1 (no difference, high certainty) and Comparison 2 (favours CP, very-low certainty). Post hoc analysis suggests a possible benefit of CP in patients testing negative for antibodies at baseline, compared with those testing positive. Conclusion: A minimum titre should be established and ensured for a positive biological response to the therapy. Further research on the impact of CP/hIVIG in patients who have not yet produced antibodies to the virus would be useful to target therapies at groups who will potentially benefit the most."

Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted up to April 23, 2021, using linezolid and its synonyms as search terms. Two reviewers independently identified and extracted relevant randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies. The extracted studies were included in a single-rate meta-analysis of adverse events and clinical outcomes using random-effects models. Results: A total of 1082 articles were identified, and nine studies involving 758 children were included in the meta-analysis. The overall proportion of adverse events was 8.91% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.64%–36.52%], with diarrhea (2.24%), vomiting (2.05%), and rash (1.72%) being the most common. The incidences of thrombocytopenia and anemia were 0.68% and 0.16%, respectively. Some specific adverse events, including rash and gastrointestinal events, were more frequent in the oral administration subgroup. In terms of efficacy, the overall proportion of clinical improvement was 88.80% (95% CI = 81.31%–93.52%). Children with a history of specific bacteriological diagnosis or concomitant antibiotic therapy had a 1.13-fold higher clinical improvement than children without such histories. The proportion of microbial eradication was 92.68% (95% CI = 84.66%–96.68%). The proportion of all-cause mortality was 0.16% (95% CI = 0.00%–7.75%). Conclusions: Linezolid was well-tolerated in pediatric patients and was associated with a low frequency of adverse events, such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Moreover, linezolid was effective in children with diagnosed and suspected Gram-positive infections."

Clinical studies and experimental data suggest a causal relationship, making the gut microbiome an attractive therapeutic goal. Fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) is a method to alter a person’s microbiome composition. Although this method allowed for the establishment of proof of concept for using microbiome modulation to treat metabolic disorders, the method is not yet ready for broad application. It is a resource-intensive method that also carries some procedural risks and whose effects are not always reproducible. This review summarizes the current knowledge on FMT to treat metabolic diseases and gives an outlook on open research questions. Further research is undoubtedly required to find applications that are less resource-intensive, such as oral encapsulated formulations, and have strong and predictable results. Furthermore, a clear commitment from all stakeholders is necessary to move forward in the direction of developing live microbial agents, next-generation probiotics, and targeted dietary interventions."
"Immunotherapy in Melanoma: Recent Advances and Future Directions","Knight A., Karapetyan L., Kirkwood J.M.","Cancers","10.3390/cancers15041106","15","4","2023","The use of immunotherapy in the treatment of advanced and high-risk melanoma has led to a striking improvement in outcomes. Although the incidence of melanoma has continued to rise, median survival has improved from approximately 6 months to nearly 6 years for patients with advanced inoperable stage IV disease. Recent understanding of the tumor microenvironment and its interplay with the immune system has led to the explosive development of novel immunotherapy treatments. Since the approval of the therapeutic cytokines interleukin-2 and interferon alfa-2 in the 1990s, the development of novel immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), oncolytic virus therapy, and modulators of the tumor microenvironment have given way to a new era in melanoma treatment. Monoclonal antibodies directed at programmed cell death protein 1 receptor (PD-1) and its ligand (PDL-1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) have provided robust activation of the adaptive immune system, restoring immune surveillance leading to host tumor recognition and destruction. Multiple other immunomodulatory therapeutics are under investigation to overcome resistance to ICI therapy, including the toll-like receptor-9 (TLR-9) and 7/8 (TLR-7/8) agonists, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists, and fecal microbiota transplantation. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in immunotherapy for the treatment of melanoma and provide an update on novel therapies currently under investigation."

Patients with alcohol-associated liver disease are often diagnosed at advanced stage and disease spectrumincluding alcoholic hepatitis, a severe manifestation with a high short-term mortality. Corticosteroid, recommended first-line treatment for patients with alcoholic hepatitis, is a very suboptimal treatment. Although the use of early liver transplantation has increased with consistent benefit in select patients with alcoholic hepatitis, its use remains heterogeneous worldwide due to lack of uniform selection criteria. Over the last decade, several therapeutic targets have evolved of promise with ongoing clinical trials in patients with cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis. Even with availability of effective medical therapies for alcohol-associated liver disease, long-term outcome depends on abstinence from alcohol use in any spectrum of alcohol-associated liver disease. However, alcohol use disorder treatment remains underutilized due to several barriers even in patients with advanced disease. There is an urgent unmet need to implement and promote integratedmultidisciplinary care model with hepatologists and addiction experts to provide comprehensive management for these patients. In this review, we will discuss newer therapies targeting liver disease and therapies targeting alcohol use disorder in patients with alcohol-associated liver disease."

The available evidence on diagnosis, pathophysiology and risk factors, prevention and treatment of POR was reviewed and unanswered research questions were listed Results: In recent years, surgeons have been utilising innovative surgical techniques to reduce POR. Whilst the side-to-side anastomosis has become more common, the benefits of newer procedures such as Kono-S anastomosis or over-the-valve strictureplasty remain unproven Consistency in describing and reporting POR is crucial both in routine practice and in clinical research. Ileocolonoscopy six to twelve months after ileocolonic anastomosis remains the gold standard to diagnose POR However, an effort to adapt the Rutgeerts score to surgical techniques different from end-to-end anastomosis is required. Significance of isolated ulcers of the anastomotic line, specifically in case of stapled anastomoses, is still debated. In the coming years, intestinal ultrasound combined to faecal calprotectin may ultimately decrease the reliance on ileocolonoscopy Research on the microbiome and genetic background of patients with POR is promising although not applicable in daily clinical practice yet Smoking is the only risk factor clearly identified in POR, whereas previous ileocolonic resection or penetrating disease have not been validated in prospective studies. Stronger emphasis on smoking cessation for all patients should include specific active measures to make it successful The prevailing gap in accurate predictors of POR disempowers clinicians from stratifying between systematic prophylaxis and endoscopy-driven approach. Immediate prophylaxis therapy may lead to overtreatment Ongoing randomized controlled trials comparing (i) systematic prophylaxis and endoscopy-guided introduction of biological therapy (NCT05169593), and (ii) therapy escalation to status quo in patients with moderate endoscopic POR (NCT05072782) should be informative Conclusion: Despite important progress in the field of POR in the last 30 years, POR management remains a challenge. The IBD community should strive to optimise diagnostic procedures of POR including ileocolonoscopy and non-invasive techniques, define patients at high risk of POR using microbiome and/or genetic profiling and clarify the optimal medical treatment strategy after surgery."
"Impact of multidrug resistance on the management of bacterial infections in cirrhosis","Terra C., de Mattos Â.Z., Chagas M.S., Torres A., Wiltgen D., Souza B.M., Perez R.M.","World Journal of Clinical Cases","10.12998/wjcc.v11.i3.534","11","3","2023","Patients with cirrhosis have an increased risk of infection and differently from other complications, that over the years are improving in their outcomes, infections in cirrhotic patients are still a major cause of hospitalization and death (up to 50% in-hospital mortality). Infections by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) have become a major challenge in the management of cirrhotic patients with significant prognostic and cost-related impact. About one third of cirrhotic patients with bacterial infections is infected with MDR bacteria and their prevalence has increased in recent years. MDR infections have a worse prognosis compared to infections by non-resistant bacteria because they are associated with lower rate of infection resolution. An adequate management of cirrhotic patients with infections caused by MDR bacteria depends on the knowledge of some epidemiological aspects, such as the type of infection (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection and spontaneous bacteremia), bacteriological profile of antibiotic resistance at each health care unit and site of infection acquisition (community acquired, healthcare associated or nosocomial). Furthermore, regional variations in the prevalence of MDR infections determine that the choice of empirical antibiotic therapy must be adapted to the local microbiological epidemiology. Antibiotic treatment is the most effective measure to treat infections caused by MDRO. Therefore, optimizing antibiotic prescribing is critical to effectively treat these infections. Identification of risk factors for multidrug resistance is essential to define the best antibiotic treatment strategy in each case and the choice of an effective empirical antibiotic therapy and its early administration is cardinal to reduce mortality. On the other hand, the supply of new agents to treat these infections is very limited. Thus, specific protocols that include preventive measures must be implemented in order to limit the negative impact of this severe complication in cirrhotic patients."
"Interventions to improve sanitation for preventing diarrhoea","Bauza V., Ye W., Liao J., Majorin F., Clasen T.","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","10.1002/14651858.CD013328.pub2","2023","1","2023","Background: Diarrhoea is a major contributor to the global disease burden, particularly amongst children under five years in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). As many of the infectious agents associated with diarrhoea are transmitted through faeces, sanitation interventions to safely contain and manage human faeces have the potential to reduce exposure and diarrhoeal disease. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of sanitation interventions for preventing diarrhoeal disease, alone or in combination with other WASH interventions. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Chinese language databases available under the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI-CAJ). We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and conference proceedings, contacted researchers, and searched references of included studies. The last search date was 16 February 2022. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs), and matched cohort studies of interventions aimed at introducing or expanding the coverage and/or use of sanitation facilities in children and adults in any country or population. Our primary outcome of interest was diarrhoea and secondary outcomes included dysentery (bloody diarrhoea), persistent diarrhoea, hospital or clinical visits for diarrhoea, mortality, and adverse events. We included sanitation interventions whether they were conducted independently or in combination with other interventions. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed eligible studies, extracted relevant data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used meta-analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect, described results narratively, and investigated potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses. Main results: Fifty-one studies met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 238,535 participants. Of these, 50 studies had sufficient information to be included in quantitative meta-analysis, including 17 cluster-RCTs and 33 studies with non-randomized study designs (20 NRCTs, one CBA, and 12 matched cohort studies). Most were conducted in LMICs and 86% were conducted in whole or part in rural areas. Studies covered three broad types of interventions: (1) providing access to any sanitation facility to participants without existing access practising open defecation, (2) improving participants' existing sanitation facility, or (3) behaviour change messaging to improve sanitation access or practices without providing hardware or subsidy, although many studies overlapped multiple categories. There was substantial heterogeneity amongst individual study results for all types of interventions. Providing access to any sanitation facility. Providing access to sanitation facilities was evaluated in seven cluster-RCTs, and may reduce diarrhoea prevalence in all age groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.08; 7 trials, 40,129 participants, low-certainty evidence). In children under five years, access may have little or no effect on diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16, 4 trials, 16,215 participants, low-certainty evidence). Additional analysis in non-randomized studies was generally consistent with these findings. Pooled estimates across randomized and non-randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94; 15 studies, 73,511 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02; 11 studies, 25,614 participants). Sanitation facility improvement. Interventions designed to improve existing sanitation facilities were evaluated in three cluster-RCTs in children under five and may reduce diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.06; 3 trials, 14,900 participants, low-certainty evidence). However, some of these interventions, such as sewerage connection, are not easily randomized. Non-randomized studies across participants of all ages provided estimates that improving sanitation facilities may reduce diarrhoea, but may be subject to confounding (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.74; 23 studies, 117,639 participants, low-certainty evidence). Pooled estimates across randomized and non-randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.78; 26 studies, 132,539 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.91, 12 studies, 23,353 participants). Behaviour change messaging only (no hardware or subsidy provided). Strategies to promote behaviour change to construct, upgrade, or use sanitation facilities were evaluated in seven cluster-RCTs in children under five, and probably reduce diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; 7 studies, 28,909 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Additional analysis from two non-randomized studies found no effect, though with very high uncertainty. Pooled estimates across randomized and non-randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; 9 studies, 31,080 participants). No studies measured the effects of this type of intervention in older populations. Any sanitation intervention. A pooled analysis of cluster-RCTs across all sanitation interventions demonstrated that the interventions may reduce diarrhoea prevalence in all ages (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95, 17 trials, 83,938 participants, low-certainty evidence) and children under five (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97; 14 trials, 60,024 participants, low-certainty evidence). Non-randomized comparisons also demonstrated a protective effect, but may be subject to confounding. Pooled estimates across randomized and non-randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.82; 50 studies, 237,130 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89; 32 studies, 80,047 participants). In subgroup analysis, there was some evidence of larger effects in studies with increased coverage amongst all participants (75% or higher coverage levels) and also some evidence that the effect decreased over longer follow-up times for children under five years. There was limited evidence on other outcomes. However, there was some evidence that any sanitation intervention was protective against dysentery (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.00; 5 studies, 34,025 participants) and persistent diarrhoea (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.75; 2 studies, 2665 participants), but not against clinic visits for diarrhoea (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.67; 2 studies, 3720 participants) or all-cause mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89 to1.09; 7 studies, 46,123 participants). Authors' conclusions: There is evidence that sanitation interventions are effective at preventing diarrhoea, both for young children and all age populations. The actual level of effectiveness, however, varies by type of intervention and setting. There is a need for research to better understand the factors that influence effectiveness."
"Past, current, and potential treatments for cryptosporidiosis in humans and farm animals: A comprehensive review","Khan S.M., Witola W.H.","Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology","10.3389/fcimb.2023.1115522","13",NA,"2023","The intracellular protozoan parasite of the genus Cryptosporidium is among the leading causes of waterborne diarrheal disease outbreaks throughout the world. The parasite is transmitted by ingestion of infective oocysts that are highly stable in the environment and resistant to almost all conventional disinfection methods and water treatments. Control of the parasite infection is exceedingly difficult due to the excretion of large numbers of oocysts in the feces of infected individuals that contaminate the environment and serve as a source of infection for susceptible hosts including humans and animals. Drug development against the parasite is challenging owing to its limited genetic tractability, absence of conventional drug targets, unique intracellular location within the host, and the paucity of robust cell culture platforms for continuous parasite propagation. Despite the high prevalence of the parasite, the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment of Cryptosporidium infections is nitazoxanide, which has shown moderate efficacy in immunocompetent patients. More importantly, no effective therapeutic drugs are available for treating severe, potentially life-threatening cryptosporidiosis in immunodeficient patients, young children, and neonatal livestock. Thus, safe, inexpensive, and efficacious drugs are urgently required to reduce the ever-increasing global cryptosporidiosis burden especially in low-resource countries. Several compounds have been tested for both in vitro and in vivo efficacy against the disease. However, to date, only a few experimental compounds have been subjected to clinical trials in natural hosts, and among those none have proven efficacious. This review provides an overview of the past and present anti-Cryptosporidium pharmacotherapy in humans and agricultural animals. Herein, we also highlight the progress made in the field over the last few years and discuss the different strategies employed for discovery and development of effective prospective treatments for cryptosporidiosis."

Treatment is complex, since antibiotics constitute both the main treatment and the major risk factor for infection. Worryingly, resistance to multiple antibiotics is becoming increasingly widespread, leading to the classification of this pathogen as an urgent threat to global health. As a consummate opportunist, C. difficile is well equipped for promoting disease, owing to its arsenal of virulence factors: transmission of this anaerobe is highly efficient due to the formation of robust endospores, and an array of adhesins promote gut colonization. C. difficile produces multiple toxins acting upon gut epithelia, resulting in manifestations typical of diarrheal disease, and severe inflammation in a subset of patients. This review focuses on such virulence factors, as well as the importance of antimicrobial resistance and genome plasticity in enabling pathogenesis and persistence of this important pathogen."

This systematic review summarizes the role of buckwheat in modifying GI health outcomes and microbiomes. Methods: Four medical databases and Google Scholar were systematically searched. Clinical trials, observational studies, animal in vivo, and in vitro studies with human and animal GI-derived samples were included. Results: There were 32 studies (one randomized controlled trial [RCT], one non-randomized trial, 3 observational, 9 in vitro, and 18 animal in vivo studies) included. In preclinical studies, buckwheat extracts were observed to have cytotoxic potential against human-derived GI cancer cell lines. Animals fed with buckwheat had lower GI mucosal inflammation, higher alpha diversity in the GI microbiome, and higher levels of fecal short-chain fatty acids. Human evidence studies and clinical trials were limited and predominantly of moderate risk of bias. The majority of in vitro studies with GI-derived samples and in vivo studies were reliable without restrictions in study design. Conclusion: In vivo and in vitro studies show that buckwheat may have potential GI benefits due to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potential; however, human evidence remains limited, and its impact on health in humans remains to be elucidated in future trials."

It is necessary to assess the efficacy and safety of OS preparations in the adjunctive treatment of DKD by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. Objective: Ophiocordyceps sinensis preparations were evaluated for their efficacy and safety as adjunctive therapy to conventional drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)) for DKD. Methods: We searched seven electronic literature databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ACEI/ARB and OS combined with ACEI/ARB from inception up to March 2022. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias independently. Evidence certainty was rated using the GRADE system. Standardized mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) was pooled with random effects models and was reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis and Egger's test were performed using R software (version 14.2) (PROSPERO registration no. CRD42021248634). Results: Thirty eight RCTs involving 3167 patients met the inclusion criteria. No trials were reported with outcomes about kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events. In meta-analysis, compared with the control group of ACEI/ARB alone, OS combined with ACEI/ARB can achieve better effects in the treatment of DKD on reducing serum creatinine (Scr) [MD(Scr) =-11.48 95% CI [-15.78, -7.18], p < 0.01], blood urea nitrogen (BUN) [MD(BUN)= -1.00, 95% CI [-1.44, -0.55], p < 0.01], β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) [SMD(β2)(−)(MG)= -1.32, 95% CI [-2.27, -0.37], p < 0.01], cystatin C (CysC) [MD(CysC)=-0.64, 95% CI [-0.83, -0.45], p < 0.01], 24-h urine proteinuria (24hUP) [SMD(24hUP)= -1.99, 95% CI [-2.68; -1.31], p < 0.01], urine microalbumin (UALB) [MD(UALB)= -37.41, 95% CI [-44.76, -30.06], p < 0.01] and decreasing urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) [MD(UAER)= -24.11, 95% CI [-30.54, -17.68], p < 0.01] and albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) [SMD(ACR) = 1.01, 95% CI [-1.73, -0.29], p < 0.01]. The OS adjuvant treatment also improved outcomes of blood pressure, blood glucose, blood lipid, inflammation and oxidative stress. No significant change in fasting blood glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), malondialdehyde (MDA), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) was detected. Yet, no significant difference was found about the adverse events between the two groups. Conclusions: Ophiocordyceps sinensis preparation combined with ACEI/ARB has beneficial influence on renal function, decrease proteinuria, dyslipidemia, and even oxidative stress and inflammation in DKD patients. However, there is no trial that evaluated outcomes of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events. Future study should move beyond surrogate endpoints to actual cardiovascular or renal outcome benefits with an aim to explore effects of OS preparation in the long-term."
"Current understanding of antibiotic-associated dysbiosis and approaches for its management","Kesavelu D., Jog P.","Therapeutic Advances in Infectious Disease","10.1177/20499361231154443","10",NA,"2023","Increased exposure to antibiotics during early childhood increases the risk of antibiotic-associated dysbiosis, which is associated with reduced diversity of gut microbial species and abundance of certain taxa, disruption of host immunity, and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes. The disruption of gut microbiota and host immunity in early life is linked to the development of immune-related and metabolic disorders later in life. Antibiotic administration in populations predisposed to gut microbiota dysbiosis, such as newborns, obese children, and children with allergic rhinitis and recurrent infections; changes microbial composition and diversity; exacerbating dysbiosis and resulting in negative health outcomes. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), Clostridiodes difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), and Helicobacter pylori infection are all short-term consequences of antibiotic treatment that persist from a few weeks to months. Changes in gut microbiota, which persist even 2 years after antibiotic exposure, and the development of obesity, allergies, and asthma are among the long-term consequences. Probiotic bacteria and dietary supplements can potentially prevent or reverse antibiotic-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis. Probiotics have been demonstrated in clinical studies to help prevent AAD and, to a lesser extent, CDAD, as well as to improve H pylori eradication rates. In the Indian setting, probiotics (Saccharomyces boulardii and Bacillus clausii) have been shown to reduce the duration and frequency of acute diarrhea in children. Antibiotics may exaggerate the consequences of gut microbiota dysbiosis in vulnerable populations already affected by the condition. Therefore, prudent use of antibiotics among neonates and young children is critical to prevent the detrimental effects on gut health."

Review Manager 5.4, Stata SE 15 and R 4.0.4 statistical software were used to analyze date. The ranking probability is assessed according to the surfaces under cumulative ranking (SUCRA). Results: 163 studies were eligible for this study, involving 336 arms and 18,257 children, and 10 different interventions. The results showed that the eradication rates of sequential therapy with probiotics (SP), bismuth-containing quadruple (Quadruple) therapy, concomitant therapy and PCN therapy were at least 90%. Cumulative ranking showed that SP therapy had the best eradication effect (SUCRA 92.7%) whereas Bismuth-containing triple therapy (B) had the worst (SUCRA 3.5%). Subgroup analysis suggested that SP therapy ranked first in China and other regions, and the ranking of Triple therapy with probiotics therapy (TP) was equally stable (SUCRA 72.0% vs 76.4% respectively). The security of the SP and TP therapy had great advantages. Conclusions: As for the eradication treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in children, SP therapy ranks highest. SP and TP therapies are most safe."
"What do we know about nutrient-based strategies targeting molecular mechanisms associated with obesity-related fatty liver disease?","Rivera-Iñiguez I., Panduro A., Roman S., González-Aldaco K.","Annals of Hepatology","10.1016/j.aohep.2022.100874","28","1","2023","Obesity is a risk factor for developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and the associated molecular mechanisms could be targeted with nutrient-based strategies. Therefore, it is necessary to review the current mechanisms to propose further treatments. Obesity facilitates the onset of insulin resistance, lipidic abnormalities, hepatic fat accumulation, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and inflammation, all related to further steatosis progression and fibrosis. Microbiota alterations can also influence liver disease by the translocation of pathogenic bacteria, energy extraction from short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), intestinal suppression of the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), reduction of bile acids, and altered choline metabolism. There are also genetic polymorphisms in metabolic proteins that predispose to a higher risk of liver diseases, such as those found in the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3), transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2), membrane-bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing 7 (MBOAT7) or also known as lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase 1 (LPIAT1), transmembrane channel-like 4 genes (TMC4), fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), the b Klotho (KLB) and carboxylesterase (CES1). No clear dietary guidelines target all mechanisms related to NAFLD development and progression. However, energy and carbohydrate intake restriction, regular physical exercise, supplementation of antioxidants, and restoration of gut microbiota seem to have beneficial effects on the new proposed features of NAFLD."

"Can we change the natural course of inflammatory bowel disease?","Le Berre C., Danese S., Peyrin-Biroulet L.","Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology","10.1177/17562848231163118","16",NA,"2023","Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are lifelong diseases characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract leading to its progressive and irreversible destruction. Whether early initiation of IBD-specific therapy impacts the long-term course of the disease remains unclear and has to be further explored in prospective disease-modification trials. Historically, surgery and hospitalization rates have been the surrogate markers to measure disease progression in IBD, providing an overview of the effectiveness of medical therapies. However, neither surgery nor hospitalization necessarily reflects a fail in therapeutic medical management, and many confounding factors make them biased outcomes. The Selecting Endpoints for Disease-Modification Trials consensus has defined the disease-modification endpoints required for these trials, including the impact of the disease on patient’s life (health-related quality of life, disability, and fecal incontinence), the mid-term disease complications (bowel damage in CD, IBD-related surgery and hospitalizations, disease extension in UC, extra-intestinal manifestations, permanent stoma, short bowel syndrome), and the development of dysplasia/cancer and mortality in the long term. Most available data in the literature regarding the impact of current therapies on disease progression focused on anti-tumor necrosis factor agents and are based on retrospective or post-hoc studies. Thus, prospective disease-modification trials are pressingly required to explore the effectiveness of early intensified treatment in patients with severe disease or at risk for disease progression."

The underlying mechanism of depression remain elusive, evidenced by the lack of an appreciate therapy. Recent abundant clinical trials and animal studies support the new notion that the gut microbiota has emerged as a novel actor in the pathophysiology of depression, which partakes in bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain through the neuroendocrine, nervous, and immune signaling pathways, collectively known as the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. Alterations in the gut microbiota can trigger the changes in neurotransmitters, neuroinflammation, and behaviors. With the transition of human microbiome research from studying associations to investigating mechanistic causality, the MGB axis has emerged as a novel therapeutic target in depression and its comorbidities. These novel insights have fueled idea that targeting on the gut microbiota may open new windows for efficient treatment of depression and its comorbidities. Probiotics, live beneficial microorganisms, can be used to modulate gut dysbiosis into a new eubiosis and modify the occurrence and development of depression and its comorbidities. In present review, we summarize recent findings regarding the MGB axis in depression and discuss the potential therapeutic effects of probiotics on depression and its comorbidities."

They provide an uninterrupted, scaled environment capable of simulating the full magnitude of sensory stimuli present in busy health care settings and increase students’ competence and confidence by providing them with accessible and repeatable learning opportunities in a fail-safe environment. Objective: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effects of IVR teaching on the learning outcomes and experiences of undergraduate health care students compared with other teaching methods. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus were searched (last search on May 2022) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental studies published in English between January 2000 and March 2022. The inclusion criteria were studies involving undergraduate students majoring in health care, IVR teaching, and evaluations of students’ learning outcomes and experiences. The methodological validity of the studies was examined using the Joanna Briggs Institute standard critical appraisal instruments for RCTs or quasi-experimental studies. The findings were synthesized without a meta-analysis using vote counting as the synthesis metric. A binomial test with P<.05 was used to test for statistical significance using SPSS (version 28; IBM Corp). The overall quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool. Results: A total of 17 articles from 16 studies totaling 1787 participants conducted between 2007 and 2021 were included. The undergraduate students in the studies majored in medicine, nursing, rehabilitation, pharmacy, biomedicine, radiography, audiology, or stomatology. The IVR teaching domains included procedural training (13/16, 81%), anatomical knowledge (2/16, 12%), and orientation to the operating room setting (1/16, 6%). The quality of the 75% (12/16) of RCT studies was poor, with unclear descriptions of randomization, allocation concealment, and outcome assessor blinding procedures. The overall risk of bias was relatively low in the 25% (4/16) of quasi-experimental studies. A vote count showed that 60% (9/15; 95% CI 16.3%-67.7%; P=.61) of the studies identified similar learning outcomes between IVR teaching and other teaching approaches regardless of teaching domains. The vote count showed that 62% (8/13) of the studies favored using IVR as a teaching medium. The results of the binomial test (95% CI 34.9%-90%; P=.59) did not show a statistically significant difference. Low-level evidence was identified based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool. Conclusions: This review found that undergraduate students had positive learning outcomes and experiences after engaging with IVR teaching, although the effects may be similar to those of other forms of virtual reality or conventional teaching methods. Given the identification of risk of bias and low level of the overall evidence, more studies with a larger sample size and robust study design are required to evaluate the effects of IVR teaching."

A number of studies indicate the presence of a thyroid-gut axis and the important influence of the gut microbiota on thyroid function. As prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics show therapeutic potential in the treatment of intestinal dysbiosis, the aim of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of their supplementation in primary thyroid diseases. Review Methods. Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL), registers of clinical trials, and grey literature up to 6 October 2022 were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) meeting pre-specified inclusion criteria. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021235054). Brief description of the state of knowledge. After screening 1,721 references, two RCTs were identified, which included 136 hypothyroid participants in total. Meta-analysis of the results after eight weeks of supplementation with predominantly Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains indicated a clinically and statistically nonsignificant decrease in TSH (MD –0.19 mIU/L; 95% CI –0.43 to 0.06; I(2) = 0%), and no effect on fT(3) levels (MD 0.01 pg/mL; 95% CI–0.16 to 0.18; I(2) = 0%). Data from single studies indicated no significant change in the levels of fT(4), thyroid auto-antibodies, BMI, levothyroxine doses, and severity of symptoms measured with validated scales. Only constipation scores showed significant improvement (MD –8.71 points in the Faecal Incontinence Questionnaire; 95% CI –15.85 to –1.57; I(2) = 0%). Summary. Low-certainty evidence from two randomised trials, suggests that routine administration of probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics may result in little to no benefit in patients with primary hypothyroidism."
"How can Cytokine-induced killer cells overcome CAR-T cell limits","Cappuzzello E., Vigolo E., D’Accardio G., Astori G., Rosato A., Sommaggio R.","Frontiers in Immunology","10.3389/fimmu.2023.1229540","14",NA,"2023","The successful treatment of patients affected by B-cell malignancies with Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cells represented a breakthrough in the field of adoptive cell therapy (ACT). However, CAR-T therapy is not an option for every patient, and several needs remain unmet. In particular, the production of CAR-T cells is expensive, labor-intensive and logistically challenging; additionally, the toxicities deriving from CAR-T cells infusion, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), have been documented extensively. Alternative cellular therapy products such as Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells have the potential to overcome some of these obstacles. CIK cells are a heterogeneous population of polyclonal CD3(+)CD56(+) T cells with phenotypic and functional properties of NK cells. CIK cell cytotoxicity is exerted in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted manner through the engagement of natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) molecules, against a wide range of hematological and solid tumors without the need for prior antigen exposure or priming. The foremost potential of CIK cells lies in the very limited ability to induce graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) reactions in the allogeneic setting. CIK cells are produced with a simple and extremely efficient expansion protocol, which leads to a massive expansion of effector cells and requires a lower financial commitment compared to CAR-T cells. Indeed, CAR-T manufacturing involves the engineering with expensive GMP-grade viral vectors in centralized manufacturing facilities, whereas CIK cell production is successfully performed in local academic GMP facilities, and CIK cell treatment is now licensed in many countries. Moreover, the toxicities observed for CAR-T cells are not present in CIK cell-treated patients, thus further reducing the costs associated with hospitalization and post-infusion monitoring of patients, and ultimately encouraging the delivery of cell therapies in the outpatient setting. This review aims to give an overview of the limitations of CAR-T cell therapy and outline how the use of CIK cells could overcome such drawbacks thanks to their unique features. We highlight the undeniable advantages of using CIK cells as a therapeutic product, underlying the opportunity for further research on the topic."

This systematic review aimed to study the clinical profile and outcome of patients with leptospirosis in India. Methodology: All articles up to 02.08.2022 were searched using the two databases, PubMed and Scopus. A total of 542 articles were found using the search terms related to ‘leptospirosis’ and ‘India’. After two rounds of screening, 55 articles were included. The data were collected on epidemiology, clinical features, laboratory features and treatment of patients with leptospirosis. Results: Most cases of leptospirosis were reported from the coastal belt. A large percentage of patients were identified as farmers, and exposure to rainfall was identified as an important risk factor. Fever was present in 97%, and conjunctival suffusion was present in 35% of cases. Haemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and haematuria were present in 5%, 5% and 12% of patients, respectively. Liver and kidney were involved in 34% and 35% of the patients, respectively. The aver-age haemoglobin, leucocyte count and platelet count across various studies ranged from 9.6-12.5 grams/ dl, 8.8-11.3 thousand/µl and 20-130 thousand/µl, re-spectively. Treatment details were sparsely available in some studies, with penicillin, ceftriaxone, and dox-ycycline used commonly. The pooled mortality across various studies was calculated as 11% [95% CI-8-15%, I(2)=93%, P<0.001]. Conclusions: Leptospirosis is associated with significant mortality in Indian settings.

Throughout the years, epidemiologic surveillance efforts and infection prevention measures have been focused on combating healthcare-associated CDIs. Nonetheless, the incidence of community-associated infection is currently witnessing an upsurge. In the meantime, insufficient clinicians’ awareness, inadequate frequency of testing, or a suboptimal diagnostic scheme can result in underdiagnosis with the subsequent pervasion of CDIs. Another factor contributing to the escalating morbidities is the scarcity of anti-clostridial therapeutics that can tackle notorious re-infections and relapses. Altogether, these factors warrant raising awareness about epidemiologic patterns, diagnostic algorithms, and the updated treatment regimens for CDI."

New therapeutic options in the treatment of infectious diseases in gynecology are covered. The review shows the significance of preserving the specific functioning of the vaginal microecosystem, searching for new effective therapeutic opportunities in the treatment of infectious and inflammatory diseases and correction of dysbiotic disorders of the vaginal microbiota, its ability to resist pathogenic microorganisms. The unique local immune status directly correlates with the specific microbial composition of the vagina. Recent studies have shown the high efficiency of intestinal microbiota transplantation in gastroenterology. To date, there is a promising concept of introducing selective microbiota transplantation into clinical practice. According to this concept, it is possible to obtain autoprobiotics that can simultaneously solve the problem of safety during transplantation and provide personalized treatment. It is necessary to carry out further studies on the characteristics of pharmacological properties, on degree of stability and safety, on the ability of microorganisms to multiply in the vagina, and on the determination of dosage and frequency of use. The effectiveness of vaginal microbiota transplantation should be determined and proven in subsequent randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials. Conclusion: Autoprobiotics originating from the vagina can become the basis for the development of personalized medicines using a person’s own microbiota as it is safe and accessible and can help in the treatment of diseases with complex etiology and pathogenesis. Preliminary clinical results in a number of experimental studies have demonstrated a good therapeutic effect and great prospects for vaginal microbiota transplantation in comparison with other methods of treatment."

Substantial progress in developing vaccines, enhancing sanitation practices, and implementing various measures to combat the virus, including the utilization of probiotics has been made. This comprehensive review examined the medical impact of clinically proven probiotics on infectious diseases, considering three crucial time periods: before (pre-), during (mid-), and after (post-) COVID-19 pandemic era. This review also showed a perspective on the use of probiotics to stimulate the innate immune system and prevent infectious diseases. In pre-COVID-19 era, several probiotic strains were found to be clinically effective in addressing gastrointestinal infectious diseases, the common cold and flu. However, the mechanism by which probiotics exerted their antiviral effects remained relatively unclear during that period. Nevertheless, probiotics, Lactococcus lactis strain Plasma (LC-Plasma), and others have gained attention for their unique ability to modulate the immune system and demonstrate antiviral properties. While some probiotics have shown promise in alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms linked to COVID-19, their direct effectiveness in treating or preventing COVID-19 progression has not yet been conclusively established. As we transition into the post-COVID-19 era, the relationship between COVID-19 and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), a vital component of the innate immune system, has been gradually elucidated. These findings are now being applied in developing novel vaccines and treatments involving interferons and in immune activation research using probiotics as adjuvants, comparable to CpG-DNA through TLR9. The role of the local innate immune system, including pDCs, as the first line of defense against viral infections has gained increasing interest. Moving forward, insight of the immune system and the crosstalk between probiotics and the innate immune system is expected to highlight the role of probiotics in adjunctive immunoregulatory therapy. In combination with drug treatments, probiotics may play a more substantial role in enhancing immune responses. The immunoregulatory approach using probiotics such as LC-Plasma, which can induce anti-infectious factors such as interferons, holds promise as a viable therapeutic and prophylactic option against viral infectious diseases due to their good safety profile and protective efficacy."

It is a first-in-class inhibitor of type 3 sodium/hydrogen exchanger (NHE3), characterized by very low oral absorption. Its pharmacological properties are discussed here based on the latest literature. Areas covered: A general description of tenapanor is provided, highlighting those pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the drug which may be of major importance for tolerability and safety. This description is associated with a summary and analysis of currently available toxicological data. Expert opinion: Plasma concentrations of free tenapanor after oral administration are well below the half maximal inhibitory concentration for NHE3, so that systemic effects of the drug are minimal. Therefore, the action of tenapanor is limited to NHE3 located on the apical membrane of enterocytes. The consequent reduction in intestinal sodium absorption increases the intraluminal content by osmosis, which in turn enhances the propulsive activity of the colon. Diarrhea is the most frequent adverse effect of tenapanor. Increased fecal sodium and water excretion do not appear to expose patients to short- and long-term hydro-electrolyte imbalances."

Chronic pulmonary infection with MRSA is thought to confer on people with cystic fibrosis a worse clinical outcome and result in an increased rate of lung function decline. Clear guidance for MRSA eradication in cystic fibrosis, supported by robust evidence, is urgently needed. This is an update of a previous review. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment regimens designed to eradicate MRSA and to determine whether the eradication of MRSA confers better clinical and microbiological outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. To ascertain whether attempts at eradicating MRSA can lead to increased acquisition of other resistant organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa), increased adverse effects from drugs, or both. Search methods: We identified randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials by searching the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders (CFGD) Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, PubMed, MEDLINE and three clinical trials registries; by handsearching article reference lists; and through contact with experts in the field. We last searched the CFGD Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register on 4 October 2021, and the ongoing trials registries on 31 January 2022. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of any combinations of topical, inhaled, oral or intravenous antimicrobials primarily aimed at eradicating MRSA compared with placebo, standard treatment or no treatment. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and used the GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results: The review includes three RCTs with 135 participants with MRSA infection. Two trials compared active treatment versus observation only and one trial compared active treatment with placebo. Active treatment versus observation. In both trials (106 participants), active treatment consisted of oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin. One trial administered this combination for two weeks alongside nasal, skin and oral decontamination and a three-week environmental decontamination, while the second trial administered this drug combination for 21 days with five days intranasal mupirocin. Both trials reported successful eradication of MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis, but they used different definitions of eradication. One trial (45 participants) defined MRSA eradication as negative MRSA respiratory cultures at day 28, and reported that oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin may lead to a higher proportion of negative cultures compared to control (odds ratio (OR) 12.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.84 to 55.84; low-certainty evidence). However, by day 168 of follow-up, there was no difference between groups in the proportion of participants who remained MRSA-negative (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.42; low-certainty evidence). The second trial defined successful eradication as the absence of MRSA following treatment in at least three cultures over a period of six months. We are uncertain if the intervention led to results favouring the treatment group as the certainty of the evidence was very low (OR 2.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 11.75). There were no differences between groups in the remaining outcomes for this comparison: quality of life, frequency of exacerbations or adverse effects (all low-certainty evidence) or the change from baseline in lung function or weight (both very low-certainty evidence). The time until next positive MRSA isolate was not reported. The included trials found no differences between groups in terms of nasal colonisation with MRSA. While not a specific outcome of this review, investigators from one study reported that the rate of hospitalisation from screening through day 168 was lower with oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin compared to control (rate ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.72; P = 0.01). Nebulised vancomycin with oral antibiotics versus nebulised placebo with oral antibiotics. The third trial (29 participants) defined eradication as a negative respiratory sample for MRSA at one month following completion of treatment. No differences were reported in MRSA eradication between treatment arms (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.39; low-certainty evidence). No differences between groups were seen in lung function or adverse effects (low-certainty evidence), in quality of life (very low-certainty evidence) or nasal colonisation with MRSA. The trial did not report on the change in weight or frequency of exacerbations. Authors' conclusions: Early eradication of MRSA is possible in people with cystic fibrosis, with one trial demonstrating superiority of active MRSA treatment compared with observation only in terms of the proportion of MRSA-negative respiratory cultures at day 28. However, follow-up at three or six months showed no difference between treatment and control in the proportion of participants remaining MRSA-negative. Moreover, the longer-term clinical consequences – in terms of lung function, mortality and cost of care – remain unclear. Using GRADE methodology, we judged the certainty of the evidence provided by this review to be very low to low, due to potential biases from the open-label design, high rates of attrition and small sample sizes. Based on the available evidence, we believe that whilst early eradication of respiratory MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis is possible, there is not currently enough evidence regarding the clinical outcomes of eradication to support the use of the interventions studied."
"Influence of Vitamin A supplementation on inflammatory biomarkers in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials","Gholizadeh M., Basafa Roodi P., Abaj F., Shab-Bidar S., Saedisomeolia A., Asbaghi O., Lak M.","Scientific reports","10.1038/s41598-022-23919-x","12","1","2022","Vitamin A is an anti-oxidant which has been presumed to act as an anti-infective vitamin in many studies. This study aimed to evaluate the association between vitamin A supplementation and c-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels in randomized control trials (RCTs) studies on adults. A systematic search was performed on databases including PUBMED, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane library. The studies included were considered for data extraction and subsequently assessed for effect. Weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated. Among 13,219 articles 13 studies were included for analysis of CRP and TNF-α, as well as 9 studies included for IL-6 in quality and quantity. The pooled WMD analysis of CRP demonstrated that vitamin A supplementation significantly increased CRP concentration with (WMD: 0.84 mg/L; 95% CI 0.29-1.39, I2 = 0.96.2% and p value < 0.003). However, there was no significant correlation between vitamin A supplementation and lower plasma TNF-α (p < 0.45)). Subgroup analysis by dosage demonstrate significant association between vitamin A supplementation and IL-6 in dosage with 50,000 with (WMD: - 1.53 mg/L; 95% CI - 2.36 to - 0.71, p value < 0.00001) as well as a negative significant association was seen at 44 weeks of supplementation with 50,000 IU/day retinyl palmitate and TNF-a in chronic hepatitis B conditions with (- 0.94 (- 1.19, - 0.69) p < 0.0001). The result of this study demonstrates that supplementation of vitamin A at low and high dosages for short and long durations increases the CRP plasma concentrations on adults and vitamin A supplementation decreases the TNF-α concentrations in chronic hepatitis B on adults. Therefore, there is an inverse association between vitamin A supplementation and plasma and fecal IL-6 concentrations in many infection conditions."

BV is a common and recurring vaginal infection among women of reproductive age and is associated with adverse health outcomes and a decreased quality of life. The current recommended first-line treatment for BV is antibiotics, despite the high recurrence rate. Live biopharmaceutical products/probiotics and vaginal microbiome transplantation (VMT) have also been tested in clinical trials for BV. In this review, we discuss the advantages and challenges of current BV treatments and interventions. Furthermore, we provide our understanding of why current clinical trials with probiotics have had mixed results, which is mainly due to not administering the correct bacteria to the correct body site. Here, we propose a great opportunity for large clinical trials with probiotic strains isolated from the vaginal tract (e.g., Lactobacillus crispatus) and administered directly into the vagina after pretreatment."
"Regulatory role of short-chain fatty acids in inflammatory bowel disease","Zhang Z., Zhang H., Chen T., Shi L., Wang D., Tang D.","Cell Communication and Signaling","10.1186/s12964-022-00869-5","20","1","2022","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises a group of chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Accumulating evidence shows that the development of IBD is always accompanied by the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota (GM), causing a decrease in prebiotic levels and an increase in harmful metabolite levels. This leads to persistent immune response and inflammation in the intestine, greatly impairing the physiological function of the gastrointestinal tract. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced by probiotic gut bacteria from a fiber-rich diet that cannot be digested directly. SCFAs with significant anti-inflammatory functions regulate immune function and prevent an excessive immune response, thereby delaying the clinical progression of IBD. In this review, we summarize the generation of SCFAs and their potential therapeutic effects on IBD. Furthermore, we suggest that SCFAs may modulate innate immune recognition and cytokine production to intervene in the progression of IBD. Additional randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies should also investigate the clinical impact of SCFA. [MediaObject not available: see fulltext.]"

However, the safety of IMT in patients has not been established. Aims: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the safety of IMT. Methods: We systematically reviewed all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IMT studies published up to 28 February 2021 using databases including PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Studies were excluded if they did not report adverse events (AEs). Two authors independently extracted the data. The relative risk (RR) of serious adverse events (SAEs) and common adverse events (CAEs) were estimated separately, as were predefined subgroups. Publication bias was evaluated by a funnel plot and Egger’s regression test. Results: Among 978 reports, 99 full‐text articles were screened, and 20 articles were included for meta-analysis, involving 1132 patients (603 in the IMT group and 529 in the control group). We found no significant difference in the incidence of SAEs between the IMT group and the control group (RR = 1.36, 95% CI 0.56–3.31, P = 0.50). Of these 20 studies, 7 described the number of patients with CAEs, involving 360 patients (195 in the IMT group and 166 in the control group). An analysis of the eight studies revealed that the incidence of CAEs was also not significantly increased in the IMT group compared with the control group (RR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.91–1.23, P = 0.43). Subgroup analysis showed that the incidence of CAEs was significantly different between subgroups of delivery methods (P((CAE)) = 0.04), and the incidence of IMT-related SAEs and CAEs was not significantly different in the other predefined subgroups. Conclusion: Currently, IMT is widely used in many diseases, but its associated AEs should not be ignored. To improve the safety of IMT, patients' conditions should be fully evaluated before IMT, appropriate transplantation methods should be selected, each operative step of faecal bacteria transplantation should be strictly controlled, AE management mechanisms should be improved, and a close follow-up system should be established."
"Effects of screening strategies to detect carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria: A systematic review","Verdugo-Paiva F., Otaiza F., Roson-Rodríguez P., Rojas-Gomez A.M., Galas M., El Omeiri N., Fuentes Y., Rada G., Ramón-Pardo P.","American Journal of Infection Control","10.1016/j.ajic.2022.02.018","50","12","2022","Objective: This systematic review aims to summarize the evidence on the effects of screening strategies to detect carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Methods: Eligible studies were randomized trials, non-randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series. We conducted searches in CENTRAL, PUBMED, Embase, Epistemonikos, and in multiple databases available in the Virtual Health Library (LILACS, Scielo, WHO IBECS, and PAHO IBECS). All the searches covered the period until 4 June 2021. No date or language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies according to predefined selection criteria, and extracted data on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and risk of bias, using a predesigned standardized form. When possible, we intended to conduct meta-analyses using a random-effect model. We assessed the certainty of the evidence (CoE) and summarized the results using the GRADE approach. Results: Our search strategy yielded 57,451 references. No randomized trials were identified. Sixteen studies (one controlled before-after study and 15 interrupted time series) met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Most studies were conducted in tertiary care general hospitals from the United States, Europe, and Asia. Eleven studies included adult patients hospitalized in general wards and intensive care units, one was carried out in a neonatal intensive care unit, two in hematology or oncology units, and one in a solid organ transplantation department. Eleven studies were conducted in the setting of an outbreak. Regarding the detection strategy used, all studies included screening strategies for high-risk patients at the moment of admission and 7 studies reported a contact surveillance strategy. Most studies were conducted in settings where infection prevention and control measures were concomitantly installed or reinforced. Data were not suitable for meta-analysis, so the results were presented as a narrative synthesis. Most studies showed a decline in the prevalence of both infection and colonization rates after the implementation of a policy of active surveillance, but the CoE is low. Screening strategies may result in little to no difference in the risk of all-cause mortality and the length of hospital stay. Conclusions: Existing evidence may favor the use of surveillance culture to carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria, but its quality is poor, so solid conclusions cannot be drawn. Well-conducted randomized trials or high-quality quasi-experimental studies are needed to improve the certainty of the existing evidence. These studies should assess the effect of the addition of screening strategies as a single intervention and measure clinically important outcomes such as infection, length of hospital stay, and mortality."

We are all aware that bacteria and other microorganisms have a significant impact on our health. Also, the health of the bacteria directly reflects the health status of the body where they reside. Eventually, alterations in the microbiome at different sites of a body are associated with many different diseases such as obe-sity, IBD, malnutrition, CVD, etc. Microbiota directly or indirectly affects the heart with the for-mation of plaques in the blood vessels, and cell walls become prone to lesion development. This ultimately leads to heightening the overall inflammatory status via increased bacterial translocation. Metabolites derived from the gut microbial metabolism of choline, phosphatidylcholine, and L-car-nitine directly contribute to CVD pathology. These dietary nutrients have trimethylamine (TMA) moiety, which participates in the development of atherosclerotic heart disease. The objective of this review was to examine various metabolic pathways regulated by the gut microbiome that appear to alter heart function and lead to the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases, as well as how to target the gut microbiome for a healthier heart. In this review, we also discussed various clinical drugs having crosstalk between microbiota and heart and clinical trials for the gut-heart microbiome."

The drug has drawn much interest from practising dermatologists in view of its exceptional safety profile and prescription convenience, as evident by the recent surge of literature describing its off-label indications. This review was carried out with the aim of summarizing the literature on off-label use of apremilast in dermatology, in order to guide clinicians regarding currently available evidence. The PubMed database was searched using ‘apremilast’ as a keyword in the title. Abstracts were individually screened to determine whether there was a description of an off-label use of apremilast in dermatology within the article. Randomized controlled trial data were available for vitiligo, alopecia areata, hidradenitis suppurativa and atopic dermatitis. Case series and case reports describing apremilast were also reviewed. Owing to its broad spectrum of immunomodulatory activity, apremilast may be useful in several chronic inflammatory skin diseases recalcitrant to conventional therapies, either alone or in combination with other drugs. Further studies are needed to establish its role in various dermatological indications."

Childhood obesity drives many comorbidities including hypertension, fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Prior research suggests that aberrant compositional development of the gut microbiome, with low-grade inflammation, precedes being overweight. Therefore, childhood may provide opportunities for interventions that shape the microbiome to mitigate obesity-related diseases. Children with obesity have gut microbiota compositional and functional differences, including increased proinflammatory bacterial taxa, compared to lean controls. Restoration of the gut microbiota to a healthy state may ameliorate conditions associated with obesity and help maintain a healthy weight. Pediatric bariatric (weight-loss) surgery is an effective treatment for childhood obesity; however, there is limited research into the role of the gut microbiome after weight-loss surgery in children. This review will discuss the magnitude of childhood obesity, the importance of the developing microbiome in establishing metabolic pathways, interventions such as bariatric surgery that may modulate the gut microbiome, and future directions for the potential development of microbiome-based therapeutics to treat obesity."

Methods: The data were collected according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol guidelines. Inclusion criteria were articles that assessed administration of any cannabinoid to any clinical population, reported in the ClinicalTrials.gov or PubMed databases, that involved a comparison with other treatment or placebo and a result measurement to assess the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the cannabinoid. Exclusion criteria were review or letter; articles not in the English language; not full-text articles; not a clinical trial, case report, case series, open-label trial, or pilot study; administration in animals, in vitro, or in healthy participants; cannabinoids administered in combination with other cannabinoids (except for cannabidiol [CBD] or tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]) or as whole cannabis extracts; no stated concentration; inhalation or smoke as a route of administration; and no results described. The articles were assessed by the risk of bias. Finding: In total, 1668 articles were recovered, of which 55 studies met the inclusion criteria for 21 diseases. Positive effects were reported in clinical studies: 52% with THC (range, 0.01–0.5 mg/kg/d [0.62–31 mg/d]), 74% with CBD (range, 1–50 mg/kg/d [62–3100 mg/d]), 64% with THC-CBD (mean, 1:1.3 mg/kg/d [ratio, 1:1]), and 100% with tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) (0.2 mg/kg/d). Implications: THC, CBD, and THCV can regulate activity in several pathologies. New studies of cannabinoids are highly encouraged because each patient is unique and requires a unique cannabinoid medication."
"Treatment of enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid fever) with cephalosporins","Kuehn R., Stoesser N., Eyre D., Darton T.C., Basnyat B., Parry C.M.","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","10.1002/14651858.CD010452.pub2","2022","11","2022","Background: Typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric fever) are febrile bacterial illnesses common in many low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends treatment with azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone due to widespread resistance to older, first-line antimicrobials. Resistance patterns vary in different locations and are changing over time. Fluoroquinolone resistance in South Asia often precludes the use of ciprofloxacin. Extensively drug-resistant strains of enteric fever have emerged in Pakistan. In some areas of the world, susceptibility to old first-line antimicrobials, such as chloramphenicol, has re-appeared. A Cochrane Review of the use of fluoroquinolones and azithromycin in the treatment of enteric fever has previously been undertaken, but the use of cephalosporins has not been systematically investigated and the optimal choice of drug and duration of treatment are uncertain. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of cephalosporins for treating enteric fever in children and adults compared to other antimicrobials. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 24 November 2021. We also searched reference lists of included trials, contacted researchers working in the field, and contacted relevant organizations. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults and children with enteric fever that compared a cephalosporin to another antimicrobial, a different cephalosporin, or a different treatment duration of the intervention cephalosporin. Enteric fever was diagnosed on the basis of blood culture, bone marrow culture, or molecular tests. Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were clinical failure, microbiological failure and relapse. Our secondary outcomes were time to defervescence, duration of hospital admission, convalescent faecal carriage, and adverse effects. We used the GRADE approach to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. Main results: We included 27 RCTs with 2231 total participants published between 1986 and 2016 across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the Caribbean, with comparisons between cephalosporins and other antimicrobials used for the treatment of enteric fever in children and adults. The main comparisons are between antimicrobials in most common clinical use, namely cephalosporins compared to a fluoroquinolone and cephalosporins compared to azithromycin. Cephalosporin (cefixime) versus fluoroquinolones. Clinical failure, microbiological failure and relapse may be increased in patients treated with cefixime compared to fluoroquinolones in three small trials published over 14 years ago: clinical failure (risk ratio (RR) 13.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.24 to 55.39; 2 trials, 240 participants; low-certainty evidence); microbiological failure (RR 4.07, 95% CI 0.46 to 36.41; 2 trials, 240 participants; low-certainty evidence); relapse (RR 4.45, 95% CI 1.11 to 17.84; 2 trials, 220 participants; low-certainty evidence). Time to defervescence in participants treated with cefixime may be longer compared to participants treated with fluoroquinolones (mean difference (MD) 1.74 days, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.98, 3 trials, 425 participants; low-certainty evidence). Cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) versus azithromycin. Ceftriaxone may result in a decrease in clinical failure compared to azithromycin, and it is unclear whether ceftriaxone has an effect on microbiological failure compared to azithromycin in two small trials published over 18 years ago and in one more recent trial, all conducted in participants under 18 years of age: clinical failure (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.57; 3 trials, 196 participants; low-certainty evidence); microbiological failure (RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.36 to 10.64, 3 trials, 196 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether ceftriaxone increases or decreases relapse compared to azithromycin (RR 10.05, 95% CI 1.93 to 52.38; 3 trials, 185 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Time to defervescence in participants treated with ceftriaxone may be shorter compared to participants treated with azithromycin (mean difference of −0.52 days, 95% CI −0.91 to −0.12; 3 trials, 196 participants; low-certainty evidence). Cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) versus fluoroquinolones. It is unclear whether ceftriaxone has an effect on clinical failure, microbiological failure, relapse, and time to defervescence compared to fluoroquinolones in three trials published over 28 years ago and two more recent trials: clinical failure (RR 3.77, 95% CI 0.72 to 19.81; 4 trials, 359 participants; very low-certainty evidence); microbiological failure (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.40 to 6.83; 3 trials, 316 participants; very low-certainty evidence); relapse (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.92; 3 trials, 297 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and time to defervescence (MD 2.73 days, 95% CI −0.37 to 5.84; 3 trials, 285 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether ceftriaxone decreases convalescent faecal carriage compared to the fluoroquinolone gatifloxacin (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.72; 1 trial, 73 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and length of hospital stay may be longer in participants treated with ceftriaxone compared to participants treated with the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin (mean of 12 days (range 7 to 23 days) in the ceftriaxone group compared to a mean of 9 days (range 6 to 13 days) in the ofloxacin group; 1 trial, 47 participants; low-certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: Based on very low- to low-certainty evidence, ceftriaxone is an effective treatment for adults and children with enteric fever, with few adverse effects. Trials suggest that there may be no difference in the performance of ceftriaxone compared with azithromycin, fluoroquinolones, or chloramphenicol. Cefixime can also be used for treatment of enteric fever but may not perform as well as fluoroquinolones. We are unable to draw firm general conclusions on comparative contemporary effectiveness given that most trials were small and conducted over 20 years previously. Clinicians need to take into account current, local resistance patterns in addition to route of administration when choosing an antimicrobial."

This study aims to provide an overview of research trends in the field, and act as a reference point for future scientific research by analyzing the state of current research, identifying hotspots, and potential frontiers of FMT. Methods: Articles relating to FMT that were published between the years 2012 and 2021 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. Bibliometric analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel and CiteSpace. Results: A total of 2,403 English language articles relating to FMT research were published over the last ten years. Most of this research was carried out in the United States of America, with Harvard Medical school being the most productive institution. Much of the research was published in the PLoS One journal. Alexander Khoruts was identified as a prominent, productive researcher in the field. Keyword analysis revealed that research hot spots included gut microbiota, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and diseases. Burst detection indicated that future research frontiers include clinical practice guidelines and strategies. Conclusion: Our analysis explored hot spots and emerging trends in the FMT field. Indications for use of FMT extended from digestive system diseases to other systemic diseases. Additionally, areas such as risk assessment and control, along with application methods were also a focus of current research. Moreover, research relating to optimization of clinical practice has excellent prospects."

Recurrent C. difficile infection (RCDI) is defined as laboratory or endoscopically confirmed episode of CDI after at least 1 course of approved antibiotic regimen. Results: A total of 7 studies with 238 patients were included in meta-analysis. Compared with MT, FMT did not have a statistically significant difference for clinical cure of combined primary and RCDI after first session [risk ratio (RR): 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.90, 2.58; P=0.12; I (2)=77%] and multiple sessions of FMT (RR: 1.68; CI: 0.96, 2.94; P=0.07; I (2)=82%). On subgroup analysis, FMT has statistically higher rate of response than MT (RR: 2.41; CI: 1.20, 4.83; I (2)=78%) for RCDI. However, for primary CDI there is no statistically significant difference between FMT and MT (RR: 1.00; CI: 0.72, 1.39; I (2)=0%). Conclusion: As per our analysis, FMT should not be utilized for every patient with CDI. It is more effective in RCDI, but the results were not significant in patients with primary CDI."
"Dynamic impact of virome on colitis and colorectal cancer: Immunity, inflammation, prevention and treatment","Wang Z., Guo K., Liu Y., Huang C., Wu M.","Seminars in Cancer Biology","10.1016/j.semcancer.2021.10.004","86",NA,"2022","The gut microbiome includes a series of microorganism genomes, such as bacteriome, virome, mycobiome, etc. The gut microbiota is critically involved in intestine immunity and diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC); however, the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Clarifying the relationship between microbiota and inflammation may profoundly improve our understanding of etiology, disease progression, patient management, and the development of prevention and treatment. In this review, we discuss the latest studies of the influence of enteric viruses (i.e., commensal viruses, pathogenic viruses, and bacteriophages) in the initiation, progression, and complication of colitis and colorectal cancer, and their potential for novel preventative approaches and therapeutic application. We explore the interplay between gut viruses and host immune systems for its effects on the severity of inflammatory diseases and cancer, including both direct and indirect interactions between enteric viruses with other microbes and microbial products. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of the virome's roles in gut inflammatory response have been explained to infer potential therapeutic targets with examples in specific clinical trials. Given that very limited literature has thus far discussed these various topics with the gut virome, we believe these extensive analyses may provide insight into the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of IBD and CRC, which could help add the design of improved therapies for these important human diseases."

IBD is often diagnosed in early adulthood and can lead to a substantial decline in quality of life. It has been suggested that patients with IBD are at increased risk of depression and anxiety, but it is still unclear to what extent these diseases co-occur and in what sequence they arise. This Review summarizes the literature on the degree of co-occurrence of IBD with depression and anxiety and the temporal relationship between these diseases. We also discuss the effect of psychological stress on the onset and course of IBD. In addition, we outline the possible mechanisms underlying the co-occurrence of IBD and depression and anxiety, which include changes in brain signalling and morphology, increases in peripheral and intracerebral pro-inflammatory cytokines, impairment of the nitric oxide pathway, changes in vagal nerve signalling, gut dysbiosis and genetics. Finally, we examine the possible effects of treatment of depression and anxiety on the risk and course of IBD, the influence of psychological interventions on IBD, and the effects of IBD treatment on psychiatric comorbidity."

We aimed to assess the research trends and hotspots in the field of FMT through a quantitative method. Materials and Methods: The clinical studies of FMT published from 2001 to 2021 were extracted from the Web of Science database. We analyzed the countries, institutions, authors, and keywords of these articles and visually illustrated using VOSviewer and CiteSpace software. The current application of FMT in clinical practice, including indications, efficacy, adverse events, as well as its methodology, such as donor, delivery route, were also evaluated. Results: A total of 227 records were finally identified. The number and rate of annual publications increased gradually. The USA ranked highest in the number of publications. Harvard University was the most influential institution, and Digestive Diseases and Sciences was the most productive journal. Kassam Zain published the most papers, and the high-frequency keywords were mainly related to diseases and techniques. Healthy donors were the most widely used donors, and frozen stool had the highest frequency of use. The predominant delivery route was endoscopy followed by oral capsules and enema. FMT was most frequently performed for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium Difficile Infection. The overall efficacy of FMT was 76.88%, and the incidence of minor and severe adverse events were 11.63% and 1.59%, respectively. Conclusions: This study delineated a comprehensive landscape of the advancement in FMT field. Although in its infancy, FMT is a burgeoning option for the treatment of a variety of diseases associated with gut dysbiosis. To improve the efficacy and reduce adverse events, future studies are warranted to optimize the methodology of FMT."

Describe the frequency of viral RNA detection in stools in a cohort of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 2. Perform a systematic review to assess the clearance time in stools of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study in two centers between March and May 2020. We included SARS-CoV-2 infected patients of any age and severity. We collected seriated nasopharyngeal swabs and stool samples to detect SARS-CoV-2. After, we performed a systematic review of the prevalence and clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in stools (PROSPERO-ID: CRD42020192490). We estimated prevalence using a random-effects model. We assessed clearance time by using Kaplan–Meier curves. Results: We included 32 patients; mean age was 43.7 ± 17.7 years, 43.8% were female, and 40.6% reported gastrointestinal symptoms. Twenty-five percent (8/32) of patients had detectable viral RNA in stools. The median clearance time in stools of the cohort was 11[10–15] days. Systematic review included 30 studies (1392 patients) with stool samples. Six studies were performed in children and 55% were male. The pooled prevalence of viral detection in stools was 34.6% (twenty-four studies, 1393 patients; 95%CI:25.4–45.1); heterogeneity was high (I(2):91.2%, Q:208.6; p ≤ 0.001). A meta-regression demonstrates an association between female-gender and lower presence in stools (p = 0.004). The median clearance time in stools was 22 days (nineteen studies, 140 patients; 95%CI:19–25). After 34 days, 19.9% (95%CI:11.3–29.7) of patients have a persistent detection in stools. Conclusions: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stools is a frequent finding. The clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in stools is prolonged and it takes longer than nasopharyngeal secretions."

Methods: Medline, CINAHL, ProQuest, Web of Science, Mednar, and Google Scholar were searched for primary studies, published in English (1978-February 2021), evaluating the microbiological effectiveness or hand surface coverage of HH techniques in healthcare workers. Reviewers independently performed quality assessment using Cochrane tools. The protocol for the narrative review was registered (PROSPERO 2021: CRD42021236138). Results: Nine studies were included. Evidence demonstrated that the WHO technique reduced microbial load on hands. One study found the WHO technique more effective than the 3-step technique (P = .02), while another found no difference between these 2 techniques (P = .08). An adapted 3-step technique was more effective than the WHO technique in laboratory settings (P = .021), but not in clinical practice (P =. 629). One study demonstrated that an adapted 6-step technique was more effective than the WHO technique (P = .001). Evidence was heterogeneous in application time, product, and volume. All studies were high risk of bias. Conclusions: Eight studies found that the WHO 6-step technique reduced microbial load on healthcare workers’ hands; but the studies were heterogeneous and further research is required to identify the most effective, yet feasible technique."

In particular, gut microbiota dysbiosis has been associated with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Furthermore, increasing data also suggest an effect of the gut microbiota on outcome after autologous HCT and CAR T cells. In fact, the bacterial gut microbiota interplays with the immune system and contributes to immunological complication and antitumour response to treatment. Therefore, faecal microbiota transplantation has been evaluated in patients with haematological malignancies for various indications, including Clostridioides difficile infection, eradication of multidrug-resistant bacteria, and steroid refractory acute GVHD. In addition, use of prophylactic faecal microbiota transplantation to restore the gut microbiota and improve patients’ outcomes is being developed in the setting of allogeneic HCT, but also probably very soon in patients receiving autologous HCT or CAR T cells."
"Effects of hydrogen rich water and pure water on periodontal inflammatory factor level, oxidative stress level and oral flora: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Bai Y., Wang C., Jiang H., Wang L., Li N., Zhang W., Liu H.","Annals of Translational Medicine","10.21037/atm-22-4422","10","20","2022","Background: Hydrogen rich water (HRW) was used as an auxiliary treatment for periodontitis and peri-implantitis due to its good antioxidant properties. However, the stability of artificially added active hydrogen was far less than that of pure natural active hydrogen, which greatly reduced active hydrogen molecules number in HRW. Meanwhile, the effect of HRW was relatively slow. Finally, long-term drinking of HRW may cause abnormal liver function. Hence, this study sought to summarize and analyze the effects of HRW on oral inflammation and oral flora in various studies to determine whether HRW can be used to inhibit dental plaque formation and aliviate oral inflammation. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of HRW and pure water (PW) in the treatment of periodontal diseases published before March 2022 in the PubMed, Web of science, EMBASE, Cochrane, China Knowledge Resource Integrated, Wanfang, and Weipu databases were searched. Changes in the inflammatory factor levels, oxidative stress response, and oral flora were summarized and used as outcome indicators. The quality of included studies was assessed by Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool, and the standardized mean differences (SMD) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Review Manager 5.3. Results: In total, 17 studies, comprising 304 subjects, were included in this meta-analysis. Among them, 5 studies had a high risk of bias, and the rest had a certain risk of bias, thus, the total risk of bias was medium to low. The levels of interleukin (IL)-1β (SMD =-0.73; 95% CI: ̵1.29 to -0.18; P=0.009), tumor necrosis factor alpha (SMD =-2.51; 95% CI: ̵3.56 to ̵1.46; P<0.00001), IL-6 (SMD =-1.31; 95% CI: ̵1.96 to ̵0.67; P<0.0001), 8-hydroxyguanosine (SMD =-1.61; 95% CI: ̵2.35 to -0.87; P<0.0001), and reactive oxygen metabolites (SMD =-0.49; 95% CI: -0.91 to -0.06; P=0.02) in the HRW group decreased significantly, while the glutathione peroxidase level increased (SMD =2.5; 95% CI: 1.85 to 3.15; P<0.00001). Additionally, HRW was shown to effectively inhibit oral pathogenic bacteria activity (SMD =-0.91; 95% CI: ̵1.16 to -0.66; P<0.00001).

"Short-chain fatty acids are key mediators of the favorable effects of the Mediterranean diet on intestinal barrier integrity: data from the randomized controlled LIBRE trial","Seethaler B., Nguyen N.K., Basrai M., Kiechle M., Walter J., Delzenne N.M., Bischoff S.C.","American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","10.1093/ajcn/nqac175","116","4","2022","Background: The Mediterranean diet is associated with the prevention of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, all of which are linked to intestinal barrier impairment. Objectives: Here, we hypothesize that the Mediterranean diet, possibly via the induction of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), improves intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, we aim to establish novel personalized nutrition advice based on machine learning algorithms. Methods: We studied 260 women with intestinal barrier impairment. The women were allocated to follow either a Mediterranean diet or a control diet for 3 mo. Intestinal permeability was assessed by measuring lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) in plasma and zonulin in feces. SCFA concentrations were analyzed in feces. Bi- and multivariate analyses and machine learning algorithms (random forest classification) were conducted. Results: Particularly in the intervention group, adherence to the Mediterranean diet increased, whereas plasma LBP and fecal zonulin concentrations decreased (all q < 0.001 for the intervention group, all q < 0.1 for control group). In the intervention group, fecal SCFA concentrations increased (propionate + 19%; butyrate + 44%; both q < 0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with SCFA concentrations (all q < 0.001) and inversely associated with LBP and zonulin concentrations (all q < 0.02). Mediation analyses identified propionate and butyrate as the key mechanistic link between diet and intestinal permeability integrity. Accordingly, using baseline SCFA data, we could predict the effect of the Mediterranean diet on intestinal permeability using a machine learning algorithm (receiver operating characteristic AUC: 0.78-0.96). Conclusions: Our data suggest that SCFAs are key mediators for the relation between diet and gut health. Assessment of SCFAs may form a basis for personalized nutrition in future clinical care. These results need to be verified in larger studies powered for this purpose, comprising different study populations."

"Synbiotics, prebiotics and probiotics for solid organ transplant recipients","Cooper T.E., Scholes-Robertson N., Craig J.C., Hawley C.M., Howell M., Johnson D.W., Teixeira-Pinto A., Jaure A., Wong G.","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","10.1002/14651858.CD014804.pub2","2022","9","2022","Background: Solid organ transplantation has seen improvements in both surgical techniques and immunosuppression, achieving prolonged survival. Essential to graft acceptance and post-transplant recovery, immunosuppressive medications are often accompanied by a high prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and side effects. Apart from GI side effects, long-term exposure to immunosuppressive medications has seen an increase in drug-related morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, and malignancy. Non-adherence to immunosuppression can lead to an increased risk of graft failure. Recent research has indicated that any microbial imbalances (otherwise known as gut dysbiosis or leaky gut) may be associated with cardiometabolic diseases in the long term. Current evidence suggests a link between the gut microbiome and the production of putative uraemic toxins, increased gut permeability, and transmural movement of bacteria and endotoxins and inflammation. Early observational and intervention studies have been investigating food-intake patterns, various synbiotic interventions (antibiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics), and faecal transplants to measure their effects on microbiota in treating cardiometabolic diseases. It is believed high doses of synbiotics, prebiotics and probiotics are able to modify and improve dysbiosis of gut micro-organisms by altering the population of the micro-organisms. With the right balance in the gut flora, a primary benefit is believed to be the suppression of pathogens through immunostimulation and gut barrier enhancement (less permeability of the gut). Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of synbiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics for recipients of solid organ transplantation. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 9 March 2022 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials measuring and reporting the effects of synbiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics, in any combination and any formulation given to solid organ transplant recipients (any age and setting). Two authors independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts and, where necessary, the full text to determine which satisfied the inclusion criteria. Data collection and analysis: Data extraction was independently carried out by two authors using a standard data extraction form. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross-checked by another. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Main results: Five studies (250 participants) were included in this review. Study participants were adults with a kidney (one study) or liver (four studies) transplant. One study compared a synbiotic to placebo, two studies compared a probiotic to placebo, and two studies compared a synbiotic to a prebiotic. Overall, the quality of the evidence is poor. Most studies were judged to have unclear (or high) risk of bias across most domains. Of the available evidence, meta-analyses undertaken were of limited data from small studies. Across all comparisons, GRADE evaluations for all outcomes were judged to be very low certainty evidence. Very low certainty evidence implies that we are very uncertain about results (not estimable due to lack of data or poor quality). Synbiotics had uncertain effects on the change in microbiota composition (total plasma p-cresol), faecal characteristics, adverse events, kidney function or albumin concentration (1 study, 34 participants) compared to placebo. Probiotics had uncertain effects on GI side effects, infection rates immediately post-transplant, liver function, blood pressure, change in fatty liver, and lipids (1 study, 30 participants) compared to placebo. Synbiotics had uncertain effects on graft health (acute liver rejection) (2 studies, 129 participants: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.25; 2 studies, 129 participants; I² = 0%), the use of immunosuppression, infection (2 studies, 129 participants: RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.17; I² = 66%), GI function (time to first bowel movement), adverse events (2 studies, 129 participants: RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.59; I² = 20%), serious adverse events (2 studies, 129 participants: RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.42 to 5.36; I² = 81%), death (2 studies, 129 participants), and organ function measures (2 studies; 129 participants) compared to prebiotics. Authors' conclusions: This review highlights the severe lack of high-quality RCTs testing the efficacy of synbiotics, prebiotics or probiotics in solid organ transplant recipients. We have identified significant gaps in the evidence. Despite GI symptoms and postoperative infection being the most common reasons for high antibiotic use in this patient population, along with increased morbidity and the growing antimicrobial resistance, we found very few studies that adequately tested these as alternative treatments. There is currently no evidence to support or refute the use of synbiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics in solid organ transplant recipients, and findings should be viewed with caution. We have identified an area of significant uncertainty about the efficacy of synbiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics in solid organ transplant recipients. Future research in this field requires adequately powered RCTs comparing synbiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics separately and with placebo measuring a standard set of core transplant outcomes. Six studies are currently ongoing (822 proposed participants); therefore, it is possible that findings may change with their inclusion in future updates."

Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) is a molecular World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended rapid diagnostic test that simultaneously detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance. We previously published a Cochrane Review 'Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assays for tuberculosis disease and rifampicin resistance in children'. The current review updates evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert Ultra in children presumed to have tuberculosis disease. Parts of this review update informed the 2022 WHO updated guidance on management of tuberculosis in children and adolescents. Objectives: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert Ultra for detecting: pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance, in children with presumed tuberculosis. Secondary objectives. To investigate potential sources of heterogeneity in accuracy estimates. For detection of tuberculosis, we considered age, comorbidity (HIV, severe pneumonia, and severe malnutrition), and specimen type as potential sources. To summarize the frequency of Xpert Ultra trace results. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and three trial registers without language restrictions to 9 March 2021. Selection criteria: Cross-sectional and cohort studies and randomized trials that evaluated Xpert Ultra in HIV-positive and HIV-negative children under 15 years of age. We included ongoing studies that helped us address the review objectives. We included studies evaluating sputum, gastric, stool, or nasopharyngeal specimens (pulmonary tuberculosis), cerebrospinal fluid (tuberculous meningitis), and fine needle aspirate or surgical biopsy tissue (lymph node tuberculosis). For detecting tuberculosis, reference standards were microbiological (culture) or composite reference standard; for stool, we also included Xpert Ultra performed on a routine respiratory specimen. For detecting rifampicin resistance, reference standards were drug susceptibility testing or MTBDRplus. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and, using QUADAS-2, assessed methodological quality judging risk of bias separately for each target condition and reference standard. For each target condition, we used the bivariate model to estimate summary sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We stratified all analyses by type of reference standard. We summarized the frequency of Xpert Ultra trace results; trace represents detection of a very low quantity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA. We assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE. Main results: We identified 14 studies (11 new studies since the previous review). For detection of pulmonary tuberculosis, 335 data sets (25,937 participants) were available for analysis. We did not identify any studies that evaluated Xpert Ultra accuracy for tuberculous meningitis or lymph node tuberculosis. Three studies evaluated Xpert Ultra for detection of rifampicin resistance. Ten studies (71%) took place in countries with a high tuberculosis burden based on WHO classification. Overall, risk of bias was low. Detection of pulmonary tuberculosis. Sputum, 5 studies. Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity verified by culture was 75.3% (95% CI 64.3 to 83.8; 127 participants; high-certainty evidence), and specificity was 97.1% (95% CI 94.7 to 98.5; 1054 participants; high-certainty evidence). Gastric aspirate, 7 studies. Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity verified by culture was 70.4% (95% CI 53.9 to 82.9; 120 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and specificity was 94.1% (95% CI 84.8 to 97.8; 870 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Stool, 6 studies. Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity verified by culture was 56.1% (95% CI 39.1 to 71.7; 200 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and specificity was 98.0% (95% CI 93.3 to 99.4; 1232 participants; high certainty-evidence). Nasopharyngeal aspirate, 4 studies. Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity verified by culture was 43.7% (95% CI 26.7 to 62.2; 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and specificity was 97.5% (95% CI 93.6 to 99.0; 489 participants; high-certainty evidence). Xpert Ultra sensitivity was lower against a composite than a culture reference standard for all specimen types other than nasopharyngeal aspirate, while specificity was similar against both reference standards. Interpretation of results. In theory, for a population of 1000 children:. • where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in sputum (by culture):. - 101 would be Xpert Ultra-positive, and of these, 26 (26%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (false positive); and- 899 would be Xpert Ultra-negative, and of these, 25 (3%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). • where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in gastric aspirate (by culture):. - 123 would be Xpert Ultra-positive, and of these, 53 (43%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (false positive); and- 877 would be Xpert Ultra-negative, and of these, 30 (3%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). • where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in stool (by culture):. - 74 would be Xpert Ultra-positive, and of these, 18 (24%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (false positive); and- 926 would be Xpert Ultra-negative, and of these, 44 (5%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). • where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in nasopharyngeal aspirate (by culture):. - 66 would be Xpert Ultra-positive, and of these, 22 (33%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (false positive); and- 934 would be Xpert Ultra-negative, and of these, 56 (6%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). Detection of rifampicin resistance. Xpert Ultra sensitivity was 100% (3 studies, 3 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and specificity range was 97% to 100% (3 studies, 128 participants; low-certainty evidence). Trace results. Xpert Ultra trace results, regarded as positive in children by WHO standards, were common. Xpert Ultra specificity remained high in children, despite the frequency of trace results. Authors' conclusions: We found Xpert Ultra sensitivity to vary by specimen type, with sputum having the highest sensitivity, followed by gastric aspirate and stool. Nasopharyngeal aspirate had the lowest sensitivity. Xpert Ultra specificity was high against both microbiological and composite reference standards. However, the evidence base is still limited, and findings may be imprecise and vary by study setting. Although we found Xpert Ultra accurate for detection of rifampicin resistance, results were based on a very small number of studies that included only three children with rifampicin resistance. Therefore, findings should be interpreted with caution. Our findings provide support for the use of Xpert Ultra as an initial rapid molecular diagnostic in children being evaluated for tuberculosis."
"Targeting the Gut Microbiome to Treat Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease: Ready for Prime Time?","Lanthier N., Delzenne N.","Cells","10.3390/cells11172718","11","17","2022","Numerous studies show a modification of the gut microbiota in patients with obesity or diabetes. Animal studies have also shown a causal role of gut microbiota in liver metabolic disorders including steatosis whereas the human situation is less clear. Patients with metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) also have a modification in their gut microbiota composition but the changes are not fully characterized. The absence of consensus on a precise signature is probably due to disease heterogeneity, possible concomitant medications and different selection or evaluation criteria. The most consistent changes were increased relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia species and decreased abundance of Coprococcus and Eubacterium. Possible mechanisms linking the microbiota and MAFLD are increased intestinal permeability with translocation of microbial products into the portal circulation, but also changes in the bile acids and production of microbial metabolites such as ethanol, short chain fatty acids and amino acid derivatives able to modulate liver metabolism and inflammation. Several interventional studies exist that attempt to modulate liver disease by administering antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics or fecal transplantation. In conclusion, there are both gaps and hopes concerning the interest of gut microbiome evaluation for diagnosis purposes of MAFLD and for new therapeutic developments that are often tested on small size cohorts."
"Gastrointestinal Microbiome and Multiple Health Outcomes: Umbrella Review","Chang C., Yuan X., Zhang X., Chen X., Li K.","Nutrients","10.3390/nu14183726","14","18","2022","In recent years, there has been growing concern about the impact of the gastrointestinal microbiome on human health outcomes. To clarify the evidence for a link between the gastrointestinal microbiome and a variety of health outcomes in humans, we conducted an all-encompassing review of meta-analyses and systematic reviews that included 195 meta-analyses containing 950 unique health outcomes. The gastrointestinal microbiome is related to mortality, gastrointestinal disease, immune and metabolic outcomes, neurological and psychiatric outcomes, maternal and infant outcomes, and other outcomes. Existing interventions for intestinal microbiota (such as probiotics, fecal microbiota transplant, etc.) are generally safe and beneficial to a variety of human health outcomes, but the quality of evidence is not high, and more detailed and well-designed randomized controlled trials are necessary."
"Efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplant in irritable bowel syndrome: An update based on meta-analysis of randomized control trials","Abdelghafar Y.A., AbdelQadir Y.H., Motawea K.R., Nasr S.A., Omran H.A.M., Belal M.M., Elhashash M.M., AbdelAzim A.A., Shah J.","Health Science Reports","10.1002/hsr2.814","5","5","2022","Background and Aims: Fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) is a potential treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Several randomized trials have tested FMT effects using different routes of administration, doses, and sample sizes. We aim to assess the overall efficacy of FMT for IBS patients and the safety of the intervention. Methods: We systematically searched four databases for randomized control trials that studied the efficacy and safety of FMT in IBS patients. Results: We included 8 randomized trials (472 patients) that compared FMT with placebo in IBS patients. Pooled results showed no statistically significant difference between FMT and control groups in the overall change in IBS symptom severity (IBS-SSS) at 1 month (p = 0.94), 3/4 months (p = 0.82), and at the end of trials (p = 0.67). No significant difference in the total number of respondents between the FMT and control groups (risk ratios = 1.84, [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.82–2.65], p = 0.19). Although the oral route of administration showed a significant difference in the number of respondents (p = 0.004), there was no statistically significant difference in the IBS-SSS when subgrouping the oral route of administration (mean difference = 47.57, [95% CI = −8.74–103.87], p = 0.10). Conclusion: FMT is not an effective treatment to relieve all the symptoms of IBS. Even in the groups that showed relatively significant improvement after FMT, the effect was proven to wear off over time and the re-administration carries a low success rate. Future research should consider different bacterial-based interventions such as probiotics or specific antibiotics."
NA,"Weber D.","Oncology Research and Treatment","10.1159/000526456","45",NA,"2022","Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is still associated with a high risk of mortality due to infectious complications and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). The need for a better understanding of intestinal aGvHD pathophysiology has led to growing evidence showing a crucial role of intestinal microbiota. During allogeneic SCT, in particular in cases of aGvHD development a loss of intestinal microbiome diversity can be observed mainly consisting of a reduction of protective bacteria such as Clostridiales and an overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria e.g., Enterococci. Low microbial diversity however is associated with significantly higher transplant-related mortality (TRM), mainly due to aGvHD and poor overall survival. An early and prolonged antibiotic exposure, conditioning regimen toxicity as well as an impaired oral intake have been identified as major risk factors for disrupting the microbiome. Minimal oral intake for a prolonged period is associated with less diversity and less abundance of intestinal Blautia. Malnutrition per se represents an independent negative prognostic factor for survival of SCT recipients. Therefore, parenteral nutrition (PN) is usually recommended during the peri-transplant period. However, few single-center studies with small numbers of patients reported a superiority of enteral nutrition over PN in terms of transplant-related complications and survival as well as increased microbial diversity. Further, in murine models a lactose-free diet was able to reduce enterococcal overgrowth and to mitigate aGvHD severity. Whether a specific diet could help to preserve a healthy microbiome in allogeneic SCT recipients remains to be elucidated in randomized trials. Additionally, high inter-personal variability in microbiome response to types of nutrition might prove it difficult to formulate universal dietary recommendations. Further, it is worth considering microbiota-targeting therapies, that pre-emptively optimize microbiota prior to SCT or restore intestinal diversity post SCT. At present, potential strategies for microbiota modification include prebiotics, probiotics or postbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation. However, large-scaled prospective and randomized studies are needed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of these products in immunosuppressed patients and to investigate their potency with respect to preservation of microbiome diversity and reduction of transplant-related complications."

Design: Systematic review and network meta-analysis. Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov, SinoMed, Chinese Biomedicine, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, and Chongqing VIP Information databases were comprehensively searched from the beginning to February 2022. Review Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including Bailing capsule (BLC); Jinshuibao capsule (JSB); Huangkui capsule (HKC); Compound Xueshuantong capsule (CXC); uremic clearance granule (UCG); Shenyan Kangfu tablet (SYKFT); tripterygium glycosides (TG); Keluoxin capsule (KLX), and Shenshuaining tablet (SSNT) combined with ACEI/ARB for patients with early DKD were reviewed. Data Synthesis: Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Risk ratios (RRs) and mean difference (MD) were reckoned to assess dichotomous variable quantities and continuous variable quantities, respectively. Using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), we then ranked each therapeutic regime. Results: Ultimately, 160 RCTs involving 13,365 patients and nine CPMs were included. UCG showed significantly higher probabilities on urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) when compared with ACEI/ARB group, with MD of −47 (95%CI) (−57, −37) and SUCRA 98.0%. The CXC group achieved a remarkable improvement in overall response rate (ORR) compared with ACEI/ARB (RR, 1.3, 95%CI (1.2, 1.5)) with SUCRA 91.9%. SSNT could be significantly superior to ACEI/ARB group in terms of serum creatinine (Scr) (−19 (−26, −12), SUCRA 99.3%) and adverse effects (AEs) (0.46 (0.17, 1.1), SUCRA 82.9%). BLC showed the greatest effectiveness on 24 h urinary total protein (24 h UTP) (−170 (−260, −83), SUCRA 78.5%) and triglyceride (Trig) (−0.89 (−1.2, −0.53), SUCRA 97.0%). From the cost-effectiveness analysis of CPMs in China, the cost of TG, SYKFT and CXC was 108, 600, and 648 RMB, respectively, per 3 months and were ranked in the top three. Conclusion: UCG and CXC might be the optimum selection for improving UAER and ORR, and SSNT could be significantly superior to ACEI/ARB group in terms of Scr and AEs. BLC shows the best curative effect on 24 h UTP and Trig. TG shows the highest cost-effectiveness among the nine CPMs."
"Preprocedural mouth rinses for preventing transmission of infectious diseases through aerosols in dental healthcare providers","Kumbargere Nagraj S., Eachempati P., Paisi M., Nasser M., Sivaramakrishnan G., Francis T., Verbeek J.H.","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","10.1002/14651858.CD013826.pub2","2022","8","2022","Background: Aerosols and spatter are generated in a dental clinic during aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) that use high-speed hand pieces. Dental healthcare providers can be at increased risk of transmission of diseases such as tuberculosis, measles and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) through droplets on mucosae, inhalation of aerosols or through fomites on mucosae, which harbour micro-organisms. There are ways to mitigate and contain spatter and aerosols that may, in turn, reduce any risk of disease transmission. In addition to personal protective equipment (PPE) and aerosol-reducing devices such as high-volume suction, it has been hypothesised that the use of mouth rinse by patients before dental procedures could reduce the microbial load of aerosols that are generated during dental AGPs. Objectives: To assess the effects of preprocedural mouth rinses used in dental clinics to minimise incidence of infection in dental healthcare providers and reduce or neutralise contamination in aerosols. Search methods: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 4 February 2022. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials and excluded laboratory-based studies. Study participants were dental patients undergoing AGPs. Studies compared any preprocedural mouth rinse used to reduce contaminated aerosols versus placebo, no mouth rinse or another mouth rinse. Our primary outcome was incidence of infection of dental healthcare providers and secondary outcomes were reduction in the level of contamination of the dental operatory environment, cost, change in mouth microbiota, adverse events, and acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors screened search results, extracted data from included studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and judged the certainty of the available evidence. We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the effect estimate for continuous outcomes, and random-effects meta-analysis to combine data. Main results: We included 17 studies with 830 participants aged 18 to 70 years. We judged three trials at high risk of bias, two at low risk and 12 at unclear risk of bias. None of the studies measured our primary outcome of the incidence of infection in dental healthcare providers. The primary outcome in the studies was reduction in the level of bacterial contamination measured in colony-forming units (CFUs) at distances of less than 2 m (intended to capture larger droplets) and 2 m or more (to capture droplet nuclei from aerosols arising from the participant's oral cavity). It is unclear what size of CFU reduction represents a clinically significant amount. There is low- to very low-certainty evidence that chlorhexidine (CHX) may reduce bacterial contamination, as measured by CFUs, compared with no rinsing or rinsing with water. There were similar results when comparing cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) with no rinsing and when comparing CPC, essential oils/herbal mouthwashes or boric acid with water. There is very low-certainty evidence that tempered mouth rinses may provide a greater reduction in CFUs than cold mouth rinses. There is low-certainty evidence that CHX may reduce CFUs more than essential oils/herbal mouthwashes. The evidence for other head-to-head comparisons was limited and inconsistent. The studies did not provide any information on costs, change in micro-organisms in the patient's mouth or adverse events such as temporary discolouration, altered taste, allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. The studies did not assess acceptability of the intervention to patients or feasibility of implementation for dentists. Authors' conclusions: None of the included studies measured the incidence of infection among dental healthcare providers. The studies measured only reduction in level of bacterial contamination in aerosols. None of the studies evaluated viral or fungal contamination. We have only low to very low certainty for all findings. We are unable to draw conclusions regarding whether there is a role for preprocedural mouth rinses in reducing infection risk or the possible superiority of one preprocedural rinse over another. Studies are needed that measure the effect of rinses on infectious disease risk among dental healthcare providers and on contaminated aerosols at larger distances with standardised outcome measurement."

Intermittent enteral nutrition (IEN) may be a suitable alternative method. This meta-analysis aims to investigate the safety, tolerance, and effectiveness of IEN compared with that of CEN in critically ill adults in the ICU. Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for studies published up until April 30, 2020, along with manual searches in bibliographies. Eligible studies were trials that compared CEN with IEN feeding in the ICU and reported on at least one of the relevant outcomes (nutrition intake, gastric residual volume [GRV], aspiration pneumonia, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distension, and glycemic variability). Secondary outcomes were ICU length of stay (LOS) and mortality. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials was used to assess methodological quality. Results: Ten studies with 664 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Most studies had an overall “high” risk of bias. Incidence of vomiting was significantly higher in CEN than in IEN groups (risk ratio, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.23–6.23). There were no significant differences between CEN and IEN groups for nutrition intake, GRV, incidence of aspiration pneumonia, diarrhea, abdominal distension, ICU LOS, and mortality. Definition and reporting of outcome measures were not standardized across studies; hence, this heterogeneity limits the generalizability of results. Conclusion: Overall, the safety, tolerance, and effectiveness of CEN and IEN were found to be comparable. Future studies should explore monitoring larger sample sizes to determine best feeding practices in the ICU."

Moreover, SAP patients with fungal infection exhibit a higher mortality rate than those without infection. Although these clinical studies support pathogenic roles played by fungal infection in SAP, beneficial effects of prophylactic anti-fungal therapy on SAP have not been proved. Here we summarize recent clinical findings as to the relationship between fungal infection and the development of SAP. In addition, we discuss molecular mechanisms accounting for the development of SAP in the presence of fungal infection."

We used the data from the CEREMI trial in which 22 healthy volunteers received a 3-day course of ceftriaxone or cefotaxime antibiotics. Fecal samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene profiling, and the total bacterial counts were determined in each sample by flux cytometry. As the gut exposure to antibiotics could not be experimentally measured despite a marked impact on the gut microbiota, it was reconstructed using the counts of susceptible Escherichia coli. The dynamics of absolute counts of bacterial families were analyzed using a generalized Lotka–Volterra equations and nonlinear mixed effect modeling. Bacterial interactions were studied using a stepwise approach. Two negative and three positive interactions were identified. Introducing bacterial interactions in the modeling approach better fitted the data, and provided different estimates of antibiotic effects on each bacterial family than a simple model without interaction. The time to return to 95% of the baseline counts was significantly longer in ceftriaxone-treated individuals than in cefotaxime-treated subjects for two bacterial families: Akkermansiaceae (median [range]: 11.3 days [0; 180.0] vs. 4.2 days [0; 25.6], p = 0.027) and Tannerellaceae (13.7 days [6.1; 180.0] vs. 6.2 days [5.4; 17.3], p = 0.003). Taking bacterial interaction as well as individual antibiotic exposure profile into account improves the analysis of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis."

Supplementation with probiotics may have beneficial effects on gut inflammation due to their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. The primary objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of a mix of three probiotic strains (Bifidobacterium lactis LA 304, Lactobacillus salivarius LA 302, and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 201; Lactibiane Iki®) in the reduction in fecal calprotectin in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, compared to a control group. The secondary aim was to evaluate the reduction in oxygen support and length of hospital stay in patients taking the probiotic mix. Patients and Methods: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial at Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli, Rome. We enrolled patients with COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia. One group received the probiotic mix twice a day for 10 days in addition to the standard COVID-19 therapy, and a second group received standard COVID-19 therapy without probiotics. We administered oxygen support (through Ventimask or Optiflow®) on days (D) 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10, and the level of fecal calprotectin between D3–D5 and D7–D10. Results: A total of 80 patients (44 M/36 F; mean age: 59.8 ± 17.3) were enrolled with a mean value of calprotectin at enrollment of 140 mg/dl. At D7–10, the probiotic group showed a 35% decrease in fecal calprotectin compared to 16% in the control group, a decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) of 72.7% compared to 62%, and a slight but not significant decrease in oxygen support compared to the control group. Conclusion: Supplementation with a mix of probiotics for 10 days in patients with COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia significantly reduces inflammatory markers."

This process involves adhesion molecules, chemoattractants and receptors expressed on immune cell surfaces, blood vessels and stromal intestinal tissue as well as signalling pathways, including those modulated by sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). The complex biological processes of leukocyte recruitment, activation, adhesion and migration have been targeted by various monoclonal antibodies (vedolizumab, etrolizumab, ontamalimab). Promising preclinical and clinical data with several oral S1P modulators suggest that inhibition of lymphocyte egress from the lymph nodes to the bloodstream might be a safe and efficacious alternative mechanism for reducing inflammation in immune-mediated disorders, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Although various questions remain, including the potential positioning of S1P modulators in treatment algorithms and their long-term safety, this novel class of compounds holds great promise. This Review summarizes the critical mediators and mechanisms involved in immune cell trafficking in IBD and the available evidence for efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of S1P receptor modulators in IBD and other immune-mediated disorders.

The aim of this review was to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral administration of East Asian herbal medicine (EAHM) for inflammatory skin lesions in psoriasis and to explore core herbal materials for drug discovery. A comprehensive search was conducted in 10 electronic databases for randomized controlled trials from their inception until 29 July 2021. Statistical analysis was performed in R version 4.1.2 and R studio. When heterogeneity in studies was detected, the cause was identified through sensitivity analysis, meta-regression, and subgroup analysis. Methodological quality was independently assessed using the revised tool for risk of bias in randomized trials. A total of 56 trials with 4966 psoriasis patients met the selection criteria. Meta-analysis favored EAHM monotherapy on Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 70 (RR: 1.2845; 95% CI: 1.906 to 1.3858, p < 0.0001), PASI 60 (RR: 1.1923; 95% CI: 1.1134 to 1.2769, p < 0.0001), continuous PASI score (MD: −2.3386, 95% CI: −3.3068 to −1.3704, p < 0.0001), IL-17, IL-23, TNF-α, and Dermatology Life Quality Index. Patients treated with EAHM monotherapy had significantly reduced adverse events incidence rate. In addition, based on additional examination of the herb data included in this meta-analysis, 16 core materials were identified. They are utilized in close proximity to one another, and all have anti-inflammatory properties. The findings in this study support that oral EAHM monotherapy may be beneficial for inflammatory skin lesions in psoriasis. Meanwhile, the identified core materials are expected to be utilized as useful drug candidate hypotheses through follow-up studies on individual pharmacological activities and synergistic effects."

Since carbapenems are considered the last drugs of choice, infections caused by these pathogens are difficult to treat and carry a high risk of mortality. Several antibiotic combination regimens have been utilized for the management of CRE infections or to eradicate colonization in CRE carriers with variable clinical responses. In addition, recent studies have explored the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to eradicate CRE infections. Here, we conducted a systematic review of publications in which FMT was used to eliminate CRE colonization in infected individuals. We searched the PubMed, Cochrane, and Medline databases up to November 30, 2021. Ten studies (209 patients) met the inclusion criteria for this review with three articles describing retrospective cohorts (n = 53 patients) and seven reporting prospective data (n = 156 patients), including one randomized open-label clinical trial. All studies were published between 2017 and 2021 with eight studies from Europe and two from South Korea. There were substantial variations in terms of outcome measurements and study endpoint among these studies. Among the 112 FMT recipients with confirmed CRE colonization, CRE decolonization was reported in 55/90 cases at one month after FMT and at the end of the study follow-up (6–12 months), decolonization was documented in 74/94 (78.7%) patients. The predominant CRE strains reported were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli and the most frequently documented carbapenemases were KPC, OXA-48, and NDM. In general, FMT was well tolerated, with no severe complications reported even in immunosuppressed patients and in those with multiple underlying conditions. In conclusion, FMT appears to be safe and effective in eradicating CRE colonization, however, more studies, especially randomized trials, are needed to validate the safety and clinical utility of FMT for CRE eradication."

In this narrative review, possible mechanisms that support how A. muciniphila is implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic-associated disease are described with the evaluation of its role as an intermediary or independent agent whose manipulation could be useful in the management of metabolic disorders. The ampleness of A. muciniphila is notably diminished in obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiometabolic diseases and low-grade inflammation. Furthermore, an inverse relationship between A. muciniphila, body weight and insulin sensitivity has been observed in both humans and animals. Antidiabetic drugs, gastric bypass surgery, prebiotics and biologically active compounds, such as polyphenols or saponins, have been shown to be associated with A. muciniphila relative abundance and thus could have favourable effects on metabolic disorders. Furthermore, A. muciniphila supplementation alone has been correlated with weight reduction and improvement of metabolic disorders, including fat mass gain, adipose tissue inflammation, metabolic endotoxaemia, and insulin resistance. Nevertheless, since the primary beneficial impacts of this bacterium have been predominantly investigated in various preclinical models, these results need to be confirmed in randomized clinical trials."

Searches were carried out in the Pubmed, Web of Science and Scopus databases, with the inclusion criteria: published in the last 11 years, language in English or Spanish and in humans aged 0 to 17 years. The ROBINS-I program for clinical trials and randomized clinical trials was used to study the risk of bias. Results: 116 articles were found for the lactose-free diet, only 1 was included; 81 articles for the gluten-free diet, 4 were included; Forty-one articles of the low.FODMAPs diet were included, 2 and 25 articles of the ketogenic diet were included, 3. In the lactose-free diet, a change is observed after the introduction of dairy foods, highlighting the increase in the levels of fecal lactic acid bacteria, in particular the genus Lactococcus. MI is different in healthy individuals than in those with untreated celiac disease (CD) and in those with CD treated with a gluten-free diet. In individuals with CD, higher levels of Enterobacteria were found, and a greater presence of E. Coli, and lower levels of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Studies were found that a gluten-free diet positively affects MI in children with CD, several studies found that a gluten-free diet is not enough to restore MI in healthy children. In the studies with diet FODMAPs, they show a reduction of bacteria involved in symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome. In the Ketogenic diet studies, an improvement in the microbial pattern and improvement of the symptoms of refractory epilepsy were observed. The risk of bias in the lactose-free diet could not be assessed; there was insufficient information on the gluten-free diet to assess the risk of bias; on the FODMAP diet the risk of bias was very low and on the ketogenic diet the risk of bias could not be assessed due to lack of data. Conclusions: Changes in MI are evident after exclusion of lactose, gluten, reduction of FODMAPs and the consumption of a ketogenic diet. More well-designed and long-term studies are necessary for greater evidence of these changes and the impact they may have on the health of children and adults, including exclusion diets in healthy children and/or adolescents. Supplementing these diets with probiotics and prebiotics could help the modulation of IM avoiding dysbiosis, mainly in certain pathological situations."
"Features of Gut Microbiome Associated With Responses to Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review","Zhang J., Guo Y., Duan L.","Frontiers in Medicine","10.3389/fmed.2022.773105","9",NA,"2022","Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been seen as a novel treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The results on microbial alterations and their relationship to treatment efficacy are varied among studies. We performed a systematic review to explore the association between microbial features and therapy outcomes. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to November 2020. Studies that investigated the efficacy of FMT and baseline microbial features or dynamic alteration of the microbiome during FMT were included. The methodological quality of the included cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Cochrane risk of bias tool, respectively. A total of 30 studies were included in the analysis. Compared to non-responders, the microbial structure of patients who responded to FMT had a higher similarity to that of their donors after FMT. Donors of responders (R-d) and non-responders (NR-d) had different microbial taxa, but the results were inconsistent. After FMT, several beneficial short-chain fatty acids- (SCFA-) producing taxa, such as Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium, Roseburia, and species belonging to them, were enriched in responders, while pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Escherichia-Shigella) belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria were decreased. Alterations of microbial functional genes and metabolites were also observed. In conclusion, the response to FMT was associated with the gut microbiota and their metabolites. The pre-FMT microbial features of recipients, the comparison of pre- and post-FMT microbiota, and the relationship between recipients and donors at baseline should be further investigated using uniform and standardized methods."

In this study we address potential limitations of operating room heterogeneity of infections and compliance with behavioral interventions following adoption into clinical practice. Design: A post-implementation prospective case-cohort study. Setting: Twenty-three operating rooms at a large teaching hospital. Patients: A total of 801 surgical patients [425 (53%) women; 350 (44%) ASA > 2, age 54.6 ± 15.9 years] were analyzed for the primary and 804 for the secondary outcomes. Interventions: A multifaceted, evidence-based intraoperative infection control program involving hand hygiene, vascular care, and environmental cleaning improvements was implemented for 23 operating room environments. Bacterial transmission monitoring was used to provide monthly feedback for intervention optimization. Measurements: S. aureus transmission (primary) and surgical site infection (secondary). Materials and methods: The incidence of S. aureus transmission and surgical site infection before (3.5 months) and after (4.5 months) infection control optimization was assessed. Optimization was defined by a sustained reduction in anesthesia work area bacterial reservoir isolate counts. Poisson regression with robust error variances was used to estimate the incidence risk ratio (IRR) of intraoperative S. aureus transmission and surgical site infection for the independent variable of optimization. Main results: Optimization was associated with decreased S. aureus transmission [24% before (85/357) to 9% after (42/444), IRR 0.39, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.56, P <.001] and surgical site infections [8% before (29/360) and 3% after (15/444) (IRR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.77, P =.005; adjusted for American Society of Anesthesiologists' physical status, aIRR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.82, P =.009]. Conclusion: An optimized intraoperative infection control program targeting improvements in basic preventive measures is an effective and feasible approach for reducing S. aureus transmission and surgical site infection development."

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials","Peters V., Dijkstra G., Campmans-Kuijpers M.J.E.","Nutrition Reviews","10.1093/nutrit/nuab062","80","5","2022","Context: Conflicting practice-based dietary recommendations are sometimes given to patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); whereas intake of fiber should increase during remission, it should be avoided during relapse. Moreover, European countries set daily requirements of total fiber and do not specify any types. Objective: This systematic review appraised data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of the types of fibers beneficial for patients in the treatment of IBD to guide dietary fiber advice. Data Sources: The PubMED database was searched following PRISMA guidelines. Data Extraction: RCTs evaluating the effects of any type of fiber on clinical and physiological outcomes in patients with IBD were assessed. Quality assessment of the selected full-text articles was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Data Analysis: Eight studies were included reporting on 5 types of fibers. In 2 RCTs, germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) was shown to lower pro-inflammatory cytokines and clinical disease activity scores. Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) were demonstrated to lower IBD Questionnaire scores (lower well-being), in contrast to inulin, which decreased disease activity scores. An RCT could not find lower remission rates in the psyllium treatment group, while another RCT reported that administration led to less symptoms in patients. In RCTs, no concrete evidence was found that wheat bran improves disease course. Conclusions: Although the evidence is sparse, GBF and inulin seem propitious and merit further exploration. Evidence on wheat bran and psyllium is still too limited. Adequately powered long-term human RCTs with objective outcomes are needed to improve dietary advice on types of fiber in IBD."

Aims: We aimed to systematically review the efficacy and safety of medical interventions for the prevention and treatment of ICI-associated enterocolitis. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort and case–control studies, and case series/reports, evaluating interventions (including corticosteroids, biologics, aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, and fecal transplantation) for ICI-associated enterocolitis. Clinical, endoscopic, and histologic efficacy endpoints were evaluated. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria were used to assess overall quality of evidence. Results: A total of 160 studies (n = 1514) were included (one RCT, 3 retrospective cohort studies, 156 case reports/case series). Very low quality evidence from one RCT suggests budesonide is not effective for prevention of ICI-associated enterocolitis in ipilimumab-treated patients (relative risk 0.93 [95% confidence interval 0.56, 1.56]). Very low quality evidence suggests that corticosteroids, infliximab, and vedolizumab may be effective for treatment of ICI-associated enterocolitis by inducing clinical response and remission. No validated indices for measuring disease activity were used. Biologic treatment was used in 42% (641/1528) of patients, as reported in 97 studies. ICIs were discontinued in 65% (457/702) of patients, as reported in 63 studies. Conclusions: Current treatment recommendations for ICI-associated enterocolitis are based on very low quality evidence, primarily from case reports and case series. Large-scale prospective cohort studies and RCTs are needed to develop prophylactic and therapeutic treatments to minimize interruption or discontinuation of oncological therapies."
"COPD and Gut–Lung Axis: How Microbiota and Host Inflammasome Influence COPD and Related Therapeutics","Qu L., Cheng Q., Wang Y., Mu H., Zhang Y.","Frontiers in Microbiology","10.3389/fmicb.2022.868086","13",NA,"2022","The exact pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains largely unknown. While current management strategies are effective at stabilizing the disease or relief the symptoms, new approaches are required to target underlying disease process and reverse lung function deterioration. Recent research showed that pneumonia bacteria is critical in disease progression and gut microbiome is likely perturbed in COPD, which is usually accompanied by a decreased intestinal microbial diversity and a disturbance in immune system, contributing to a chronic inflammation. The cross-talk between gut microbes and lungs, termed as the “gut-lung axis,” is known to impact immune response and homeostasis in the airway. Although the gut and respiratory microbiota exhibit compositional differences, the gut and lung showed similarities in the origin of epithelia of both gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, the anatomical structure, and early-life microbial colonization. Evidence showed that respiratory infection might be prevented, or at least dampened by regulating gut microbial ecosystem; thus, a promising yet understudied area of COPD management is nutrition-based preventive strategies. COPD patient is often deficient in nutrient such as antioxidant, vitamins, and fiber intake. However, further larger-scale randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are required to establish the role of these nutrition-based diet in COPD management. In this review, we highlight the important and complex interaction of microbiota and immune response on gut-lung axis. Further research into the modification and improvement of the gut microbiota and new interventions through diet, probiotics, vitamins, and fecal microbiota transplantation is extreme critical to provide new preventive therapies for COPD."
"The Microbiome and Uremic Solutes","Zaidan N., Nazzal L.","Toxins","10.3390/toxins14040245","14","4","2022","Uremic retention solutes, especially the protein-bound compounds, are toxic metabolites, difficult to eliminate with progressive renal functional decline. They are of particular interest because these uremic solutes are responsible for the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases. Evidence suggests that the relation between uremic toxins, the microbiome, and its host is altered in patients with chronic kidney disease, with the colon’s motility, epithelial integrity, and absorptive properties also playing an important role. Studies found an alteration of the microbiota composition with differences in species proportion, diversity, and function. Since uremic toxins precursors are generated by the microbiota, multiple therapeutic options are currently being explored to address dysbiosis. While an oral adsorbent can decrease the transport of bacterial metabolites from the intestinal lumen to the blood, dietary measures, supplements (prebiotics, probiotics, and synbi-otics), and antibiotics aim to target directly the gut microbiota composition. Innovative approaches, such as the modulation of bacterial enzymes, open new perspectives to decrease the plasma level of uremic toxins."

Elevated serum phosphorus levels are an important nontraditional risk factor for bone mineral disease and CVD in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Given that phosphorus concentrations drive other disorders associated with increased CV risk (e.g., endothelial dysfunction, vascular calcification, fibroblast growth factor-23, parathyroid hormone), phosphate is a logical target to improve CV health. Phosphate binders are the only pharmacologic treatment approved for hyperphosphatemia. Although their safety has improved since inception, the mechanism of action leads to characteristics that make ingestion difficult and unpleasant; large pill size, objectionable taste, and multiple pills required for each meal and snack make phosphate binders a burden. Side effects, especially those affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) system, are common with binders, often leading to treatment discontinuation. The presence of “hidden” phosphates in processed foods and certain medications makes phosphate management even more challenging. Owing to these significant issues, most patients on dialysis are not consistently achieving and maintaining target phosphorus concentrations of <5.5 mg/dl, let alone more normal levels of <4.5 mg/dl, indicating novel approaches to improve phosphate management and CV health are needed. Several new nonbinder therapies that target intestinal phosphate absorption pathways have been developed. These include EOS789, which acts on the transcellular pathway, and tenapanor, which targets the dominant paracellular pathway. As observational evidence has established a strong association between phosphorus concentration and clinical outcomes, such as mortality, phosphate is an important target for improving the health of patients with CKD and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)."

Diet and antibiotics are known modulators of GM, but the influence of physical exercise in modulating the diversity and abundance of hindgut bacteria is still poorly understood. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the scientific evidence about the effect of physical exercise on GM modulation in subjects with obesity and T2DM. Methods and results: A search in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane and Embase databases using keywords related to gut microbiota, physical exercise and metabolic diseases was performed. Eight clinical studies met the inclusion criteria, six in subjects with obesity and two in individuals with T2DM. In three studies carried out in individuals with obesity, exercise was able to positively modulate the diversity of GM and the abundance of some species of bacteria, mostly by increasing the Bifidobacteriaceae family, and the Bacteroides and Akkermansia genera, and by decreasing the Proteobacteria phylum. The studies in subjects with T2DM found that physical exercise may reduce metabolic endotoxemia markers. Conclusions: Physical exercise may be a beneficial modulation strategy of GM composition in metabolic diseases, specifically aerobic exercises carried out for at least 6 weeks with moderate or high intensity. Nevertheless, well-designed clinical trials are needed to clarify the role of physical exercise on GM in subjects with obesity and T2DM."

As an initial step toward creating a validated instrument, we identified pouchitis disease activity indices, examined their operating properties, and assessed their value as outcome measures in clinical trials. Methods: Electronic databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials including indices that evaluated clinical, endoscopic, or histologic pouchitis disease activity. A second search identified studies that assessed the operating properties of pouchitis indices. Results: Eighteen randomized controlled trials utilizing 4 composite pouchitis disease activity indices were identified. The Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) was most commonly used (12 of 18; 66.7%) to define both trial eligibility (8 of 12; 66.7%), and outcome measures (12 of 12; 100%). In a separate search, 21 studies evaluated the operating properties of 3 pouchitis indices; 90.5% (19 of 21) evaluated validity, of which 42.1% (8 of 19) evaluated the construct validity of the PDAI. Criterion validity (73.7%; 14 of 19) was evaluated through correlation of the PDAI with fecal calprotectin (FCP; r=0.188 to 0.71), fecal lactoferrin (r=0.570 to 0.582), and C-reactive protein (CRP; r=0.584). Two studies assessed correlation of the modified PDAI (mPDAI) with FCP (r=0.476 and r=0.565, respectively). Fair to moderate inter-rater reliability of the PDAI (k=0.440) and mPDAI (k=0.389) was reported in a single study. Responsiveness of the PDAI pre-antibiotic and postantibiotic treatment was partially evaluated in a single study of 12 patients. Conclusions: Development and validation of a specific pouchitis disease activity index is needed given that existing instruments are not valid, reliable, or responsive."

Acute-on-chronic failure liver (ACLF) is a severe syndrome that affects the liver due to acute decompensation in patients with chronic liver disease. An infection environment, ascites, increased liver enzymes and prothrombin time, encephalopathy and fast-evolving multiorgan failure, leading to death, usually accompany this. The pathophysiology remains poorly understand. In this context, animal models become a very useful tool in this regard, as understanding; the disease may be helpful in developing novel therapeutic methodologies for ACLF. However, although animal models display several similarities to the human condition, they do not represent all ACLF manifestations, resulting in significant challenges. An initial liver cirrhosis framework followed by the induction of an acute decompensation by administering lipopolysaccharide and D-GaIN, potentiating liver damage supports the methodologies applied to induce experimental ACLF. The entire methodology has been described mostly for rats. Nevertheless, a quick PubMed database search indicates about 30 studies concerning ACFL models and over 1000 regarding acute liver failure models. These findings demonstrate the clear need to establish easily reproducible ACFL models to elucidate questions about this quickly established and often fatal syndrome."

Despite the high value of incorporating FMT into practice, there remain concerns about its safety. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been an updated meta-analysis reporting pooled rates of adverse events in FMT for CDI. Methods A search for studies of FMT in patients with CDI was performed with the rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) related to FMT evaluated as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included SAEs unrelated to FMT and minor adverse events associated with FMT. A pooled analysis was then performed. Results Initial search identified 378 reference articles. Data were extracted from the 61 of these studies that met the inclusion criteria, comprising 5099 patients. Pooled analysis showed that SAEs related to FMT developed in less than 1% of patients. The pooled rate of SAEs not related to FMT was higher at 2.9%. The pooled rate of minor adverse events also showed infrequent self-limited gastrointestinal and systemic discomfort. Conclusions This meta-analysis supports FMT as a safe option for treating recurrent CDI. Future randomized trials are needed to improve our current understanding of FMT safety and further examine the improvements in the quality of life of patients treated with FMT compared to standard therapy of antibiotics."

Prediagnostic and prodromal features, such as constipation and α-synuclein pathology, can be detected several years before the clinical diagnosis of PD and have the potential to develop as early PD biomarkers. Environmental toxins and gut dysbiosis may trigger oxidative stress and mucosal inflammation, and initiate α-synuclein accumulation in the enteric nervous system, early in PD. Chronic gut inflammation can lead to a leaky gut and systemic inflammation, neuro inflammation, and neuro degeneration via gut–vagus–brain signaling or through blood–brain barrier permeability. Concepts regarding the gut–brain signaling in PD pathogenesis are changing rapidly and more investigation is required. The gut microbiota interacts with the human body by modulating the enteric and central nervous systems, and immune activity. Understanding the immune responses between gut microbiota and human body might help in elucidating the PD pathogenesis. As changes in gut microbiota composition might be associated with different clinical phenotypes of PD, gut microbiota-modulating interventions, such as probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), have the potential to restore the gut dysbiosis, reduce inflammation, and possibly modulate the clinical PD phenotype."

The prevalence of GC among the younger population has been increasing in recent years, and the latter is associated with late detection and advanced disease status. The factors involved in the development of GC have been the focus of investigation in the past few years; yet no consistent conclusions or preventative solutions have been suggested. This scoping review aims to explore and report on research studies conducted to investigate the association between GC, the gut microbiome, and nutritional habits. Recent findings : Using a predefined protocol in compliance with the PRISMA guidelines, a search was conducted on four separate databases including Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, ProQuest, and PubMed to investigate the association between GC, microbiome, and nutrition. A total of 1219 articles were identified through this process. Forty-three articles met the initial screening criteria and following full-article analysis, and 10 articles met the full inclusion criteria and were included in the current review. The results of the study support that there are differences in the gut microbiota between GC patients and healthy controls and that GC patients may have increased microbiota richness and lower diversity compared to healthy controls. In addition, the detection of pre/early GC may be possible through the analysis of the microbiota using fecal sampling. Nutritional habits, probiotics, and antibiotics may also play an important role in affecting GC development. Summary: Preliminary studies support a role for the gut microbiota in developing GC. Yet, the lack of sufficient randomized controlled studies investigating the association between GC, the gut microbiota, and nutritional habits demonstrates the need for further clinical research to develop preventative strategies that will aim to reduce the increased incidence of GC among all age groups including younger populations."

Pain in pediatric age is characterized by relevant health and socio-economic consequences due to parental concern, medicalization, and long-term physical and psychological impact in children. Pathophysiological mechanisms of nociception include several pathways in which also individual perception and gut-brain axis seem to be involved. In this narrative review, we analyze the rational and the current clinical findings of probiotic use in the management of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in pediatric age, with special focus on infantile colic, irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, and gastroesophageal reflux. Some specific probiotics showed a significant reduction in crying and fussing compared to placebo in breastfed infants with colic, although their exact mechanism of action in this disorder remains poorly understood. In irritable bowel syndrome, a limited number of studies showed that specific strains of probiotics can improve abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating/gassiness, although data are still scarce. As for constipation, whilst some strains appear to reduce the number of hard stools in constipated children, the evidence is not adequate to support the use of probiotics in the management of functional constipation. Similarly, although some probiotic strains could promote gastric emptying with a potential improvement of functional symptoms related to gastroesophageal reflux, current evidence is insufficient to provide any specific recommendation for the prevention or treatment of gastroesophageal reflux. In conclusion, probiotics have been proposed as part of management of pain in functional gastrointestinal disorders in pediatric age, but mechanisms are still poorly understood and evidence to guide clinical practice is currently inadequate."

Two independent reviewers carried out a systematic evaluation of the existing literature in South Africa on environmental and occupational exposures, as well as the health effects faced by informal street food vendors. Methods: 354 published publications were reviewed and 9 were included, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: The evidence showed that informal street vendors are exposed to workplace risks that affect their health and wellbeing. Non-enclosed vendor stalls and frequent use of open fires were among the risk concerns. Vendors are vulnerable to gastrointestinal diseases such as salmonellosis and respiratory infections such as influenza and COVID-19 due to inadequate access to water, waste disposal facilities, and basic hygiene awareness and practices. Exposure to air pollutants increased the risk of respiratory and urinary illnesses and an impact on the reproductive health of female street vendors. Conclusions: This investigation demonstrated the difficulties in complying with the requirements of the Regulations Governing General Hygiene Requirements for Food Premises, the Transport of Food, and Related Matters (no. R638 of 22 June 2018) and the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Act (no. 85 of 1993). Within South African borders, there is a scarcity of research on occupational exposures and health effects in this occupation. As a result, eliminating or preventing these occupational exposures should be at the top of government and stakeholder agendas. The majority of the research was carried out in KwaZulu Natal and used a quantitative, cross-sectional technique. Other designs, including cohorts, time series, and randomized intervention trials, were underutilized."

Recently, ultraviolet (UV) light and hydrogen peroxide have increasingly been used as innovative decontamination methods. Hence, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate which decontamination methods are effective in reducing environmental C. difficile contamination. We systematically searched the EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Ichushi until March 11, 2021. We evaluated the efficacy of decontamination methods in terms of the frequency of C. difficile contamination on high-touch surfaces in hospital rooms and the incidence of hospital-acquired C. difficile infection. Among the 15 studies retrieved in our meta-analysis, eight evaluated decontamination methods with the frequency of C. difficile detection among samples after disinfection procedures, and eight reported the number of hospital-acquired CDI cases. Pooled analysis indicated that hydrogen peroxide significantly reduced the frequency of environmental C. difficile contamination, compared with hypochlorite (odds ratios [OR]: 0.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07–0.23). Additionally, hydrogen peroxide reduced the incidence of hospital-acquired CDI compared to other methods (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.28–0.96). Decontamination with UV significantly reduced the incidence of hospital-acquired CDI compared to hypochlorite (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28–0.96). The use of hydrogen peroxide and UV can help prevent environmental C. difficile contamination and transmission in healthcare facilities."
"Food, water, and sanitation insecurities: Complex linkages and implications for achieving WASH security","Workman C.L., Stoler J., Harris A., Ercumen A., Kearns J., Mapunda K.M.","Global Public Health","10.1080/17441692.2021.1971735","17","11","2022","Food, water and sanitation insecurities are complex, multi-dimensional phenomena that entail more than availability and access; food, water, and sanitation resources must be safe and culturally appropriate. Researchers and implementers concerned with these insecurities have demonstrated that there are notable interactions between them resulting in significant psychological and biological outcomes. Recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in Bangladesh, Kenya (WASH Benefits) and Zimbabwe (SHINE) demonstrated no effect from water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions on linear growth, and mixed evidence on enteropathogen burden and risk of diarrhoea in young children. These data suggest a need for a more comprehensive understanding of WASH security. The risks posed by multiple resource insecurities shift depending on the individual, their movement throughout their day, their economically and socially prescribed roles, and ecological features such as seasonality and precipitation. By more fully integrating food, water and sanitation security in interventions and subsequent impact evaluations, we can achieve WASH security—one that addresses myriad transmission pathways and co-occurring diseases—that ultimately would improve health outcomes throughout the world. In this critical review, we outline the complexity of combined resource insecurities as a step towards transformative WASH."
"Impact of different pathogen reduction technologies on the biochemistry, function, and clinical effectiveness of platelet concentrates: An updated view during a pandemic","Escolar G., Diaz-Ricart M., McCullough J.","Transfusion","10.1111/trf.16747","62","1","2022","Standard platelet concentrates (PCs) stored at 22°C have a limited shelf life of 5 days. Because of the storage temperature, bacterial contamination of PCs can result in life-threatening infections in transfused patients. The potential of blood components to cause infections through contaminating pathogens or transmitting blood-borne diseases has always been a concern. The current safety practice to prevent pathogen transmission through blood transfusion starts with a stringent screening of donors and regulated testing of blood samples to ensure that known infections cannot reach transfusion products. Pathogen reduction technologies (PRTs), initially implemented to ensure the safety of plasma products, have been adapted to treat platelet products. In addition to reducing bacterial contamination, PRT applied to PCs can extend their shelf life up to 7 days, alleviating the impact of their shortage, while providing an additional safety layer against emerging blood-borne infectious diseases. While a deleterious action of PRTs in quantitative and qualitative aspects of plasma is accepted, the impact of PRTs on the quality, function, and clinical efficacy of PCs has been under constant examination. The potential of PRTs to prevent the possibility of new emerging diseases to reach cellular blood components has been considered more hypothetical than real. In 2019, a coronavirus-related disease (COVID-19) became a pandemic. This episode should help when reconsidering the possibility of future blood transmissible threats. The following text intends to evaluate the impact of different PRTs on the quality, function, and clinical effectiveness of platelets within the perspective of a developing pandemic."
"Efficacy and appropriateness of novel antibiotics in response to antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacteria in patients with sepsis in the ICU","Garduno A., Martín-Loeches I.","Expert Review of Anti-Infective Therapy","10.1080/14787210.2022.1999804","20","4","2022","Introduction: There is an ever-increasing range of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that have led to higher community-acquired infections, and substantial mortality rates in critically ill patients. Areas covered: We have critically appraised available evidence through a structured literature review, investigating effective empiric antibiotic administration and appropriateness on outcomes of critically ill patients with an increased risk of developing resistant pathogens. The use of new antibiotics should be determined based on relevant knowledge of their spectrum and properties to provide effective mode of action for critically ill patients. Expert Opinion: Restricting severely ill patients access to new broad-spectrum empirical drugs is not the answer. Rather there should be a focus on identifying host response to infection to differentiate between colonization or contamination and true infection, and the sensitivity to antibiotics used in the intensive care unit (ICU). Management relies on adequate antibiotic administration, the ability to monitor response, and facilitate the cessation of antibiotic treatment. The major determinant of patient success in a patient with a severe infection is the ‘right’ antibiotic or complementary course of treatment. As an overarching criterion, the following three appropriate “Ds” should be considered: Dosing, Duration, and De-escalation to empirically assess the right antibiotic optimal antimicrobial selection."

Study design: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating nonpharmacologic treatments in children with functional constipation which reported at least 1 outcome of the core outcome set for children with functional constipation. Results: We included 52 RCTs with 4668 children, aged between 2 weeks and 18 years, of whom 47% were females. Studied interventions included gut microbiome-directed interventions, other dietary interventions, oral supplements, pelvic floor-directed interventions, electrical stimulation, dry cupping, and massage therapy. An overall high risk of bias was found across the majority of studies. Meta-analyses for treatment success and/or defecation frequency, including 20 RCTs, showed abdominal electrical stimulation (n = 3), Cassia Fistula emulsion (n = 2), and a cow's milk exclusion diet (n = 2 in a subpopulation with constipation as a possible manifestation of cow's milk allergy) may be effective. Evidence from RCTs not included in the meta-analyses, indicated that some prebiotic and fiber mixtures, Chinese herbal medicine (Xiao'er Biantong granules), and abdominal massage are promising therapies. In contrast, studies showed no benefit for the use of probiotics, synbiotics, an increase in water intake, dry cupping, or additional biofeedback or behavioral therapy. We found no RCTs on physical movement or acupuncture. Conclusions: More well-designed high quality RCTs concerning nonpharmacologic treatments for children with functional constipation are needed before changes in current guidelines are indicated."

The aim of our work was to systematically evaluate the frequency of adverse events related to dronabinol or nabilone treatment compared to placebo. Scientific databases were searched for placebo-controlled clinical studies of patients receiving either dronabinol or nabilone therapy with placebo control groups. This meta-analysis was reported following the PRISMA guidelines using the PICO format, and it was registered with the PROSPERO register. There were 16 trials included in the meta-analysis. In the nabilone studies, drowsiness was more than 7 times as frequent in patients treated with nabilone than in the placebo group (OR: 7.25; 95% CI: 1.64-31.95), and the risk of dizziness (OR: 21.14; 95% CI: 2.92-152.75) and dry mouth was also higher (OR: 17.23; 95% CI: 4.33-68.55). The frequency of headache was not different in the two groups. In case of dronabinol, the frequency of dry mouth (OR: 5.58; 95% CI: 3.19-9.78), dizziness (OR: 4.60 95% CI: 2.39-8.83) and headache (OR: 2.90; 95% CI: 1.07-7.85) was significantly higher in the dronabinol groups, whereas in case of nausea, drowsiness and fatigue there was no difference. The severity of adverse events was typically mild-to-moderate and transient. In a risk-benefit assessment, these adverse effects are acceptable compared to the achievable benefit. However, considering the diversity of the adverse effects, more studies are needed to provide a more accurate assessment on the side effect profiles of these two compounds."

Genetic pre determinants and environmental factors including; stress, age, diet, geographical features, use of antibiotics, and more importantly gut microbiota (GM) are implicated in the development of IBS. In the present review, by using free search engines providing biomedical and clinical literature (Science Direct, PubMed, and Google Scholar) we have evaluated the association of GM and IBS and the role of human interventions such as probiotics, synbiotic, prebiotics, and the fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as potential therapeutic methods within the treatment of IBS. Current advances in molecular approaches have broadened our understanding of GM and the significant impact of microbial communities on human wellbeing. The imbalanced distribution of microbial communities resides in the human intestine (intestinal dysbiosis) has been associated with IBS development. Due to current challenges in the treatment of IBS, various manipulation of the GM as a new approach for IBS remedy has attracted much attention in recent years. Hence, scientific literature confirms that the manipulation of GM with prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic interventions as well as FMT can significantly improve the GM composition/balances and prevent negative effects of dysbiosis GM in patients with symptoms of IBS."

The emergence of these observations enabled to postulate a bacteria-centric paradigm to rethink the treatment of many diseases. The goal of therapy should not be to eradicate the flora but to modify it in a way that leads to symptomatic improvement; thus, the interest in the use of probiotics to modulate microbiota composition has increased worldwide in both community and healthcare settings. Summary: The results of published studies are conflicting for most probiotic strains and formulations, and clinicians and consumers need a better understanding of probiotic risks and benefits. Currently, clear guidelines on when to use probiotics and the most effective probiotic for different gastrointestinal conditions are still lacking. Here, we reviewed the studies on the use of probiotics in some diseases of relevant interest to gastroenterologists, such as Helicobacter pylori infection, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. Key Message: Although the evidence is relevant and promising for probiotics in general, and for specific strains and combinations of strains, it is not yet sufficient to draw unequivocal conclusions and clear recommendations."

However, the efficacy and safety of SBS in treating chronic diarrhea have not been fully assessed. Objective: This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of the herbal formula SBS in symptomatic relief of chronic diarrhea. Methods: English and Chinese language databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal Database, Wanfang Data, and SinoMed electronic databases) were searched through April 2020 for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The outcomes in these RCTs included stool frequency, stool consistency, patient-reported satisfaction of chronic diarrhea treatment, quality of life and adverse events. Paired reviewers independently extracted data and conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses. The Cochrane revised risk of bias RoB-2 tool was applied to assess the risk of bias for each trial whereas the RevMan 5.3 software was used for outcomes data synthesis and meta-analysis. Mean difference (MD) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to measure continuous data. The dichotomous data were analyzed via the relative risk (RR) with 95% CIs. Results: Fourteen RCTs including 1158 participants (54% males) with chronic diarrhea were included. Shenling Baizhu San combined with or without conventional medicine (CM) was associated with greater patient-reported satisfaction than CM alone. There was no increased risk of adverse events (AEs) during treatment. Conclusion: Treatment with SBS was associated with significant improvement in patient-reported satisfaction, irrespective of conventional medicine use. Rigorous and powered RCTs with objective outcome measures are needed to confirm the effects of SBS in specific gastrointestinal disease populations with chronic diarrhea symptoms.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic recurrent inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an emerging therapy that modifies the patient's gut microbiota by transplanting feces from a healthy donor to achieve disease remission. However, its efficacy and safety need to be further investigated. Methods. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar databases (up to 8th November 2021) were searched and literature was screened by title and abstract as well as full text. The primary outcome was clinical remission, with the clinical response as a secondary outcome. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. Results. A total of 14 trials were included in this study. In terms of clinical remission, FMT had a significant effect compared to placebo (RR = 1.44, 95 CI%: 1.03 to 2.02, I2 = 38%, P=0.03), with no significant risk of study heterogeneity. Moreover, FMT led to significant results in clinical response compared to placebo with moderate between-study heterogeneity (RR = 1.34, 95 CI%: 0.92 to 1.94, I2 = 51%, P=0.12). Subgroup analysis showed a higher clinical remission for fresh fecal FMT (40.9%) than that for frozen fecal FMT (32.2%); the efficacy of gastrointestinal (GI) pretreatment, the severity of disease, route of administration, and the donor selection remain unclear and require more extensive study. Safety analysis concluded that most adverse events were mild and self-resolving. The microbiological analysis found that the patient's gut microbiota varied in favor of the donor, with increased flora diversity and species richness. Conclusion. FMT is a safe, effective, and well-tolerated therapy. Studies have found that fresh fecal microbiota transplant can increase clinical remission rates. However, more randomized controlled trials and long-term follow-ups are needed to assess its long-term effectiveness and safety."

The resulting shared phenotype is one of hepatocellular cholestasis. Clinical management targeting refractory itch and surgical interventions to interrupt the enterohepatic circulation are often pursued with variable efficacy. Recent development of the family of IBAT inhibitor therapeutics has introduced a novel tool in the armamentarium for the treatment of PFIC. Areas covered: Data from Phase 3 and 3 clinical trials were reviewed. The primary endpoints in most studies included effect on pruritus, serum bile acid levels, and quality of life metrics, with the duration of the study ranging between 24 and 72 weeks. Most common adverse events included diarrhea, vomiting, and elevation in transaminases. Expert opinion: IBAT inhibition with therapeutics such as odevibixat have shown that it is well-tolerated and efficacious in mitigating itch and reducing serum bile acid levels. While the few early published trials with odevixibat have shown good efficacy, what remains to be seen is long-term, sustainable improvement and if or how these medications will supplement or replace the current medical and surgical therapies available for managing PFIC disorders."

Currently, no single strategy provides complete protection or is universally effective across all demographic groups at risk for HIV. However, HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the newest HIV prevention strategy that shows promise. To date, two products have received an indication for PrEP by Health Canada: emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada®; FTC/TDF) and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Descovy®; FTC/TAF). Despite the high efficacy of these PrEP intervention methods, access to PrEP in Canada remains low. Identifying and addressing barriers to PrEP access, especially in high-risk groups, are necessary to reduce HIV transmission in Canada. While guidelines published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) include FTC/TAF information, the efficacy of FTC/TAF for PrEP has not yet been considered in Canada's clinical practice guidelines. Thus, the current paper reviews data regarding the use of FTC/TDF and FTC/TAF for PrEP, which may be useful for Canadian healthcare providers when counseling and implementing HIV prevention methods. The authors highlight these data in relation to various at-risk populations and review ongoing clinical trials investigating novel PrEP agents. Overall, FTC/TDF PrEP is effective for many populations, including men who have sex with men, transgender women, heterosexuals with partners living with HIV, and people who use drugs. While there is fewer data reported on the efficacy of FTC/TAF to date, recent clinical trials have demonstrated noninferiority of FTC/TAF in comparison to FTC/TDF. Notably, as studies have shown that FTC/TAF maintains renal function and bone mineral density to a greater extent than FTC/TDF, FTC/TAF may be a safer option for patients experiencing renal and/or bone dysfunction, for those at risk of renal and bone complications, and for those who develop FTC/TDF-related adverse events."

Additionally, sustained corticosteroid (CS) free remission is warranted to prevent drug related side effects. In clinical trials, long-term efficacy of treatment is assessed by a range of outcome measures at variable time points. Besides clinical activity, it is recommended by the EMA to measure biochemical and endoscopic activity, given the poor correlation between commonly applied clinical activity indices and mucosal inflammation. Finally, STRIDE advices to add a PROM given the frequent perception gap in disease control between patient and health care professionals. Moreover, the relapsing-remitting nature of CD challenges timing of efficacy evaluations. Use of cross-sectional outcomes only on predetermined moments disregards the health status in between these measurements. In this systematic review, we provide an overview of the outcomes employed to assess long-term efficacy of maintenance (drug) therapy or treatment strategies in randomized controlled trials and their open label extensions in CD patients. Methods: A systematic search of Pubmed and Embase databases was performed. Giving the emerging treatment goals, the search was restricted to trials published since 2007. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts and selected eligible trials. We assessed whether and when long-term (i.e. >48 weeks) clinical, biochemical and/or endoscopic efficacy outcomes were used. In addition, data on patient perspective and CS use were collected. Results: Sixty-seven out of 1947 articles were included (figure 1). Clinical activity indices were used in 66 studies (99%) as long-term efficacy outcome, with 20 studies (30%) taking into account concomitant CS use. C-reactive protein concentration was (part of) an outcome in 29 studies (43%), and faecal calprotectin in 15 studies (22%). Endoscopic activity was evaluated in 30 studies (45%). PROMs were used in 29 studies (43%), with IBDQ being the most frequently used. Seven studies measure long-term clinical, biochemical, endoscopic activity and patient perspective, in three studies a sustained CS free status as part of the outcome was required (table 1). In most studies cross-sectional measures or multiple measurements over time, so-called panel data, were used. Conclusion: We established a lack of objective outcome measures of inflammation and patient perspective in clinical trials in CD, consequently missing pivotal data to evaluate current treatment goals. Additionally, cross-sectional outcomes on fixed time points were mostly applied, resulting in loss of efficacy information in chronic relapsing-remitting diseases."

In bacteremia, this pathogen is associated with higher mortality than other Gram-negative pathogens. This increase in mortality was also found globally for multi-resistant compared to susceptible strains. Several factors have been associated with the development of resistance: previous ICU stay, use of carbapenems, and comorbidities were identified in multivariate analysis. In the therapeutic choice, previous antibiotic treatment remains the strongest driver suggesting a potential resistant strain. These risk factors will decide whether multi-resistant strains must be considered in the empiric coverage. For susceptible strains, a single agent can be used, β-lactams are usually the first choice. Associations do not provide any advantage on mortality. Optimization of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters, such as prolonged infusion (for time-dependent antibiotics), increased dosage (for concentration-dependent antibiotics), and therapeutic drug monitoring, also influences the outcome. The increasing number of resistant strains led the clinician to use either recently approved new molecules but also associations. For multi-resistant strains, new molecules such as ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, and cefiderocol have shown an adequate activity against P. aeruginosa. Older molecules like colistin and fosfomycin are also used in this indication. The complexity of the resistance and consequences on a larger scale of antibiotic prescription will probably lead to more individualized prescriptions."

"Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces in hospitals and long-term care facilities for reducing hospital and facility-acquired bacterial and viral infections: A systematic review","Thomas R.E., Thomas B.C., Conly J., Lorenzetti D.","medRxiv","10.1101/2021.12.22.21268185",NA,NA,"2021","Background: Multiply drug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in hospitals and long-term care facilities (LTCFs) of particular concern include meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter species and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing organisms. Respiratory viruses include influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Aim: To assess effectiveness of cleaning and disinfecting surfaces in hospitals and LTCFs. Methods: CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Medline, and Scopus searched inception to 28 June 2021, no language restrictions, for randomized controlled trials, cleaning, disinfection, hospitals, LTCFs. Abstracts and titles were assessed and data abstracted independently by two authors. Findings: Of fourteen c-RCTs in hospitals and LTCFs, interventions in ten were focused on reducing patient infections of four MDROs and/or healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). In four c-RCTs patient MDRO and/or HAI rates were significantly reduced with cleaning and disinfection strategies including bleach, quaternary ammonium detergents, ultraviolet irradiation, hydrogen peroxide vapour and copper-treated surfaces or fabrics. Of three c-RCTs focused on reducing MRSA rates, one had significant results and one on Clostridioides difficile had no significant results. Heterogeneity of populations, methods, outcomes and data reporting precluded meta-analysis. Overall risk of bias assessment was low but high for allocation concealment, and GRADE assessment was low risk. No study assessed biofilms. Conclusions: Ten c-RCTs focused on reducing multiple MDROs and/or HAIs and four had significant reductions. Three c-RCTs reported only patient MRSA colonization rates (one significant reductions), and one focused on Clostridioides difficile (no significant differences). Standardised primary and secondary outcomes are required for future c-RCTs including detailed biofilm cleaning/disinfection interventions."
"Interventions for treating distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in cystic fibrosis","Gilchrist F.J., Green J., Carroll W.","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","10.1002/14651858.CD012798.pub3","2021","12","2021","Background: Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive genetic disorder in white populations. Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) is an important morbidity in cystic fibrosis. It is the result of the accumulation of viscid faecal material within the bowel which combines with thick, sticky mucus produced in the intestines of people with cystic fibrosis. The intestine may be completely blocked (complete DIOS) or only partially blocked (incomplete DIOS). Once a diagnosis of DIOS has been made, the goal of therapy is to relieve the acute complete or incomplete faecal obstruction and ultimately prevent the need for surgical intervention. Objectives: This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different treatment regimens for the treatment of DIOS (complete and incomplete) in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of search: 09 September 2021. We also searched online trial registries. Date of last search: 12 October 2021. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials (including cross-over trials (to be judged on an individual basis)) comparing the use of laxative agents or surgery for treating DIOS in children, young people and adults with cystic fibrosis to each other, placebo or no intervention. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed for risk of bias. The authors assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. Main results: There was one trial with 20 participants (16 females) included in the review. The mean age of participants was 13.1 years. The trial was a double-blinded, randomised cross-over trial which had a duration of 12 months in total and compared high-dose and low-dose pancreatic enzyme therapy. As only the abstract of the trial was available, the overall risk of bias was judged to be unclear. The trial did not address either of our primary outcomes (time until resolution of DIOS and treatment failure rate), but reported episodes of acute DIOS, presence of abdominal mass and abdominal pain. There were no numerical data available for these outcomes, but the authors stated that there was no difference between treatment with high-dose or low-dose pancreatic enzymes. The overall certainty of the evidence was found to be very low. Authors' conclusions: There is a clear lack of evidence for the treatment of DIOS in people with cystic fibrosis. The included abstract did not address our primary outcome measures and did not provide numerical data for the two secondary outcomes it did address. Therefore, we cannot justify the use of high-dose pancreatic enzymes for treating DIOS, nor can we comment on the efficacy and safety of other laxative agents. From our findings, it is clear that more randomised controlled trials need to be conducted in this area."
"Alcohol Use and Abuse Conspires With HIV Infection to Aggravate Intestinal Dysbiosis and Increase Microbial Translocation in People Living With HIV: A Review","Yan J., Ouyang J., Isnard S., Zhou X., Harypursat V., Routy J.-P., Chen Y.","Frontiers in Immunology","10.3389/fimmu.2021.741658","12",NA,"2021","The intestinal microbiome is an essential so-called human “organ”, vital for the induction of innate immunity, for metabolizing nutrients, and for maintenance of the structural integrity of the intestinal barrier. HIV infection adversely influences the richness and diversity of the intestinal microbiome, resulting in structural and functional impairment of the intestinal barrier and an increased intestinal permeability. Pathogens and metabolites may thus cross the “leaky” intestinal barrier and enter the systemic circulation, which is a significant factor accounting for the persistent underlying chronic inflammatory state present in people living with HIV (PLWH). Additionally, alcohol use and abuse has been found to be prevalent in PLWH and has been strongly associated with the incidence and progression of HIV/AIDS. Recently, converging evidence has indicated that the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is related to intestinal microbiome and barrier function through numerous pathways. Alcohol acts as a “partner” with HIV in disrupting microbiome ecology, and thus impairing of the intestinal barrier. Optimizing the microbiome and restoring the integrity of the intestinal barrier is likely to be an effective adjunctive therapeutic strategy for PLWH. We herein critically review the interplay among HIV, alcohol, and the gut barrier, thus setting the scene with regards to development of effective strategies to counteract the dysregulated gut microbiome and the reduction of microbial translocation and inflammation in PLWH."

Six in 10 people lacked access to safely managed sanitation facilities in 2015. Numerous community- and school-based approaches have been implemented to eradicate open defecation practices, promote latrine ownership, improve situation sanitation, and reduce waterborne disease. Objective: Given that current evidence for sanitation interventions seem promising, the aim of this study was to systematically summarize existing research on the effectiveness of community- and school-based randomized controlled sanitation intervention in improving (1) free open defecation (safe feces disposal), (2) latrine usage, (3) latrine coverage or access, and (4) improved latrine coverage or access. Methods: Eight electronic databases were searched: PubMed, Scopus, WHO Global Health Library (GHL), Virtual Health Library (VHL), POPLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar up to 26 April 2019. Original randomized clinical trials addressing community-based or school-based intervention that reported feces disposal and latrine coverage were deemed eligible. More than two researchers independently contributed to screening of papers, data extraction, and bias assessment. We conducted a meta-analysis by random-effects model. The risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: Eighteen papers that matched all criteria and 16 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Compared to the control, the sanitation intervention significantly increased safe feces disposal (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.51–3.19, p < 0.05, I(2) = 97.28), latrine usage (OR 3.72, 95% CI 1.71–8.11, p < 0.05, I(2) = 91.52), latrine coverage or access (OR 3.95, 95% CI 2.08–7.50, p < 0.05, I(2) = 99.07), and improved latrine coverage or access (OR 3.68, 95% CI 1.52–8.91, p < 0.05, I(2) = 99.11). A combination of education and latrine construction was more effective compared to educational intervention alone. Conclusion: Our study showed strong evidence for both community- and school-based sanitation interventions as effective for the safe disposal of human excreta. The finding suggests major implications for health policy and design of future intervention in developing countries."

"Fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridioides difficile, safety, and pitfalls","Sandhu A., Chopra T.","Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology","10.1177/17562848211053105","14",NA,"2021","Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infection attributing to substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. Recurrent CDI (rCDI) is common and occurs after effective treatment of first episode. Treatment of rCDI is based on accurate diagnoses, due to difficulty in distinguishing between colonization of C. difficile spores or CDI; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) added to the complexity of diagnoses as both entities can co-occur. It is difficult to eradicate rCDI, and there remains a critical gap regarding treatment of rCDI. The treatment goal of rCDI is to reestablish normal microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is suggested as a treatment for second episode of rCDI. Based on the collective evidence of all randomized controlled trials, FMT was reported more efficacious compared with vancomycin or fidaxomicin; however, these trials had limited number of patients and all patients were pre-treated with vancomycin prior to FMT. Furthermore, when comparing various routes of instillation and types of preparation of fecal microbiota, no difference was observed in cure rate. Despite the success rate of FMT, there remains a concern for transmission of infectious agents, such as Gram negative bacteremia or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), adverse events (diarrhea and abdominal pain), and reports of new diagnoses (inflammatory bowel disease, weight gain and irritable bowel syndrome). To lessen the risk of transmissible infections, donor screening should be performed, which includes screening for medical comorbidities and infectious pathogens in blood and feces. Scheduling complexities and reimbursement places an additional roadblock for using FMT. Microbiome-based therapies are being developed to eliminate the logistical challenges related to FMT. Large prospective and placebo-controlled studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and long-term safety of FMT, so its use can be justified in clinical practice."
"Gut microbiome and its role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome","De Palma G., Bercik P.","Acta Gastroenterologica Latinoamericana","10.52787/DXFC9250","51","4","2021","Summary Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder, affecting up to 9% individuals globally. Although the etiology of this syndrome is likely heterogenous, it presents with its hallmark symptoms of abdominal pain and altered intestinal motility. Moreover, it is considered to be a disorder of the gut-brain interaction, and the microbiome has often been implicated as a central player in its pathophysiology. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome display altered composition and function of the gut microbiota compared to healthy controls. Microbiome direct-ed therapies, such as probiotics, antibiotics and fecal micro-biome transplantation, appear to be beneficial for both gut symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities. This review aims to recapitulate the available literature on the microbiome con-tribution to the pathophysiology and symptoms presentation of irritable bowel syndrome, as well as the current literature on microbiome-targeted treatments for this disease."

The heightened interest is accompanied by concerns over adverse events (AE) and safety. To further understand that in FMT, we performed a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of high-quality, prospective randomized controlled trials FMT. Methods Studies were selected based on predefined exclusion criteria and were assessed for quality. Only prospective, randomized, controlled studies of high quality were included in the final analysis. Data were extracted on demographics, AE, indication, delivery method and follow-up duration. Results Out of 334 articles reviewed, 9 high quality studies with 756 FMTs were selected for final analysis. The pooled rate of AE was 39.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19-0.642) as they were reported by 112 patients who received FMT. The SAE rate was 5.3% (95%CI 3.1-8.8%). The most common AE reported was abdominal pain, followed by diarrhea. The most common SAE was Clostridium difficile infection. Upper gastrointestinal tract delivery was associated with a higher rate of total AE, but not SAE. Conclusions Based on the selected studies, the AE rate of FMT is 39.3%, with most AE being mild and self-limiting. SAE were uncommon at 5.3%, and many were only possibly related to the FMT. Adherence to standardized reporting of AE as well as longitudinal studies and registries will help further clarify the safety of FMT in the future."
"Fecal microbiome composition does not predict diet-induced tmao production in healthy adults","Ferrell M., Bazeley P., Wang Z., Levison B.S., Li X.S., Jia X., Krauss R.M., Knight R., Lusis A.J., Garcia-Garcia J.C., Hazen S.L., Wilson Tang W.H.","Journal of the American Heart Association","10.1161/JAHA.121.021934","10","21","2021","BACKGROUND: Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is a small molecule derived from the metabolism of dietary nutrients by gut microbes and contributes to cardiovascular disease. Plasma TMAO increases following consumption of red meat. This metabolic change is thought to be partly because of the expansion of gut microbes able to use nutrients abundant in red meat. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used data from a randomized crossover study to estimate the degree to which TMAO can be es-timated from fecal microbial composition. Healthy participants received a series of 3 diets that differed in protein source (red meat, white meat, and non-meat), and fecal, plasma, and urine samples were collected following 4 weeks of exposure to each diet. TMAO was quantitated in plasma and urine, while shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on fecal DNA. While the cai gene cluster was weakly correlated with plasma TMAO (rho=0.17, P=0.0007), elastic net models of TMAO were not improved by abundances of bacterial genes known to contribute to TMAO synthesis. A global analysis of all taxonomic groups, genes, and gene families found no meaningful predictors of TMAO. We postulated that abundances of known genes related to TMAO production do not predict bacterial metabolism, and we measured choline-and carnitine-trimethylamine lyase activity during fecal culture. Trimethylamine lyase genes were only weakly correlated with the activity of the enzymes they encode. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal microbiome composition does not predict systemic TMAO because, in this case, gene copy number does not predict bacterial metabolic activity.

Although IBS is a benign condition, it reduces the quality of life considerably. While there is currently no effective treatment for this disorder, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) seems to be promising. Purpose: The aim of this review was to analysis possible factors affecting the success or failure of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of FMT for IBS and highlighting the gaps in our knowledge that need to be filled and of sketching a possible model for successful FMT in IBS patients. Methods: A systematic search was conducted of literature published in English from January 2015 to December 2020 using the keywords: fecal microbiota transplantation, randomized trials, and IBS. Key Results: Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of FMT for IBS were found in the literature. Four of the seven RCTs found various positive effects, while the other three did not find any effect. Conclusions and Inferences: The efficacy of FMT for IBS appears to be donor-dependent. The effective (super) donor would need to have a favorable microbiota signature, and 11 clinical criteria that are known to be associated with a favorable microbiota have been suggested for selecting FMT donors for IBS. Comparing the microbiota of the effective donors with those of healthy subjects would reveal the favorable microbiota signature required for a super-donor. However, the studies reviewed were not designed to compare efficacy of different donor types. The dose of the fecal transplant is also an important factor influencing the outcome of FMT for IBS. However, further studies designed to test the effect of fecal transplant dose are needed to answer this question. Administering the fecal transplant to either the small or large intestine seems to be effective, but the optimal route of administration remains to be determined. Moreover, whether single or repeated FMT is more effective is also still unclear. A 1-year follow-up of IBS patients who received FMT showed that adverse events of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation were both mild and self-limiting."

LT success can be hampered by several short-term and long-term complications. Among them, bacterial infections, especially those due to multidrug-resistant germs, are particularly frequent, with a prevalence between 19 and 33% in the first 100 days after transplantation. In the last decades, a number of studies have highlighted how the gut microbiota (GM) is involved in several essential functions to ensure intestinal homeostasis, becoming one of the most important virtual metabolic organs. The GM works through different axes with other organs, and the gut-liver axis is among the most relevant and investigated ones. Any alteration or disruption of the GM is defined as dysbiosis. Peculiar phenotypes of GM dysbiosis have been associated with several liver conditions and complications, such as chronic hepatitis, fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, there is growing evidence of the crucial role of the GM in shaping the immune response, both locally and systemically, against pathogens. This paves the way to the manipulation of the GM as a therapeutic instrument to modulate infectious risk and outcome. In this minireview, we provide an overview of the current understanding of the interplay between the gut microbiota and the immune system in liver transplant recipients and the role of the former in infections."

Currently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) recommend metronidazole and/or vancomycin for pediatric CDI depending on disease severity. Recently however, the first and only RCT of CDI treatment in children demonstrated fidaxomicin to be non-inferior to vancomycin, proving its safety and efficacy in this population. Additionally, observational data published since the IDSA/SHEA guidelines were released suggest metronidazole has lower rates of clinical improvement when compared to vancomycin in hospitalized children with non-severe CDI. Given these recent publications, fidaxomicin and vancomycin, instead of metronidazole, appear to be more appropriate, evidence-based options for the treatment of CDI in children."

One of the compelling intervention to maintain healthy gut microbiota for better outcome of GVHD in HCT recipients is Fecal microbial transplantation(FMT). Several non randomized small clinical studies and case reports on the efficacy and safety of FMT were reported so far. However, the ultimate role of FMT as a therapeutic option to treat GVHD is yet to be determined due to lack of randomised, large scale, statistically significant studies. Here in, we report a systemic review of literature available so far in an effort to establish a definite role of FMT. Methodology: A systemic literature search was conducted using various electronic databases. The case reports, case series and clinical studies related to FMT were used as a therapeutic or preventative modality specifically for GVHD are included. Results: Upon pooling of data, 87 patients from 6 studies and 5 case reports were included in the study in which complete remission(CR) occured in 43.7% and partial remission(PR) occured in 20.7% patients which is equivalent to 64.4% overall response rate in treating GVHD. Furthermore, out of all the species in fecal matter, clostridium was found to be the most valuable species in decreasing the rates of GVHD re-occurrence. Only a limited number of patients had treatment-related mortality (TRM) from GVHD while few showed mild GI-related (abdominal pain/distention, nausea, regurgitation) and non-GI adverse reactions including infections, anemia, thrombocytopenia, paroxysmal, and atrial fibrillation. We emphasize that the most of the patients did not have any major complications after FMT. Conclusion: We conclude that the FMT is a safe and effective strategy for the management of GVHD based on our study. The establishment of gut diversity along with the patient's intrinsic factors like fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) secretor status and baseline gut microbial diversity play a major role in the success of FMT. Given the restricted size and absence of randomized data, one cannot portray FMT as a standard of care yet, however, the low or absent toxicity along with improvement in survival justifies this modality to be tested in a randomized fashion. We strongly encourage the transplant community to enroll patients in innovative trials utilizing FMT, as this may be a one of the safest strategies for both prevention and treatment of GVHD."

The overall eradication rate in the intention-to-treat analysis was 79.0% (3,689/4,669, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.8–80.2%), and that in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers (EMs), intermediate metabolizer (IMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) was 77.7% (1,137/1,464, 95% CI: 75.3–79.6%), 81.2% (1,498/1,844, 95% CI: 79.3–83.0%) and 86.8% (644/742, 95% CI: 83.9–88.9%), respectively. Meta-analysis showed that the relaTakashitive risk of failed eradication in CYP2C19 EMs compared with IMs and PMs was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.06–1.39, P = 0.006) and 1.57 (95% CI: 1.27–1.94, P < 0.001), respectively, in the fixed-effects model. The cure rate of omeprazole and lansoprazole-containing eradication regimens differed among CYP2C19 genotypes (P < 0.05), while that of rabeprazole and esomeprazole-containing regimens was similar. Conclusion: The cure rates of PPI-amoxicillin-clarithromycin H. pylori eradication regimen, especially those containing omeprazole and lansoprazole, differ among CYP2C19 genotypes. Therefore, selection of a second-generation PPI or tailored treatment may achieve higher eradication rates than first-generation PPI-amoxicillin-clarithromycin triple regimen."
"A planetary health model for reducing exposure to faecal contamination in urban informal settlements: Baseline findings from Makassar, Indonesia","French M.A., Fiona Barker S., Taruc R.R., Ansariadi A., Duffy G.A., Saifuddaolah M., Zulkifli Agussalim A., Awaluddin F., Zainal Z., Wardani J., Faber P.A., Fleming G., Ramsay E.E., Henry R., Lin A., O'Toole J., Openshaw J., Sweeney R., Sinharoy S.S., Kolotelo P., Jovanovic D., Schang C., Higginson E.E., Prescott M.F., Burge K., Davis B., Ramirez-Lovering D., Reidpath D., Greening C., Allotey P., Simpson J.A., Forbes A., Chown S.L., McCarthy D., Johnston D., Wong T., Brown R., Clasen T., Luby S., Leder K.","Environment International","10.1016/j.envint.2021.106679","155",NA,"2021","Background: The intense interactions between people, animals and environmental systems in urban informal settlements compromise human and environmental health. Inadequate water and sanitation services, compounded by exposure to flooding and climate change risks, expose inhabitants to environmental contamination causing poor health and wellbeing and degrading ecosystems. However, the exact nature and full scope of risks and exposure pathways between human health and the environment in informal settlements are uncertain. Existing models are limited to microbiological linkages related to faecal-oral exposures at the individual level, and do not account for a broader range of human-environmental variables and interactions that affect population health and wellbeing. Methods: We undertook a 12-month health and environmental assessment in 12 flood-prone informal settlements in Makassar, Indonesia. We obtained caregiver-reported health data, anthropometric measurements, stool and blood samples from children < 5 years, and health and wellbeing data for children 5–14 years and adult respondents. We collected environmental data including temperature, mosquito and rat species abundance, and water and sediment samples. Demographic, built environment and household asset data were also collected. We combined our data with existing literature to generate a novel planetary health model of health and environment in informal settlements. Results: Across the 12 settlements, 593 households and 2764 participants were enrolled. Two-thirds (64·1%) of all houses (26·3–82·7% per settlement) had formal land tenure documentation. Cough, fever and diarrhoea in the week prior to the survey were reported among an average of 34.3%, 26.9% and 9.7% of children aged < 5 years, respectively; although proportions varied over time, prevalence among these youngest children was consistently higher than among children 5–14 years or adult respondents. Among children < 5 years, 44·3% experienced stunting, 41·1% underweight, 12.4% wasting, and 26.5% were anaemic. There was self- or carer-reported poor mental health among 16.6% of children aged 5–14 years and 13.9% of adult respondents. Rates of potential risky exposures from swimming in waterways, eating uncooked produce, and eating soil or dirt were high, as were exposures to flooding and livestock. Just over one third of households (35.3%) had access to municipal water, and contamination of well water with E. coli and nitrogen species was common. Most (79·5%) houses had an in-house toilet, but no houses were connected to a piped sewer network or safe, properly constructed septic tank. Median monthly settlement outdoor temperatures ranged from 26·2 °C to 29.3 °C, and were on average, 1·1 °C warmer inside houses than outside. Mosquito density varied over time, with Culex quinquefasciatus accounting for 94·7% of species. Framed by a planetary health lens, our model includes four thematic domains: (1) the physical/built environment; (2) the ecological environment; (3) human health; and (4) socio-economic wellbeing, and is structured at individual, household, settlement, and city/beyond spatial scales. Conclusions: Our planetary health model includes key risk factors and faecal-oral exposure pathways but extends beyond conventional microbiological faecal-oral enteropathogen exposure pathways to comprehensively account for a wider range of variables affecting health in urban informal settlements. It includes broader ecological interconnections and planetary health-related variables at the household, settlement and city levels. It proposes a composite framework of markers to assess water and sanitation challenges and flood risks in urban informal settlements for optimal design and monitoring of interventions."

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in ulcerative colitis have established fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as an effective therapy. We have conducted a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of FMT in Crohn's disease. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed through to August 2020 (MEDLINE; Embase). Studies were included if they reported FMT administration in patients with Crohn's disease, and reported on clinical outcomes. Results: Fifteen studies published between 2014 and 2020, comprising 13 cohort studies and two RCTs, were included in the analysis. The majority of trials evaluated FMT for induction of remission, with follow-up duration varying from 4 to 52 weeks. One RCT in 21 patients, of single-dose FMT versus placebo, following steroid-induced remission, showed a higher rate of steroid-free clinical remission in the FMT group compared to the control group: 87.5% vs 44.4% at week 10 (P = 0.23). Another RCT, two-dose FMT in 31 patients, showed an overall clinical remission rate of 36% at week 8, however, with no difference in clinical or endoscopic endpoints between FMT administered by gastroscopy and colonoscopy. Considering all studies, the clinical response rates in early follow up were higher following multiple FMT than with single FMT. FMT dose did not appear to influence clinical outcomes, nor did whether FMT was fresh or frozen. FMT delivered via upper gastrointestinal route demonstrated higher early efficacy rates of 75 to 100% compared with lower delivery route rates of 30% to 58%, but on follow up beyond 8 weeks, this difference was not maintained. Whether pre-FMT antibiotic administration was beneficial was not able to be determined due to the limited number of patients receiving antibiotics and varying antibiotic regimens. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Preliminary studies suggest that FMT may be an effective therapy in Crohn's disease. However large controlled trials are needed. No serious safety concerns have been identified."
"Fecal microbial transplantation in critically ill patients—Structured review and perspectives","Cibulková I., Řehořová V., Hajer J., Duška F.","Biomolecules","10.3390/biom11101459","11","10","2021","The human gut microbiota consists of bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses. It is a dynamic ecosystem shaped by several factors that play an essential role in both healthy and diseased states of humans. A disturbance of the gut microbiota, also termed “dysbiosis,” is associated with increased host susceptibility to a range of diseases. Because of splanchnic ischemia, exposure to anti-biotics, and/or the underlying disease, critically ill patients loose 90% of the commensal organisms in their gut within hours after the insult. This is followed by a rapid overgrowth of potentially path-ogenic and pro-inflammatory bacteria that alter metabolic, immune, and even neurocognitive functions and that turn the gut into the driver of systemic inflammation and multiorgan failure. Indeed, restoring healthy microbiota by means of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in the critically ill is an attractive and plausible concept in intensive care. Nonetheless, available data from controlled studies are limited to probiotics and FMT for severe C.difficile infection or severe inflammatory bowel disease. Case series and observational trials have generated hypotheses that FMT might be feasible and safe in immunocompromised patients, refractory sepsis, or severe antibiotic-associated diarrhea in ICU. There is a burning need to test these hypotheses in randomized controlled trials powered for the determination of patient-centered outcomes."

Previous work has demonstrated the association between changes in the microbiome and metabolic risk factors. One related area of interest is the relationship between dysbiosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as the global prevalence of NAFLD, and its resultant complications, increases.Recent findingsIn this review, we summarize the hypothesized pathophysiology of dysbiosis-mediated progression of NAFLD, including promotion of an inflammatory intestinal environment, increased intestinal permeability, endogenous ethanol production, short-chain fatty acid production, secondary bile acid metabolism, and choline depletion. We also review potential therapeutic interventions of the microbiome to slow or prevent NAFLD progression, including antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplant, and farnesoid × receptor agonism.SummaryMuch of the evidence supporting dysbiosis-mediated NAFLD progression has been gathered in high-quality animal trials. There remains a need for additional observational and randomized controlled trials in humans to establish causality between the suspected factors and pathogenesis of NAFLD."

Lactulose and rifaximin are thought to alter gut flora thereby reducing ammonia production. Recent studies have investigated the benefit of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in preventing HE in patients with liver cirrhosis. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the benefit of FMT versus SOC in preventing HE and various outcomes in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. Methods: A literature search was performed using Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases from inception to June 2021. Studies included in our meta-analysis involved adult patients diagnosed with decompensated liver cirrhosis who received prophylactic FMT versus standard of care (SOC). Analysis was conducted using the Mantel-Haenszel model to assess the rate of HE, severe adverse events (SAE), death, variceal bleeding, and infection risk. The results were pooled together using Reviewer Manager 5.4 software, and heterogeneity was quantified using I2 statistics. Results: Five clinical trials involving 129 patients were included in the final analysis. All studies but one were randomized controlled trials. Our findings suggest that FMT provides a significant benefit in preventing HE in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis (OR 0.12, 95% CI [0.02, 0.58], P=0.009) compared to SOC. The rate of severe adverse events was significantly lower in the FMT group (OR 0.07, P<0.0001). The rates of death (OR 0.33, P=0.05), variceal bleeding (OR 0.51, P=0.30), and infection (OR 1.01, P=0.98) was similar between both groups. Only one study investigated the rate of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, as a result, analysis was not performed for this outcome. Conclusion: Prophylactic use of fecal microbiota transplantation demonstrated a significant benefit in preventing hepatic encephalopathy and serious adverse events in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis as compared to standard of care. There were no differences noted in terms of death rate, variceal bleeding, or the incidence of infection. The major limitation of this systematic review is the scarcity of studies about this topic and the small sample size of the analyzed studies.."

In patients with severe perianal disease, the creation of ostomy for fecal diversion (FD) may be necessary. Of those patients, a subgroup will end up with a permanent stoma. The rate of stoma reversal with subsequent intestinal continuity restoration varies in the literature and data in the post biologic era has been controversial. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a metaanalysis study of comparative studies comparing the use of anti tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents versus not and the rate of successful restoration of intestinal continuity and ostomy closure. Methods: A comprehensive search of Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus was conducted from each database's inception to January 16th, 2021. We included comparative studies of anti TNF agents versus nonbiologic therapies in Crohn's disease patients with fecal diversion and looked at the outcome of ostomy reversal and restoration of bowel continuity. Results: A total of seven studies assessed the use of anti TNF agents in post ostomy. Of this, data from five studies with a total of 348 patients were able to be extracted. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that the use of anti TNF agents post fecal diversion was not associated with a statistically significant risk of reducing the need for permanent ostomy (OR of 01.193; 95% CI: 0.618-2.303; I(2)= 22.7%). No publication bias was seen among the included studies as seen in the funnel plot. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis showed no difference in ostomy closure rate among patients with Crohn's disease with ostomy whether anti TNF therapy was used or not. However, our meta-analysis was limited by the small number of total patients included and the lack of randomized controlled trials."

However, the safety of MB is being questioned since serious adverse events (AEs) such as hemodynamic instability, hemolysis, and serotonin syndrome were reported. The aim of this study is a systematic analysis of the literature to obtain an evidence-based overview of AEs due to oral administration of MB and to determine its safety as a food dye during swallowing assessment. Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Two reviewers independently selected articles describing oral administration of MB as a main diagnostic/therapeutic intervention, dosage, and AEs. Expert opinions, conference papers, sample size < 10, and animal studies were excluded. Level of evidence of the included studies was determined. Results: A total of 2264 unduplicated articles were obtained. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria with 100% agreement between the two reviewers. Among these, twelve studies were randomized controlled trials. In a pooled population of 1902 patients receiving oral MB, three serious AEs were reported related to MB. Non-serious AEs showed a dose-related trend and were usually mild and self-limiting. A meta-analysis could not be performed as studies were methodologically too heterogeneous. Conclusion: Serious AEs due to oral administration of MB are rare (n = 3, 0.16%). MB-related non-serious AEs are mild, self-limiting, and show a dose-related trend. These findings indicate that it is safe to use small amounts of MB as a food dye during swallowing examinations."

However, in clinical practice, the data regarding how each etiology contributes to the diarrheal episodes are limited. We identify the causes and factors associated with post-feeding diarrhea. Methods: Using the data of patients enrolled in “Effect of Psyllium Fiber Supplementation on Diarrhea Incidence in Enteral Tube-Fed Patients: A Prospective, Randomized, and Controlled Trial”, the randomized controlled trial showed no difference in diarrheal incidences between fiber-added and fiber-free formulas. Hence, we analyzed the data of all enrolled patients. The causes of diarrhea were classified according to pre-specified definitions. The factors associated with diarrhea were analyzed using logistic regression. Results: Diarrhea was found in 37.3% (n = 31/83). The most common cause was medication associated (61.3%). CDAD and EN-associated diarrhea were found in only 9.7% and 6.5%, respectively. Patients with baseline albumin <3 g/dL and underlying cerebrovascular disease were more likely to develop diarrhea (adjusted odds ratio 5.70, 95% confidence interval 1.79–20.51, and adjusted odds ratio 10.83, 95% confidence interval 2.96–48.57, respectively). Compared with those without diarrhea, the length of hospital stay in CDAD patients was significantly longer (+23.1 days, P = 0.02), a trend of longer hospital stay in patients with diarrhea from other causes was observed (+3.2 days, P = 0.096). Conclusions: Our study found that the most common cause of post-feeding diarrhea is medication associated. Review and cessation of possible drugs should be undertaken before EN modification. CDAD accounts for <10% of diarrhea causes, but it impacts the clinical outcome and should be identified and treated properly."

Despite resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, at best, 3-year survival reaches 63.4%. Post-operative complications and poor performance mean that around 50% of the patients do not commence adjuvant chemotherapy, and a significant proportion do not complete the intended treatment course. These factors, along with the advantages of early treatment of micrometastatic disease, the ability to downstage tumors, and the increase in R0 resection rates, have increased interest in neo-adjuvant treatment strategies. Here we review biomarkers for early diagnosis of PDAC and patient selection for a neo-adjuvant approach. We also review the current evidence for different chemotherapy regimens in this setting, as well as the role of chemoradiotherapy and immunotherapy, and we discuss ongoing trials."

After birth, our intestine is colonized by microbes like Escherichia coli, Clostridium spp., Streptococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides spp., and Bifidobacterium spp. Our intestine is an extremely complex living system that participates in the protection of host through a strong defence against external aggregations. The microbial ecosystem of the intestine includes many native species of Bacteroides and Firmicutes that permanently colonize the gastrointestinal tract. The composition of flora changes over time depending upon diet and medical emergencies which leads to the diseased condition. Probiotics exert their mode of action by altering the local environment of the gut by competing with the pathogens, bacteriocins production, H2O2 production etc. Obesity is one of the major health problems and is considered as the most prevalent form of inappropriate nutrition. Probiotics like Lactobacillus Sp., Bifidobacterium Sp., Streptococcus Sp. are successfully used in the treatment of obesity proved in clinical trials. Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT), also known as a stool transplant, is the process of transplantation of Faecal bacteria from a healthy donor into a recipient's gut to restore normal flora in the recipient. The therapeutic principle on which FMT works is microbes and their functions and metabolites produced by them which are used to treat a variety of diseases. The present review focuses on the role of gastrointestinal microbiome, probiotic selection criteria, their applications and FMT to treat diseases."

Objectives: To review the literature about the impact of environmental interventions (non-related to sanitizers) in the clinical impact of MDROs. Methods: Studies were identified through electronic literature search of PubMed, CINAHL, and SCOPUS, by two independent authors. Any type of environmental interventions in surgical centers, ICUs and wards were evaluated. No restrictions regarding patients and microorganisms were applied. Bench studies, MDROs inocula on surfaces, studies based on sanitizers (disinfectants or detergents) or animal studies were excluded. Quality of randomized controlled trials and non-randomized ones were evaluated by the Cochrane Collaboration's tool, and Newcastle-Ottawa scale, respectively. Results: The search strategy identified 1173 studies. Of those, 20 studies were included in systematic review. Only 4 studies were randomized, and those, only 1 (a bundle-based intervention), assessed the impact on clinical outcomes. Bundle of interventions (including educational procedures) were the most frequently non-sanitiser method found (7 studies). Ultraviolet light (UV, 2 studies) and hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV, 4 studies) seemed to be promising methods to improve cleaning processes. Wipe-based methods were assessed in 2 prospective studies, and one of them highlights the potential of spread MDROs in case of not properly used. Other cleaning methods (for instance, testing more cloths, electrolysed water, extra cleaning etc.), were evaluated in 5 studies. Conclusion: UV, HPV, and bundle-based approaches seem to be potential complementary environmental interventions to sanitizers in hospitals. However, only few, low-quality interventional studies are available, most of them focused in microbiological, and not clinical outcomes. Future research in this area should focus in randomized clinical trials (including cluster) evaluating the potential intervention in clinically relevant outcomes."

We performed a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials to assess its efficacy and safety in patients with type 2 diabetes. Materials and methods: We searched Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and international clinical trial registries up to January 2021 for randomised controlled trials comparing sotagliflozin with placebo or active antidiabetic agents in adults with type 2 diabetes. Efficacy outcomes included change from baseline in HbA1c, body weight, and blood pressure. Safety outcomes included cardiovascular endpoints, serious adverse events, discontinuation due to any adverse event, hypoglycaemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, diarrhoea, volume depletion, and genital infections. We performed random effects meta-analyses and calculated mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes, alongside 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: We included 10 trials with 16231 patients. Mean trial duration was 50 weeks, while patient's mean age at baseline was 63.8 years, mean HbA1c was 8.2% and mean systolic blood pressure was 135.6 mmHg. Nine trials compared sotagliflozin with placebo, two with empagliflozin and one with glimepiride. Compared with placebo, sotagliflozin reduced HbA1c by 0.40 % (95% CI-0.54 to-0.26), body weight by 1.32 kg (95% CI-1.59 to-1.05), and systolic blood pressure by 2.44 mmHg (95% CI-2.81 to-2.07). No difference was evident versus active comparators. Compared with placebo, sotagliflozin reduced incidence of hospitalisation for heart failure (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.78) and myocardial infarction (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.98), and had a neutral effect on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and stroke. Treatment with sotagliflozin was safe regarding incidence of serious adverse events, severe hypoglycaemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis. However, it was associated with increased incidence of diarrhoea (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.71), volume depletion (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.50) and genital infections (OR 2.98, 95% CI 2.16 to 4.13). Conclusion: Sotagliflozin effectively and safely reduces HbA1c, body weight, systolic blood pressure, hospitalisation for heart failure, and myocardial infarction.

It is estimated that 2–3% of infants and young children have CMPA. The diet, gut microbiota, and their interactions are believed to be involved in the alterations of mucosal immune tolerance, which might lead to the development of CMPA and other food allergies. In this review, the potential molecular mechanisms of CMPA, including omics technologies used for analyzing microbiota, impacts of early microbial exposures on CMPA development, and microbiota–host interactions, are summarized. The probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and other modulation strategies for gut microbiota and the potential application of microbiota-based design of diets for the CMPA treatment are also discussed. This review not only summarizes the current studies about the interactions of CMPA with gut microbiota but also gives insights into the possible CMPA treatment strategies by modulating gut microbiota, which might help in improving the life quality of CMPA patients in the future."

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Data sources We performed a literature search of the electronic databases CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, MEDLINE (Ovid) and Web of Science from database inception to May 2021 as well as hand searching of trial registries and reference lists of related reviews. Study selection Two reviewers identified whether RCTs met the following inclusion criteria: adult population to whom antibiotics were administered; a probiotic intervention; a placebo, alternative dose, alternative probiotic strain or no treatment control; and incidence of AAD as the outcome. Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers independently collected data and assessed risk of bias using preconstructed data extraction forms. We used a random effects model for all analyses. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate species-specific and dose-specific response. Results Forty-two studies (11,305 participants) were included in this review. The pooled analysis suggests that co-administration of probiotics with antibiotics reduces the risk of AAD in adults by 37% (risk ratio (RR)=0.63 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.73), p<0.00001). The overall quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) criteria was found to be moderate. In subgroup analyses, high dose compared with low dose of the same probiotic demonstrated a positive protective effect (RR 0.54 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.76), p<0.01), and only certain species, mainly of the lactobacillus and bifidobacteria genera, were found to be effective. Studies with a low baseline AAD risk did not show any difference in risk but studies with moderate or high baseline AAD risk demonstrated a significant risk reduction. Conclusions Probiotics are effective for preventing AAD. Secondary analyses of higher dosages and certain species have shown increased effectiveness. Our results may not be applicable in clinical scenarios of lower baseline AAD risk."
"Effect of sanitation interventions on health outcomes: A systematic review of cluster-randomized controlled trials in rural communities of low-and middle-income countries","Kanda A., Ncube E.J., Voyi K.","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","10.3390/ijerph18168313","18","16","2021","A systematic review of published literature (2000–2019) evaluating the impact of sanitation interventions on the prevalence of disease, parasite infestation, and/or child growth using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was done according to the PRISMA checklist. Earlier reviews indicated mixed evidence citing relatively poor quality evidence from mixed designs. Public health policy and practice appear to rely on evidence from RCTs. Records were searched in six electronic databases. The methodological quality of RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane collaboration risk of bias tool. Fifteen records (2.0%) were included for review. Impact trials were done in rural communities of African and Asian countries. The significant effect of sanitation-focus interventions was found in one trial for the prevalence of childhood diarrhea (14.3%), three trials for parasite infestation (37.5%), and two trials (25.0%) for child growth. Results indicate mixed quality evidence from RCT designs. Evidence is limited and suggestive of the impact of sanitation on parasite infestation and child growth. Further rigorous sanitation intervention trials under varying settings are needed to show what really works and under what settings. Future work may explore sanitation behavior change strategies and latrine options to address the challenges of poor latrine use under high sanitation coverage."

Recent studies have demonstrated a relationship between gut bacteria and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Approximately 10%–20% of NAFLD patients develop nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and endotoxins produced by Gram-negative bacilli may be involved in NAFLD pathogenesis. NAFLD hyperendotoxicemia has intestinal and hepatic factors. The intestinal factors include impaired intestinal barrier function (leaky gut syndrome) and dysbiosis due to increased abundance of ethanol-producing bacteria, which can change endogenous alcohol concentrations. The hepatic factors include hyperleptinemia, which is associated with an excessive response to endotoxins, leading to intrahepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Clinically, the relationship between gut bacteria and NAFLD has been targeted in some randomized controlled trials of probiotics and other agents, but the results have been inconsistent. A recent randomized, placebo-controlled study explored the utility of lubiprostone, a treatment for constipation, in restoring intestinal barrier function and improving the outcomes of NAFLD patients, marking a new phase in the development of novel therapies targeting the intestinal barrier. This review summarizes recent data from studies in animal models and randomized clinical trials on the role of the gut–liver axis in NAFLD pathogenesis and progression."
"Pediatric digestive health and the gut microbiome: Existing therapies and a look to the future","Saul S., Fuessel J., Runde J.","Pediatric Annals","10.3928/19382359-20210720-01","50","8","2021","The human gut is host to trillions of microbes that from birth begin interacting with our immune system. Over time this relationship is thought to shape critical aspects of human function such as metabolism, brain development, immune response, and overall gut health. Recent advances in technology have allowed us to begin understanding this complex relationship and have demonstrated that microbes within the gut ecosystem can be influ-enced by a variety of factors including mode of delivery, diet, and medication exposure, all of which can impact host health in either positive or detrimental ways. Perturbations of gut homeostasis have been implicated in many forms of digestive disease such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, Helicobacter pylori infection, and even in cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. As such, researchers have sought methods to either restore gut homeostasis or prevent dysregulation of the gut community, also known as dysbiosis, through an emerging field known as microbial therapeutics. Examples of existing modalities are reviewed here such as prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbial trans-plantation, and dietary therapy. As these therapies become further substantiated through research and increasingly desired by patients and their families, there is a need for pro-viders caring for children to familiarize themselves with the existing data and indications for use. As we look to the future, machine-learning algorithms and more readily available next-generation sequencing of fecal samples may allow us to harness data from a per-son’s gut microbiota to predict response to a particular intervention and tailor therapeu-tic options with an aim toward precision medicine.

Objectives: We conducted an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews on the effectiveness and risks of interventions to treat overweight and obesity in children and adolescents. Methods: In June 2019, we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for eligible reviews. The primary outcomes were change in adiposity (body mass and body mass index [BMI] z-score) and adverse events. Two reviewers screened studies and one reviewer extracted and another verified data. Two reviewers assessed methodological quality and reached consensus. Data were synthesized narratively. Results: We included seven Cochrane reviews published between 2011 and 2017 containing evidence from 167 randomized controlled trials with 21,050 participants. Lifestyle and behavioural interventions more effectively reduced weight compared with no intervention, usual care, or another behavioural treatment (three reviews, low-to-moderate certainty). Parent-child lifestyle and behavioural interventions more effectively reduced BMI z-score compared with no intervention (one review, low certainty). Decision support tools for healthcare providers more effectively limited increases in BMI z-score compared with usual care (one review, moderate certainty). Pharmacologic treatments combined with behavioural modification more effectively reduced adiposity compared with placebo or usual care (one review, low certainty), but the risk of adverse events was greater than non-pharmacologic therapy. Surgical interventions (e.g., LAP-BAND) combined with behavioural modification more effectively reduced adiposity compared with behavioural modification alone (one review, low certainty). Those who underwent surgery reported a higher number of adverse events compared with those treated with lifestyle modification. Conclusions: There is low-certainty evidence that lifestyle and behavioural interventions, pharmacologic interventions, and surgical interventions are effective in weight management for children with overweight and obesity. Safety data remain lacking across all intervention modalities. Future research should focus on implementation strategies. Further, a focus on overall well-being may be more beneficial than weight management specifically."

"Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Assessment of the Clinical Efficacy of Bismuth Subsalicylate for Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diarrhea","Brum J.M., Gibb R.D., Ramsey D.L., Balan G., Yacyshyn B.R.","Digestive Diseases and Sciences","10.1007/s10620-020-06509-7","66","7","2021","Background: A large number of studies have evaluated the pharmacology, safety, and/or efficacy of bismuth subsalicylate for the relief of common gastrointestinal symptoms, diarrhea and vomiting due to acute gastroenteritis. In addition, short-term (48 h) medication with bismuth subsalicylate is known to be effective against infectious gastroenteritis such as travelers’ diarrhea. Aims: Previous studies have documented the bacteriostatic/bactericidal effects of bismuth subsalicylate against a variety of pathogenic gastrointestinal bacteria. However, meta-analyses of the clinical efficacy of bismuth subsalicylate for both prevention and treatment of travelers’ diarrhea have not yet been published. Methods: A total of 14 clinical studies (from 1970s to 2007) comprised the core data used in this assessment of efficacy of bismuth subsalicylate against infectious (including travelers’) diarrhea. These studies allowed for statistical meta-analyses regarding prevention (three travelers’ diarrhea studies) and treatment of infectious diarrhea (11 studies [five travelers’ diarrhea]). Results: The results show that subjects treated with bismuth subsalicylate for up to 21 days have 3.5 times greater odds of preventing travelers’ diarrhea compared with placebo (95% CI 2.1, 5.9; p < 0.001). In addition, subjects with infectious diarrhea treated with bismuth subsalicylate had 3.7 times greater odds of diarrhea relief (recorded on diaries as subjective symptomatic improvement) compared to those receiving placebo (95% CI 2.1, 6.3; p < 0.001). Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that bismuth subsalicylate can be beneficial for those at risk or affected by food and waterborne diarrheal disease such as traveler’s (infectious) diarrhea, and may decrease the risk of inappropriate antibiotic utilization."

The primary objective of this study was to characterize alterations in microRNAs (miRs) following FMT for rCDI. Methods: Sera from 2 prospective multicenter randomized controlled trials were analyzed for miRNA levels with the use of the Nanostring nCounter platform and quantitative reverse-transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, rCDI-FMT and toxin-treated animals and ex vivo human colonoids were used to compare intestinal tissue and circulating miRs. miR inflammatory gene targets in colonic epithelial and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were evaluated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and 3′UTR reporter assays. Colonic epithelial cells were used for mechanistic, cytoskeleton, cell growth, and apoptosis studies. Results: miRNA profiling revealed up-regulation of 64 circulating miRs 4 and 12 weeks after FMT compared with screening, of which the top 6 were validated in the discovery cohort by means of RT-qPCR. In a murine model of relapsing-CDI, RT-qPCR analyses of sera and cecal RNA extracts demonstrated suppression of these miRs, an effect reversed by FMT. In mouse colon and human colonoids, C difficile toxin B (TcdB) mediated the suppressive effects of CDI on miRs. CDI dysregulated DROSHA, an effect reversed by FMT. Correlation analyses, qPCR, and 3′UTR reporter assays revealed that miR-23a, miR-150, miR-26b, and miR-28 target directly the 3′UTRs of IL12B, IL18, FGF21, and TNFRSF9, respectively. miR-23a and miR-150 demonstrated cytoprotective effects against TcdB. Conclusions: These results provide novel and provocative evidence that modulation of the gut microbiome via FMT induces alterations in circulating and intestinal tissue miRs. These findings contribute to a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying FMT and identify new potential targets for therapeutic intervention in rCDI."

Participants 42 554 men and women, aged 50-74 years, participating in a randomised CRC screening trial. 36 059 participants underwent a sigmoidoscopy (and follow-up colonoscopy if positive sigmoidoscopy) and 6495 underwent a colonoscopy after a positive faecal immunochemical test (FIT). Primary and secondary outcome measures Proportion of asymptomatic participants diagnosed with CRC or advanced adenomas. Prevalence of bowel symptoms (rectal bleeding, change in bowel habits, diarrhoea, constipation, bloating, alternating bowel habits, general symptoms, other bowel symptoms) recorded by the endoscopist and their association with CRC and advanced adenomas. Results Among sigmoidoscopy participants, 7336 (20.3%) reported at least one symptom. 120 (60%) out of 200 individuals with screen-detected CRC and 1301 (76.5%) out of 1700 with advanced adenoma were asymptomatic. Rectal bleeding was associated with detection of CRC and advanced adenoma (OR 4.3, 95% CI 3.1 to 6.1 and 1.8, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.1, respectively), while change in bowel habits only with CRC detection (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.4 to 6.1). Among the FIT positives, 2173 (33.5%) reported at least one symptom. Out of 299 individuals with screen-detected CRC and 1639 with advanced adenoma, 167 (55.9%) and 1 175 (71.7%) were asymptomatic, respectively. Detection of CRC was associated with rectal bleeding (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.3), change in bowel habits (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4 to 3.5) and abdominal pain (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.7). Conclusions Some bowel symptoms increased the likelihood of being diagnosed with CRC or advanced adenoma. However, the majority of individuals with these findings were asymptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals should be encouraged to participate in CRC screening. Trial registration number Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01538550."
"Cilostazol for intermittent claudication","Brown T., Forster R.B., Cleanthis M., Mikhailidis D.P., Stansby G., Stewart M.","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","10.1002/14651858.CD003748.pub5","2021","6","2021","Background: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects between 4% and 12% of people aged 55 to 70 years, and 20% of people over 70 years. A common complaint is intermittent claudication (exercise-induced lower limb pain relieved by rest). These patients have a three- to six-fold increase in cardiovascular mortality. Cilostazol is a drug licensed for the use of improving claudication distance and, if shown to reduce cardiovascular risk, could offer additional clinical benefits. This is an update of the review first published in 2007. Objectives: To determine the effect of cilostazol on initial and absolute claudication distances, mortality and vascular events in patients with stable intermittent claudication. Search methods: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and AMED databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registries, on 9 November 2020. Selection criteria: We considered double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of cilostazol versus placebo, or versus other drugs used to improve claudication distance in patients with stable intermittent claudication. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trials for selection and independently extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. For dichotomous outcomes, we used odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and for continuous outcomes we used mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs. We pooled data using a fixed-effect model, or a random-effects model when heterogeneity was identified. Primary outcomes were initial claudication distance (ICD) and quality of life (QoL). Secondary outcomes were absolute claudication distance (ACD), revascularisation, amputation, adverse events and cardiovascular events. Main results: We included 16 double-blind, RCTs (3972 participants) comparing cilostazol with placebo, of which five studies also compared cilostazol with pentoxifylline. Treatment duration ranged from six to 26 weeks. All participants had intermittent claudication secondary to PAD. Cilostazol dose ranged from 100 mg to 300 mg; pentoxifylline dose ranged from 800 mg to 1200 mg. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded by one level for all studies because publication bias was strongly suspected. Other reasons for downgrading were imprecision, inconsistency and selective reporting. Cilostazol versus placebo. Participants taking cilostazol had a higher ICD compared with those taking placebo (MD 26.49 metres; 95% CI 18.93 to 34.05; 1722 participants; six studies; low-certainty evidence). We reported QoL measures descriptively due to insufficient statistical detail within the studies to combine the results; there was a possible indication in improvement of QoL in the cilostazol treatment groups (low-certainty evidence). Participants taking cilostazol had a higher ACD compared with those taking placebo (39.57 metres; 95% CI 21.80 to 57.33; 2360 participants; eight studies; very-low certainty evidence). The most commonly reported adverse events were headache, diarrhoea, abnormal stools, dizziness, pain and palpitations. Participants taking cilostazol had an increased odds of experiencing headache compared to participants taking placebo (OR 2.83; 95% CI 2.26 to 3.55; 2584 participants; eight studies; moderate-certainty evidence).Very few studies reported on other outcomes so conclusions on revascularisation, amputation, or cardiovascular events could not be made. Cilostazol versus pentoxifylline. There was no difference detected between cilostazol and pentoxifylline for improving walking distance, both in terms of ICD (MD 20.0 metres, 95% CI -2.57 to 42.57; 417 participants; one study; low-certainty evidence); and ACD (MD 13.4 metres, 95% CI -43.50 to 70.36; 866 participants; two studies; very low-certainty evidence). One study reported on QoL; the study authors reported no difference in QoL between the treatment groups (very low-certainty evidence). No study reported on revascularisation, amputation or cardiovascular events. Cilostazol participants had an increased odds of experiencing headache compared with participants taking pentoxifylline at 24 weeks (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.17; 982 participants; two studies; low-certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: Cilostazol has been shown to improve walking distance in people with intermittent claudication. However, participants taking cilostazol had higher odds of experiencing headache. There is insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of cilostazol for serious events such as amputation, revascularisation, and cardiovascular events. Despite the importance of QoL to patients, meta-analysis could not be undertaken because of differences in measures used and reporting. Very limited data indicated no difference between cilostazol and pentoxifylline for improving walking distance and data were too limited for any conclusions on other outcomes."

The effective remedy is still unknown, and a new therapeutic approach is highly desirable. The review elaborates the influence of probiotic bacteria on respiratory allergy prevention and treatment with particular emphasis on the impact of the current methods of their administration – oral and intranasal. The background of the respiratory allergy is complex thus, we focused on the usefulness of probiotics in the alleviation of different allergy factors, in particular involved in pathomechanism, local hypersensitive evidence and the importance of epithelial barrier. In this review, we have shown that (1) probiotic strains may vary in modulatory potential in respiratory allergy, (2) probiotic bacteria are beneficial in oral and intranasal administration, (3) recombinant probiotic bacteria can modulate the course of respiratory allergy."

Hence, this review was undertaken to analyse the available evidence on bioaerosols in OSPs, and their significance in COVID-19 transmission. Methods: A systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv and Lancet preprint databases for studies on bioaerosols in OSPs. Random-effects metanalysis was conducted to determine pooled estimates of key bioaerosol characteristics. Risk of bias was assessed by the RoB-SPEO tool; overall strength of evidence was assessed by the GRADE approach. Results: 17 studies were included in the systematic review, and 6 in different sets of meta-analyses. The pooled estimate of particle density was 390.74 μg/m(3), Total Particle Count, 6.08 × 10(6)/m(3), and Microbial Air Contamination, 8.08 CFU/m(3). Small sized particles (</ = 0.5 μm) were found to be 37 and 1604 times more frequent in the aerosol cloud in comparison to medium and large sized particles respectively. 4 studies reported that haemoglobin could be detected in aerosols, and one study showed that HIV could be transmitted by blood aerosolized by electric saw and burr. The risk of bias for all studies in the review was determined to be high, and the quality of evidence, low. Conclusion: Whereas there is evidence to suggest that OSPs generate large amounts of bioaerosols, their potential to transmit infectious diseases like COVID-19 is questionable. High-quality research, as well as consensus minimum reporting guidelines for bioaerosol research in OSPs is the need of the hour."

Data Sources: MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant studies published from January 1, 2015, to December 4, 2019; surveillance through March 26, 2021. Study Selection: English-language studies conducted in asymptomatic populations at general risk of CRC. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers independently appraised the articles and extracted relevant study data from fair- or good-quality studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. Main Outcomes and Measures: Colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, test accuracy in detecting cancers or adenomas, and serious adverse events. Results: The review included 33 studies (n = 10776276) on the effectiveness of screening, 59 (n = 3491045) on the test performance of screening tests, and 131 (n = 26987366) on the harms of screening. In randomized clinical trials (4 trials, n = 458002), intention to screen with 1- or 2-time flexible sigmoidoscopy vs no screening was associated with a decrease in CRC-specific mortality (incidence rate ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.68-0.80]). Annual or biennial guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) vs no screening (5 trials, n = 419966) was associated with a reduction of CRC-specific mortality after 2 to 9 rounds of screening (relative risk at 19.5 years, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.84-0.98]; relative risk at 30 years, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.65-0.93]). In observational studies, receipt of screening colonoscopy (2 studies, n = 436927) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) (1 study, n = 5.4 million) vs no screening was associated with lower risk of CRC incidence or mortality. Nine studies (n = 6497) evaluated the test accuracy of screening computed tomography (CT) colonography, 4 of which also reported the test accuracy of colonoscopy; pooled sensitivity to detect adenomas 6 mm or larger was similar between CT colonography with bowel prep (0.86) and colonoscopy (0.89). In pooled values, commonly evaluated FITs (14 studies, n = 45403) (sensitivity, 0.74; specificity, 0.94) and stool DNA with FIT (4 studies, n = 12424) (sensitivity, 0.93; specificity, 0.85) performed better than high-sensitivity gFOBT (2 studies, n = 3503) (sensitivity, 0.50-0.75; specificity, 0.96-0.98) to detect cancers. Serious harms of screening colonoscopy included perforations (3.1/10000 procedures) and major bleeding (14.6/10000 procedures). CT colonography may have harms resulting from low-dose ionizing radiation. It is unclear if detection of extracolonic findings on CT colonography is a net benefit or harm. Conclusions and Relevance: There are several options to screen for colorectal cancer, each with a different level of evidence demonstrating its ability to reduce cancer mortality, its ability to detect cancer or precursor lesions, and its risk of harms."
"The effect of perioperative administration of probiotics on colorectal cancer surgery outcomes","Pitsillides L., Pellino G., Tekkis P., Kontovounisios C.","Nutrients","10.3390/nu13051451","13","5","2021","1 Abstract: The perioperative care of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients includes antibiotics. Although antibiotics do provide a certain protection against infections, they do not eliminate them completely, and they do carry risks of microbial resistance and disruption of the microbiome. Probiotics can maintain the microbiome’s balance postoperatively by maintaining intestinal mucosal integrity and reducing bacterial translocation (BT). This review aims to assess the role of probiotics in the perioperative management of CRC patients. The outcomes were categorised into: postoperative infectious and non-infectious complications, BT rate analysis, and intestinal permeability assessment. Fifteen randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. There was a trend towards lower rates of postoperative infectious and non-infectious complications with probiotics versus placebo. Probiotics reduced BT, maintained intestinal mucosal permeability, and provided a better balance of beneficial to pathogenic microorganisms. Heterogeneity among RCTs was high. Factors that influence the effect of probiotics include the species used, using a combination vs. single species, the duration of administration, and the location of the bowel resection. Although this review provided evidence for how probiotics possibly operate and reported notable evidence that probiotics can lower rates of infections, heterogeneity was observed. In order to corroborate the findings, future RCTs should keep the aforementioned factors constant."

The infection is most likely secondary to the autograft becoming contaminated during harvest and preparation, introducing bacteria into the joint on insertion. Presoaking ACL grafts in 5 mg/mL vancomycin is a novel method developed to eradicate this bacterial contamination and is supported by compelling Level III evidence from multiple observational trials showing a dramatic reduction in infection rates without any evidence of increased graft failure. As such, it is time for this technique to become a universal recommendation? That said, as observational studies using a historical cohort as a comparator are at risk of various biases, Level I evidence is ultimately required for infection prophylaxis methods to be recognized as a universal recommendation in infection control guidelines. Consequently, future research endeavors on the “vancomycin wrap” should focus on randomized controlled trials, possibly nested within ACL registries."

Aim: Microscopic colitis (MC) presents with chronic watery diarrhea, abdominalpain, cramping, bloating, nocturnal defecation, and occasional weight loss. The diagnosisis based on colonic tissue biopsy to reveal specific histological features. Several drugs,including mesalamine, budesonide, and other immunomodulators, are used for treating thedisease process. In this meta-analysis, we compared treatment efficacy and adverse events(AEs) of budesonide and mesalamine therapy in MC. Methods: We searched the CochraneLibrary, Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed, comparing mesalamine or budesonide witha control group in the treatment of MC. Outcomes included clinical remission (three orfewer stools/day), stool characteristics (daily stool weight, daily stool frequency, daily stoolconsistency), and the number of patients with clinical response (<50% in the disease activity).Safety endpoints included: any AE-related discontinuation, including abdominal discomfort,constipation, flatulence, nausea, dizziness, headache, bronchitis, nasopharyngitis, and depression.The meta-analysis was conducted using the generic inverse variance method andperformed a subgroup analysis based on the intervention. Results:Our literature search retrieved 19 randomized clinical trials with a total of 821 patients.We report that after eight weeks of follow-up, budesonide showed significantly higher clinicalremission rates RR=2.29 [2.14, 2.45], than mesalamine RR= 1.7 [1.41, 2.05], p=0.003. Aftereight weeks, no difference in stool weight was seen in the budesonide group (MD=-351.62[-534.25, -168.99]) compared to mesalamine (MD=-104.3 [-372.34, 163.74]), p=0.14.However, the daily stool frequency was significantly less in the budesonide group thanmesalamine (p<0.001). Also, significantly lower endpoint AEs were reported with budesonideas compared to mesalamine (p=0.002). Conclusion: Treatment with budesonide was foundto be superior to mesalamine in microscopic colitis patients in terms of clinical remissionrate (stool frequency), especially after eight weeks of follow up. Budesonide also showed asignificantly fewer AEs. There is a need for randomized, double-blinded clinical trials toprovide direct evidence for our results.

"Effect of electroacupuncture on chemotherapy-induced diarrhea: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Wang Y., Zhou M., Shen J., Wang D., Xu N., Song Y., Sun M., Chen L., Pei L., Sun J.","Translational Cancer Research","10.21037/tcr-20-3400","10","5","2021","Background: Chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (CID) is one of the side effects of chemotherapy. Diarrhea not only affects the overall treatment effectiveness but also reduces patients' quality of life. Severe diarrhea can lead to electrolyte imbalance and even be life-threatening. Although acupuncture has been widely used in clinical practice and its effectiveness for managing functional diarrhea has been recognized, there is no sound evidence of its efficacy in managing CID. Therefore, the aim of the proposed randomized controlled trial is to examine the effectiveness and potential risks of using acupuncture for the management of CID and to describe its protocol herein. Methods: This trial will be conducted in a double-blinded manner and comprise two arms that will be investigated across multiple centers in parallel. The study cohort will comprise 168 outpatients who have CID from six Chinese hospitals. The patients will be randomly and equally divided between an intervention group (electroacupuncture) and a control group (micro-electroacupuncture). In the former, acupuncture will be performed with the conventional method to induce the de qi sensation, and in the latter group, acupuncture will be performed with a sham procedure that does not involve the insertion of needles. The acupoints ST25, SP14, SP6, and ST37 will be applied in the two methods. These procedures will be performed three times a week for four consecutive weeks. The number of days on which CID occurred, the incidence of CID, and fecal characteristics are considered as the primary outcomes, and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy for Patients with Diarrhea subscale score and the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment are considered as secondary outcomes. The patients will be closely observed for complications and fluctuations in vital signs. Discussion: If the findings from the trial demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of using acupuncture to treat CID, they could serve as evidence for the clinical application of acupuncture as a complementary treatment for cancer patients during chemotherapy."

Termed the brain-gut axis, this bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and enteric nervous system relies on immune, endocrine, neural, and metabolic pathways. There is increasing evidence that the gut microbiome is a key part of this system, and dysregulation of the brain-gut-microbiome axis (BGMA) has been implicated in disorders of brain-gut interaction, including irritable bowel syndrome, and in neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorder. Further, alterations in the gut microbiome have been implicated in the pathogenesis of organic gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. The BGMA is an attractive therapeutic target, as using prebiotics, probiotics, or postbiotics to modify the gut microbiome or mimic gut microbial signals could provide novel treatment options to address these debilitating diseases. However, despite significant advancements in our understanding of the BGMA, clinical data is lacking. In this article, we will review current understanding of the comorbidity of gastrointestinal diseases and psychological disorders. We will also review the current evidence supporting the key role of the BGMA in this pathology. Finally, we will discuss the clinical implications of the BGMA in the evaluation and management of psychological and gastrointestinal disorders."
"Distribution and drug resistance of pathogens in burn patients in China from 2006 to 2019","Chen H., Yang L., Cheng L., Hu X.-H., Shen Y.-M.","World Journal of Clinical Cases","10.12998/wjcc.v9.i10.2228","9","10","2021","BACKGROUND In this study, recent trends in the distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients treated at a burn ward between 2006 and 2019 were investigated. AIM To develop more effective clinical strategies and techniques for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections in burn patients. METHODS Clinical samples with positive bacteria were collected from patients at the burn ward in Beijing Jishuitan Hospital in China between January 2006 and December 2019. The samples were retrospectively analyzed, the distribution of pathogenic bacteria was determined, and the trends and changes in bacterial drug resistance during different period were assessed. Drug resistance in several main pathogenic bacteria from 2006 to 2011 and from 2012 to 2019 was comparatively summarized and analyzed. RESULTS Samples from 17119 patients were collected and analyzed from 2006 to 2019. Surprisingly, a total of 7960 strains of different pathogenic bacteria were isolated at this hospital. Among these bacteria, 87.98% (7003/7960) of the strains were isolated from burn wounds, and only 1.34% (107/7960) were isolated from the blood of patients. In addition, 49.70% (3956/7960) were identified as Gram-positive bacteria, 48.13% (3831/7960) were Gram-negative bacteria, and the remaining 2.17% (173/7960) were classified as fungi or other pathogens. Importantly, Staphylococcus aureus (21.68%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.23%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (9.61%) were the top three pathogens most frequently isolated from patients. CONCLUSION In patients treated at the burn ward in this hospital from 2006 to 2019, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the predominant clinical pathogens responsible for bacterial infections. The circumstantial detection and detailed monitoring of the intensity and growth of different pathogenic bacteria in clinical patients as well as tests of drug sensitivity during burn recovery are particularly important to provide guidelines for the application of antibiotics and other related drugs. Careful collection and correct, standard culture of bacterial specimens are also crucial to improve the efficiency of bacterial infection detection. Effective monitoring and timely clinical treatment in patients may help reduce the possibility and rate of infection as well as alleviate the effects of drug resistance among patients in burn centers."
"Role of d-mannose in the prevention of recurrent uncomplicated cystitis: State of the art and future perspectives","De Nunzio C., Bartoletti R., Tubaro A., Simonato A., Ficarra V.","Antibiotics","10.3390/antibiotics10040373","10","4","2021","Background: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are highly frequent in women, with a significant impact on healthcare resources. Although antibiotics still represent the standard treatment to manage recurrent UTI (rUTI), D-mannose, an inert monosaccharide that is metabolized and excreted in urine and acts by inhibiting bacterial adhesion to the urothelium, represents a promising nonantibiotic prevention strategy. The aim of this narrative review is to critically analyze clinical studies reporting data concerning the efficacy and safety of D-mannose in the management of rUTIs. Methods: A nonsystematic literature search, using the Pubmed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Central Database of Systematic Reviews databases, was performed for relevant articles published between January 2010 and January 2021. The following Medical Subjects Heading were used: “female/woman”, “urinary tract infection”, and “D-mannose”. Only clinical studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses reporting efficacy or safety data on D-mannose versus placebo or other competitors were selected for the present review. Evidence was limited to human data. The selected studies were organized in two categories according to the presence or not of a competitor to D-mannose. Results: After exclusion of non-pertinent studies/articles, 13 studies were analyzed. In detail, six were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one a randomized cross-over trial, five prospective cohort studies, and one a retrospective analysis. Seven studies compared D-mannose to placebo or others drugs/dietary supplements. Six studies evaluated the efficacy of D-mannose comparing follow-up data with the baseline. D-mannose is well tolerated, with few reported adverse events (diarrhea was reported in about 8% of patients receiving 2 g of D-mannose for at least 6 months). Most of the studies also showed D-mannose can play a role in the prevention or rUTI or urodynamics-associated UTI and can overlap antibiotic treatments in some cases. The possibility to combine D-mannose with polyphenols or Lactobacillus seems another important option for UTI prophylaxis. However, the quality of the collected studies was very low, generating, consequently, a weak grade of recommendations as suggested by international guidelines. Data on D-mannose dose, frequency, and duration of treatment are still lacking. Conclusion: Dmannose alone or in combination with several dietary supplements or Lactobacillus has a potential role in the non antimicrobial prophylaxis or recurrent UTI in women. Despite its frequent prescription in real-life practice, we believe that further well-designed studies are urgently needed to definitively support the role of D-mannose in the management of recurrent UTIs in women."

We review basic pharmacological and clinical researches of HET and discuss the effects of HET against the pandemic COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed pharmacological studies from 1996 to 30 April 2020 that used experimental animals orally treated with HET and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 2000 to 30 April 2020. Results: Altogether, 64 pharmacological studies reported immuno-stimulatory effects against infection and cancer, immuno-modulative effects against allergy and some inflammatory diseases, and ameliorating effects against exhaustion and frailty. Nine RCTs showed improvement of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex disease on chest X-ray; improved systemic inflammation, nutrition, and quality of life of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a decrease in the number getting common cold and exacerbations; reduction of soluble interleukin-2 receptor and the serum cortisol concentration of postoperative patients; a reduction of the incidence of inflammatory complications and C-reactive protein elevation after cerebrovascular disease; a reduction of the volume of steroid and tacrolimus during the treatment of atopic dermatitis; a healing effect for intractable chronic wounds; improvement of the physical status of elderly weak patients; and improvement of the fatigue level of cancer patients. Conclusion: CODIV-19 is characterized by high risk for the aged and people with other disease complications, cytokine hyperactivity in the severe stage, and sequelae in the recovery stage. Considering the immune-stimulative/modulative effects of HET on inflammatory conditions and against exhaustion and frailty, it may be useful for prevention, treatment, and recovery from COVID-19."

It has a long half-life and activity against liver-stage malaria parasites, so may be useful for chemoprophylaxis. Antimalarial agents are drugs used for the treatment or prophylaxis of malaria. Malaria is caused by four species of Plasmodium, such as Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax. Arakoda contains tafenoquine succinate, an antimalarial agent for oral administration. The molecular formula of tafenoquine succinate is C(24)H(28)F(3)N(3)O(3)∙C(4)H(6)O(4) and its molecular weight is 581.6 as the succinate salt. It is given in prophylaxis of malaria patient aged 18 years older. Tafenoquine is active against pre-erythrocytic (liver) and erythrocytic (asexual) forms as well as gametocytes of Plasmodium species. G6PD test is performed before giving the drug. Analytical studies were on NMR, IR, MS, HPLC, Flourimetry analysis. In vitro studies have shown that tafenoquine presents an average 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.436mcg against blood stages of seven strains of P. falciparum. The long‐ acting 8‐ aminoquinoline tafenoquine (TQ) co-administered with chloroquine (CQ) may radically cure Plasmodium vivax malaria. Coadministration therapy was evaluated for a pharmacokinetic interaction and for pharmacodynamic, safety and tolerability characteristics. Volume of distribution. The activation of tafenoquine needs the activity of CYP 2D6 liver microsomal enzyme. Routes of elimination are through feces."
"Antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in liver cirrhosis: Systematic review","Pimentel R.A.G.R., Gregório C., Figueiredo P.","Acta Gastro-Enterologica Belgica","10.51821/84.2.333","84","2","2021","Background and aim: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a potentially life-threatening infection in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites. Its prevention is vital to improve prognosis of cirrhotic patients. The main objective of this systematic review was to evaluate what is the most efficacious and safest antibiotic prophylactic strategy. Methods: Studies were located by searching PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library until February 2019. Randomized controlled trials evaluating primary or secondary spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with ascites were included. The selection of studies was performed in two stages: screening of titles and abstracts, and assessment of the full papers identified as relevant, considering the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted in a standardized way and synthesized qualitatively. Results: Fourteen studies were included. This systematic review demonstrated that daily norfloxacin is effective as a prophylactic antibiotic for the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis. Once weekly ciprofloxacin was not inferior to once daily norfloxacin, with good tolerance and no induced resistance. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and norfloxacin have similar efficacy for primary and secondary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, however, trimethoprim-sulfa-methoxazole was associated with an increased risk of developing an adverse event. Rifaximin was more effective than norfloxacin in the secondary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, with a significant decrease in adverse events and mortality rate. Conclusions: Continuous long-term selective intestinal decontamination with norfloxacin is the most widely used prophylactic strategy in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, yet other equally effective and safe options are available."
"Growth Delay in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Significance, Causes, and Management","Wong K., Isaac D.M., Wine E.","Digestive Diseases and Sciences","10.1007/s10620-020-06759-5","66","4","2021","Growth delay with height and weight impairment is a common feature of pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases (PIBD). Up to 2/3 of Crohn Disease patients have impaired weight at diagnosis, and up to 1/3 have impaired height. Ulcerative colitis usually manifests earlier with less impaired growth, though patients can be affected. Ultimately, growth delay, if not corrected, can reduce final adult height. Weight loss, reduced bone mass, and pubertal delay are also concerns associated with growth delay in newly diagnosed PIBD patients. The mechanisms for growth delay in IBD are multifactorial and include reduced nutrient intake, poor absorption, increased fecal losses, as well as direct effects from inflammation and treatment modalities. Management of growth delay requires optimal disease control. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN), biologic therapy, and corticosteroids are the primary induction strategies used in PIBD, and both EEN and biologics positively impact growth and bone development. Beyond adequate disease control, growth delay and pubertal delay require a multidisciplinary approach, dependent on diligent monitoring and identification, nutritional rehabilitation, and involvement of endocrinology and psychiatry services as needed. Pitfalls that clinicians may encounter when managing growth delay include refeeding syndrome, obesity (even in the setting of malnutrition), and restrictive diets. Although treatment of PIBD has improved substantially in the last several decades with the era of biologic therapies and EEN, there is still much to be learned about growth delay in PIBD in order to improve outcomes."
"The role of diet in the pathophysiology and management of irritable bowel syndrome","El-Salhy M., Patcharatrakul T., Gonlachanvit S.","Indian Journal of Gastroenterology","10.1007/s12664-020-01144-6","40","2","2021","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder that reportedly affects 5% to 20% of the world population. The etiology of IBS is not completely understood, but diet appears to play an important role in its pathophysiology. Asian diets differ considerably from those in Western countries, which might explain differences in the prevalence, sex, and clinical presentation seen between patients with IBS in Asian and Western countries. Dietary regimes such as a low-fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet and the modified National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) diet improve both symptoms and the quality of life in a considerable proportion of IBS patients. It has been speculated that diet is a prebiotic for the intestinal microbiota and favors the growth of certain bacteria. These bacteria ferment the dietary components, and the products of fermentation act upon intestinal stem cells to influence their differentiation into enteroendocrine cells. The resulting low density of enteroendocrine cells accompanied by low levels of certain hormones gives rise to intestinal dysmotility, visceral hypersensitivity, and abnormal secretion. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that changing to a low-FODMAP diet restores the density of GI cells to the levels in healthy subjects. These changes in gut endocrine cells caused by low-FODMAP diet are also accompanied by improvements in symptoms and the quality of life."

The neuropathological inclusions are tau proteins, TAR DNA binding protein 43 kDa-TDP-43, or fused in sarcoma-ubiquitinated inclusions. Genetically, several autosomal mutations account for the heritability of the disorder. Phenotypically, frontotemporal dementia can present with a behavioral variant or a language variant called primary progressive aphasia. To date, there are no approved symptomatic or disease-modifying treatments for frontotemporal dementia. Currently used therapies are supported by low-level of evidence (mostly uncontrolled) studies. The off-label use of drugs is also limited by their side-effect profile including an increased risk of confusion, parkinsonian symptoms, and risk of mortality. Emerging disease-modifying treatments currently target the progranulin and the expansion on chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 genes as well as tau deposits. Advancing our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and improving the design of future clinical trials are much needed to optimize the chances to obtain positive outcomes."

Recent trials suggest the possible use of prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics can helpovercome gastrointestinal and dermatological symptomsthrough increasing the proportion of faecal bacteria (1)Aim: This review aims to determine the effectiveness ofprebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics when added to formulain alleviating allergy symptoms and increasing faecal bacteria in CMPA among infants and children up to the age of 3.Methods: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, CINAHLand Cochrane Library was conducted using a search strategyinvolving subject heading, keywords and Boolean operators(AND/OR) between January 1999 to November 2019. Aninvestigator, who was not blinded, assessed the eligibility ofthe studies against an inclusion and exclusion criteria, established a priori which included any strain or dose of synbiotic,prebiotic or probiotic taken in any form alongside formulawithin infants and children. The same investigator extractedthe data from a modified extraction form. The Cochranerisk of bias tool and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist was conducted to assess quality and level of confidence of each review. Ethical approval was approved byCoventry University Ethics Committee.Result: From 94 screened titles, eight randomised controltrials involving 623 patients with CMPA met eligibility criteria with a mean age between 2.2 months and 9.5 months.Therefore, the studies did not focus on effects in children.The duration of the intervention ranged from 4 to 26 weeksand no studies reported prebiotics as their sole intervention. Five studies added the intervention to formula eitherto amino acid, casein or whey-based formula. However, theother three studies used liquid drops, a capsule or a freezedried powder to be added to formula. All trials used a control group with the same standard formula alone or witheither a placebo capsule, drops or powder. The primary interest, relief of symptoms, was measured using eczema assessment or through assessor or parent-reported outcomes.These pooled results showed mixed evidence around reliefof diarrhoea in both probiotics and synbiotics but showedno significant improvement in respiratory, dermatologicaland other symptoms reported. For the secondary outcomeof interest, results from five studies showed benefit of probiotics and synbiotics in increasing faecal bifidobacteriaand E. rectale/C. coccoides (ER/CC) strains which is ofimportance as low levels of bifidobacteria colonisation inparticular has been linked to allergy development (2) andlinks between microbiota have found in development ofasthma, inflammatory bowel disease and metabolic disorders (3)Discussion: Five of the eight studies raised concerns overthe risk of bias which limits the validity of these results.Furthermore, one study was stopped early due to adverseevents, there is more likely to show extreme intervention effects. Also, there were differences in the type of interventionutilised (different strains or forms such as liquids and powders) and a difference in symptom which lead to difficultymaking comparisons.Conclusions: Overall, there is low certainty that the use ofprobiotics and synbiotics, when added to formula, can improve symptom relief and increase faecal bacteria in infantswith CMPA due to low sample size and mixed bias from thestudies included. No papers focused on prebiotics so there isno certainty of the effects on alleviating symptoms or changing faecal bacteria."

However, during the last 10 years, increasing evidence has revealed its biological functions under pathological conditions. More specifically, H(2) has protective effects against a variety of diseases, particularly nervous system disorders, which include ischemia/reperfusion injury, traumatic injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, neuropathic pain, neurodegenerative diseases, cognitive dysfunction induced by surgery and anesthesia, anxiety, and depression. In addition, H(2) plays protective roles mainly through anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, the regulation of autophagy, and preservation of mitochondrial function and the blood-brain barrier. Further, H(2) is easy to use and has neuroprotective effects with no major side-effects, indicating that H(2) administration is a potential therapeutic strategy in clinical settings. Here we summarize the H(2) donors and their pharmacokinetics. Meanwhile, we review the effectiveness and safety of H(2) in the treatment of various nervous system diseases based on preclinical and clinical studies, leading to the conclusion that H(2) can be a simple and effective clinical therapy for CNS diseases such as ischemia-reperfusion brain injury, Parkinson’s disease, and diseases characterized by cognitive dysfunction.

In this network meta-analysis, we aimed to compare all available therapies against multiple recurrent CDI (mrCDI) and rank them by efficacy. Methods: After a systematic search, randomized controlled trials (RCT) with any interventions against mrCDI were included. Data were extracted to the study database using Excel. Risk of bias assessment was performed with the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. The primary outcome was the clinical cure of CDI and the secondary outcome was the recurrence of CDI. A Bayesian method was performed to investigate the efficacy rank order of therapies. We registered our protocol with the Prospero Center for Reviews and Dissemination (registration no. CRD42020160365). Results: Six RCTs with seven interventions were included in the quantitative synthesis. According to the surface under the cumulative ranking curve values, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) after a short course of vancomycin therapy (83%) shows the highest efficacy for clinical cure. Tolevamer and vancomycin + FMT seemed to be the most effective in preventing recurrence (87% and 75%, respectively). Conclusion: Vancomycin + FMT is perhaps the most effective option for the treatment and prevention of mrCDI, while tolevamer is also effective in preventing recurrence."

The Japanese Society of Gastroenterology (JSGE) published the first edition of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for IBS in 2015. Much more evidence has accumulated since then, and new pharmacological agents and non-pharmacological methods have been developed. Here, we report the second edition of the JSGE-IBS guidelines comprising 41 questions including 12 background questions on epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnostic criteria, 26 clinical questions on diagnosis and treatment, and 3 questions on future research. For each question, statements with or without recommendations and/or evidence level are given and updated diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms are provided based on new evidence. Algorithms for diagnosis are requisite for patients with chronic abdominal pain or associated symptoms and/or abnormal bowel movement. Colonoscopy is indicated for patients with one or more alarm symptoms/signs, risk factors, and/or abnormal routine examination results. The diagnosis is based on the Rome IV criteria. Step 1 therapy consists of diet therapy, behavioral modification, and gut-targeted pharmacotherapy for 4 weeks. For non-responders, management proceeds to step 2 therapy, which includes a combination of different mechanistic gut-targeted agents and/or psychopharmacological agents and basic psychotherapy for 4 weeks. Step 3 therapy is for non-responders to step 2 and comprises a combination of gut-targeted pharmacotherapy, psychopharmacological treatments, and/or specific psychotherapy. These updated JSGE-IBS guidelines present best practice strategies for IBS patients in Japan and we believe these core strategies can be useful for IBS diagnosis and treatment globally."

There were no date limitations or language restrictions. The following types of studies were included: clinical trials, cohorts, case-control, cross-sectional, clinical series, and case reports. Participants had to meet the following criteria: any sex, any ethnicity, any age, diagnosis of epilepsy, receiving plant-derived, highly purified (> 98% w/w) CBD in a sesame oil-based oral solution for the treatment of seizures. Data extracted from selected records included efficacy, tolerability, and safety outcomes. Results: Five hundred and seventy records were identified by database and trial register searching. Fifty-seven studies were retrieved for detailed assessment, of which 42 were eventually included for the review. The participants of the studies included patients of both pediatric and adult age. Across the trials, purified CBD was administered at dosages up to 50 mg/kg/day. In a randomized double-blind controlled trial in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, CBD was associated with a significantly greater percent reduction in seizure frequency than placebo over the treatment period. Open-label studies suggested the effectiveness of CBD in the treatment of children and adults presenting with other epilepsy syndromes than those addressed by regulatory trials, including CDKL5 deficiency disorder and Aicardi, Dup15q, and Doose syndromes, SYNGAP1 encephalopathy, and epilepsy with myoclonic absences. The most common adverse events observed during treatment with CBD included somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and increased serum aminotransferases. Conclusions: The currently available data suggest that response to treatment with a highly purified, plant-derived CBD oil-based solution can be seen in patients across a broad range of epilepsy disorders and etiologies. The existing evidence can provide preliminary support for additional research."

Data Sources: A MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE (January 1, 1985, to June 19, 2020) literature search was performed using the terms ferric maltol, accrufer, feraccru, iron maltol, ferric trimaltol, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic kidney disease. Additional data sources included prescribing information, abstracts, and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry. Study Selection/Data Extraction: English language literature evaluating FM pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety in the treatment of IDA were reviewed. Data Synthesis: FM is a ferric, non–salt-based oral iron formulation demonstrating improved tolerance in patients with previous intolerance to other iron formulations. Phase 3 trials demonstrated significant improvements in anemia and serum iron parameters in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Common adverse effects were gastrointestinal intolerance. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: FM is an effective and well-tolerated alternative to oral iron salts for patients with IBD or CKD and IDA. Emerging data suggest that FM is noninferior to intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose in patients with IBD and IDA. Prior to selecting FM over IV iron products, consideration should be given to time to normalization of Hb, ease of administration, cost, and tolerability. Conclusion: FM is a relatively safe, effective oral iron therapy that may be better tolerated than other oral iron formulations. FM may be an effective alternative to IV iron in patients with IBD."

An oral option, with gastrointestinal absorption, would overcome any potential fear of injection among patients. Oral semaglutide has been studied in randomized controlled trials within the PIONEER program. From a robust pool of literature with a global patient population, oral semaglutide has been an effective option as monotherapy and combination therapy to improve clinical outcomes, such as A1C and body weight from baseline to week 78, depending on the randomized controlled trial. In addition, a noninferiority result was observed with oral semaglutide versus placebo in a cardiovascular outcomes trial in patients with type 2 diabetes with established cardiovascular disease or risk factors. Similar to injectable glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, transient nausea and vomiting was seen with oral semaglutide. Overall, this new oral option may be a choice for patients with barriers to injectable therapy. This review evaluates and summarizes the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical application of oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes."

Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is associated with reduction in antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) burden in patients without cirrhosis; however, the impact in cirrhosis is unclear. We aimed to study the effect of capsule and enema FMT on ARG abundance in fecal samples, which were collected during two published FMT trials in patients with cirrhosis on rifaximin, lactulose, and proton pump inhibitors. ARGs were identified using metagenomics and mapped against the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database. Changes in ARG abundance were studied within/between groups. The capsule FMT trial involved a one-time FMT or placebo capsule administration with stool collection at baseline and week 4 postintervention. Antibiotics+enema FMT included preprocedure antibiotics followed by FMT enema versus standard-of-care (SOC). Stool was collected at baseline, postantibiotics, and day 7/15 postintervention. Both trials included 20 patients each. There was no safety/infection signal linked to FMT. In the capsule trial, beta-lactamase (OXY/LEN) expression decreased post-FMT versus baseline. Compared to placebo, patients who were post-FMT had lower abundance of vancomycin (VanH), beta-lactamase (ACT), and rifamycin ARGs; the latter was associated with cognitive improvement. No changes were seen within patients treated with placebo. In the antibiotics+enema trial for postantibiotics at day 7 versus baseline, there was an increase in vancomycin and beta-lactamase ARGs, which decreased at day 15. However, quinolone resistance increased at day 15 versus baseline. Between SOC and FMT, day 7 had largely lower ARG (CfxA beta-lactamase, VanW, and VanX) that continued at day 15 (cepA beta-lactamase, VanW). No changes were seen within the SOC group. Conclusion: Despite differences in routes of administration and preintervention antibiotics, we found that ARG abundance is largely reduced after FMT compared to pre-FMT baseline and non-FMT groups in decompensated cirrhosis."

The objective of this study was to evaluate Fecal Calprotectin (FC) and Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) in individuals infected and non-infected with STHs to identify potential intestinal morbidity markers. Methods: Stool from participants diagnosed positive for Trichuris trichiura and concomitant STH infections from three countries was used to perform FC and FOB point-of-care assays. Simultaneously, identified STH negative participants underwent FC and FOB testing as controls. Potential associations between test results and determinants were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Findings: In total, 1034 T. trichiura infected cases (mostly light infections) and 157 STH negative controls were tested for FC and FOB. Among all participants tested, 18·5% had ≥ 50 µg/g FC concentration, while 14 (1·2%) were positive for FOB. No statistically significant association was found between T. trichiura infection or Ascaris lumbricoides co-infection and FC concentration, while an inverse association (odds ratio (OR): 0·45, 95% credible intervals (CrI): 0·26, 0·75) was found between hookworm co-infection and FC concentration. In Lao PDR, the proportion of participants in the ≥ 50 µg/g FC category was significantly higher in the oldest age category compared to the 5–11 years group (OR: 3·31, 95% CrI: 1·62, 7·24). Too few participants were found positive for FOB to derive any conclusions. Interpretation: Studies are needed to better understand the relationship between intestinal morbidity and STH infections. Suitable, standardized, low-cost markers of STH attributable morbidity to better monitor the impact of STH control interventions are necessary. Funding: BMGF (OPP1153928)"

We conducted a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial in a high-risk, highly mobile fishing community (HIV prevalence: approximately 38%) in Rakai, Uganda, to assess the impact of a community health worker-delivered, theory-based (situated Information, Motivation, and Behavior Skills), motivational interviewing-informed, and mobile phone application-supported counseling strategy called “Health Scouts” to promote engagement in HIV treatment and prevention services. Methods and findings The study community was divided into 40 contiguous, randomly allocated clusters (20 intervention clusters, n = 1,054 participants at baseline; 20 control clusters, n = 1,094 participants at baseline). From September 2015 to December 2018, the Health Scouts were deployed in intervention clusters. Community-wide, cross-sectional surveys of consenting 15 to 49-year-old residents were conducted at approximately 15 months (mid-study) and at approximately 39 months (end-study) assessing the primary programmatic outcomes of self-reported linkage to HIV care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, and male circumcision, and the primary biologic outcome of HIV viral suppression (<400 copies/mL). Secondary outcomes included HIV testing coverage, HIV incidence, and consistent condom use. The primary intent-to-treat analysis used log-linear binomial regression with generalized estimating equation to estimate prevalence risk ratios (PRR) in the intervention versus control arm. A total of 2,533 (45% female, mean age: 31 years) and 1,903 (46% female; mean age 32 years) residents completed the mid-study and end-study surveys, respectively. At mid-study, there were no differences in outcomes between arms. At end-study, self-reported receipt of the Health Scouts intervention was 38% in the intervention arm and 23% in the control arm, suggesting moderate intervention uptake in the intervention arm and substantial contamination in the control arm. At end-study, intention-to-treat analysis found higher HIV care coverage (PRR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.10, p = 0.011) and ART coverage (PRR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.10, p = 0.028) among HIV–positive participants in the intervention compared with the control arm. Male circumcision coverage among all men (PRR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.96 to 1.14, p = 0.31) and HIV viral suppression among HIV–positive participants (PRR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.12, p = 0.20) were higher in the intervention arm, but differences were not statistically significant. No differences were seen in secondary outcomes. Study limitations include reliance on self-report for programmatic outcomes and substantial contamination which may have diluted estimates of effect. Conclusions A novel community health worker intervention improved HIV care and ART coverage in an HIV hyperendemic setting but did not clearly improve male circumcision coverage or HIV viral suppression. This community-based, implementation strategy may be a useful component in some settings for HIV epidemic control."
"Rescuing the last-line polymyxins: Achievements and challenges","Nang S.C., Azad M.A.K., Velkov T., Tony Zhou Q., Li J.","Pharmacological Reviews","10.1124/pharmrev.120.000020","73","2","2021","Antibiotic resistance is a major global health challenge and, worryingly, several key Gram negative pathogens can become resistant to most currently available antibiotics. Polymyxins have been revived as a last-line therapeutic option for the treatment of infections caused by multidrugresistant Gram negative bacteria, in particular Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacterales. Polymyxins were first discovered in the late 1940s but were abandoned soon after their approval in the late 1950s as a result of toxicities (e.g., nephrotoxicity) and the availability of “safer” antibiotics approved at that time. Therefore, knowledge on polymyxins had been scarce until recently, when enormous efforts have been made by several research teams around the world to elucidate the chemical, microbiological, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, and toxicological properties of polymyxins. One of the major achievements is the development of the first scientifically based dosage regimens for colistin that are crucial to ensure its safe and effective use in patients. Although the guide-line has not been developed for polymyxin B, a large clinical trial is currently being conducted to optimize its clinical use. Importantly, several novel, safer polymyxin-like lipopeptides are developed to overcome the nephrotoxicity, poor efficacy against pulmonary infections, and narrow therapeutic windows of the currently used polymyxin B and colistin. This review discusses the latest achievements on polymyxins and highlights the major challenges ahead in optimizing their clinical use and discovering new-generation polymyxins. To save lives from the deadly infections caused by Gram negative “superbugs,” every effort must be made to improve the clinical utility of the last-line polymyxins. Significance Statement——Antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to global health. The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections has been highlighted by leading global health organizations and authorities. Polymyxins are a last-line defense against difficult-to-treat MDR Gram negative pathogens. Unfortunately, the pharmacological information onpolymyxinswas very limiteduntil recently. This review provides a comprehensive overview on the major achievements and challenges in polymyxin pharmacology and clinical use and how the recent findings have been employed to improve clinical practice worldwide."

The pathophysiology of DKD involves various pathways like hemodynamic, metabolic, and inflammatory pathways. Increase in reactive oxygen species formation induced by hyperglycemia through activation of electron transport chain considered as the initiators in the development of diabetes complications. Prevalence of DKD is raising continuously with disparate growth in low to middle-income countries and under-recognized as a global burden of disease. DKD imposes an enormous humanistic, economic, and societal burden. DKD in the initial stage is often undiagnosed until the manifestations of serious complications. The major hurdle in the early diagnosis is limited knowledge, unroutine screening. Timely diagnosis and appropriate interventions are the best approaches to deal with this catastrophic condition. Early diagnosis can have lifetime benefits by controlling the progression of the disease, increasing life expectancy, decreasing the humanistic and economic burden. Even after all these benefits; DKD cases are diagnosed when the condition worsens. Non-availability of potential diagnostic biomarkers is the main barrier to the early diagnosis of DKD. The present review highlights the worldwide prevalence, risk factors, and potential biomarkers for the early detection of DKD."

Methods The review was conducted to get eligible published studies from 1(st) January 2016 to 25(th) March 2020 based on PRISMA protocol. A combination of related words from the Medical Subject Heading Terms (MeSH), with (AND, OR) were used to search for published studies reporting the prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Sciences, Google Scholar, and Iranian databases. Then data from the studies were extracted and reported. Results Our study showed that different water sources of hospitals were contaminated with NTMs. The prevalence of RGM isolates in hospital water samples varied between 42.2%–67.5%, and the prevalence of SGM varied between 32.5%–57.7%, respectively. M. lentiflavum (84.7%), M. avium complex (2.8%–56.4%) and M. gordonae (2.8%–56.2%) were the most prevalent NTM species amongst SGM, whereas M. fortuitum (2.9%–44.2%), M. chelonae (8%–36.8%), M. mucogenicum (8%–25.6%) were the most leading NTM isolates among RGM. Conclusions A high prevalence of NTM was reported from hospital environments particularly hospital water sources which can colonize medical devices, solutions, and water used for patients and cause nosocomial infection. Therefore, the hospitals should check the microbiological quality of the water used."

However, several studies documented significant toxic effects induced by preservatives, especially on the ocular surface. Consequently, most of the ophthalmic medications became progressively available in preservative-free (PF) formulations. Areas covered: We analyzed pre-clinical and clinical studies on PF eyedrops with particular attention to common chronic diseases such as dry eye and glaucoma. We discussed about the pros and cons of using PF eyedrops, in terms of efficacy, safety, and social-economic aspects. Expert opinion: There are still unresolved issues that make hard for PF medications to definitively conquer the drug market. Despite robust pre-clinical evidences of less toxicity, the low number of randomized clinical trials does not permit to state that PF eyedrops have, in clinical practice, a similar efficacy or a higher safety compared to preserved forms. These aspects limit their use to chronic diseases requiring long-term therapies with multiple daily instillations, especially in the presence of concomitant ophthalmic diseases that expose to a risk of ocular surface worsening."

Goldenberg S., Merrick B.","Therapeutic Advances in Infectious Disease","10.1177/2049936120981526","8",NA,"2021","Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the transfer of screened and minimally processed faecal material from a ‘healthy’ donor to ‘diseased’ recipient. It has an established role, and is recommended as a therapeutic strategy, in the management of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Recognition that gut dysbiosis is associated with, and may contribute to, numerous disease states has led to interest in exploiting FMT to ‘correct’ this microbial imbalance. Conditions for which it is proposed to be beneficial include inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, liver disease and hepatic encephalopathy, neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety, systemic inflammatory states like sepsis, and even coronavirus disease 2019. To understand what role, if any, FMT may play in the management of these conditions, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of the therapy. Regardless, there are several barriers to its more widespread adoption, which include incompletely understood mechanism of action (especially outside of CDI), inability to standardise treatment, disagreement on its active ingredients and how it should be regulated, and lack of long-term outcome and safety data. Whilst the transfer of faecal material from one individual to another to treat ailments or improve health has a history dating back thousands of years, there are fewer than 10 randomised controlled trials supporting its use. Moving forward, it will be imperative to gather as much data from FMT donors and recipients over as long a timeframe as possible, and for trials to be conducted with rigorous methodology, including appropriate control groups, in order to best understand the utility of FMT for indications beyond CDI. This review discusses the history of FMT, its appreciable mechanisms of action with reference to CDI, indications for FMT with an emerging evidence base above and beyond CDI, and future perspectives on the field."

We undertook a systematic review to characterize the gut microbiome in pancreatitis patients. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for studies on microbiota in pancreatitis published from January 1, 2000 to June 5, 2020. Animal studies, reviews, case reports, and non-English articles were excluded. A frequency analysis was performed for outcomes reported in ≥2 studies and studies were analyzed for risk of bias and quality of evidence. Results: 22 papers met inclusion criteria; 15 included AP, 7 included CP. No studies were appropriately designed to assess whether alterations in the gut microbiome exacerbate pancreatitis or develop as a result of pancreatitis. We did identify several patterns of microbiome changes that are associated with pancreatitis. The gut microbiome demonstrated decreased alpha diversity in 3/3 A P studies and 3/3 C P studies. Beta diversity analysis revealed differences in bacterial community composition in the gut microbiome in 2/2 A P studies and 3/3 C P studies. Functionally, gut microbiome changes were associated with infectious pathways in AP and CP. Several studies suffered from high risk of bias and inadequate quality. Conclusions: Detecting differences in microbial composition associated with AP and CP may represent a diagnostic tool. Appropriately controlled longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether microbiome changes are causative or reactive in pancreatitis."

Excessive and prolonged alcohol use leads to ALD, which ranges from early forms such as alcoholic fatty liver (AFL) and alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), through progressive fibrosis to cirrhosis and the development of hepatocellular cancer (HCC). In addition, patients with underlying ALD and continuous alcohol use can develop alcoholic hepatitis (AH), which presents a rapid progression of liver failure and has a high short-term mortality. Genetic, environmental and epigenetic factors influence the progression of ALD to more severe forms. The pathogenesis of ALD is complex and involves multiple pathways. Recent translational studies have demonstrated a key role of the gut-liver axis and innate immunity in hepatocellular damage and fibrosis. In severe forms of AH, hepatocellular de-differentiation and systemic inflammation contribute to liver failure and multiorgan failure. Alcohol abstinence is the cornerstone of therapy for ALD and the prevention of its complications, but the efficacy and accessibility of psycho-familial-social interventions is still poor and effective public health policies to limit problematic alcohol use need to be implemented. Prednisolone is the only current option for AH, with a transient beneficial effect over placebo. For patients with decompensated ALD-cirrhosis and/or development of HCC, liver transplantation (LT) may be required. In recent years, early LT is being increasingly offered to carefully selected AH patients, with excellent long-term survival. New trials of AH treatments are currently ongoing, and translational studies in human samples are paving the way to new promising targeted therapies."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on postoperative outcomes of a preoperative screening and decolonization strategy of nasal carriers for Staphylococcus aureus prior to lung cancer surgery. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study comparing 2 cohorts of patients undergoing major lung resection: a control group of patients from the placebo arm of the randomized Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Chlorhexidine Mouthwashes operated on between July 2012 and April 2015 without any nasopharyngeal screening (N = 224); an experimental group, with preoperative screening for S. aureus of nasal carriers and selective 5-day decolonization in positive carriers using mupirocin ointment between January 2017 and December 2017 (N = 310). The 2 groups were matched according to a propensity score analysis with 1:1 matching. The primary outcome was the rate of postoperative HAIs, and the secondary outcome was the need for postoperative mechanical ventilation after surgery. RESULTS: After matching, 2 similar groups of 108 patients each were obtained. In the experimental group, 26 patients had positive results for nasal carriage, and a significant decrease was observed in the rate of overall postoperative HAIs [control n = 19, 17.6%; experimental group n = 9, 8.3%; P = 0.043; relative risk 0.47 (0.22-1)] and in the rate of postoperative mechanical ventilation [control n = 12, 11.1%; experimental group n = 4, 3.7%; P = 0.038; relative risk 0.33 (0.11-1)]. After logistic regression and multivariable analysis, screening of S. aureus nasal carriers reduced the rate of HAIs [odds ratio (OR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11-0.76; P = 0.01] and reduced the risk of the need for postoperative mechanical ventilation (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05-0.74; P = 0.02). There was no significant statistical difference between the 2 groups regarding the rate of postoperative S. aureus-associated infection (control group n = 6, 5.6%; experimental group n = 2, 1.9%; P = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: Identification of nasal carriers of S. aureus and selective decontamination using mupirocin appeared to have a beneficial effect on postoperative infectious events after lung resection surgery."
"Fecal microbiota transplantation in hepatic encephalopathy: a systematic review","Madsen M., Kimer N., Bendtsen F., Petersen A.M.","Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology","10.1080/00365521.2021.1899277","56","5","2021","Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a reversible neurocognitive dysfunction that ranges in severity from subclinical alterations to coma. Patients with chronic liver disease are predisposed to HE due to metabolic failure and portosystemic shunting of toxins, of which ammonia is believed to be the main toxic chemical. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may reduce ammonia synthesis by altering the gut microbiota composition to a taxon low in urease, diminish uptake of ammonia by reestablishing the integrity of the intestinal barrier and increase ammonia clearance by improving liver function. In this systematic review, we summarize the insights of the current literature examining FMT as a treatment for HE. PubMed and EMBASE were searched on 08 February 2021 using the MeSH terms ‘fecal microbiota transplantation & hepatic encephalopathy’ and the abbreviations ‘FMT & HE’. Eight studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria, comprising two randomized clinical trials, three case reports and three rodent studies. Thirty-nine patients with HE were treated with FMT. Thirty-nine rodents received FMT in laboratory tests. FMT improved neurocognitive test results in four human studies and two rodent studies. Microbiota originating from donors was found in human recipients one year post-FMT. Readmission of patients was lower after treatment with FMT compared to standard of care. FMT may improve neurocognitive function and reduce serious adverse events in patients with HE, but the studies conducted so far have been small and their long-term follow-up is limited. Large-scale, randomized and controlled trials are needed to validate and help standardize the clinical application of FMT in cases of HE."
"Relevance of monitoring transmural disease activity in patients with Crohn’s disease: current status and future perspectives","Wilkens R., Novak K.L., Maaser C., Panaccione R., Kucharzik T.","Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology","10.1177/17562848211006672","14",NA,"2021","Treatment targets of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) have evolved over the last decade. Goals of therapy consisting of symptom control and steroid sparing have shifted to control of disease activity with endoscopic remission being an important endpoint. Unfortunately, this requires ileocolonoscopy, an invasive procedure. Biomarkers [C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FCP)] have emerged as surrogates for endoscopic remission and disease activity, but also have limitations. Despite this evolution, we must not lose sight that CD involves transmural inflammation, not fully appreciated with ileocolonoscopy. Therefore, transmural assessment of disease activity by cross-sectional imaging, in particular with magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) and intestinal ultrasonography (IUS), is vital to fully understand disease control. Bowel-wall thickness (BWT) is the cornerstone in assessment of transmural inflammation and BWT normalization, with or without bloodflow normalization, the key element demonstrating resolution of transmural inflammation, namely transmural healing (TH) or transmural remission (TR). In small studies, achievement of TR has been associated with improved long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced hospitalization, surgery, escalation of treatment, and a decrease in clinical relapse over endoscopic remission alone. This review will focus on the existing literature investigating the concept of TR or residual transmural disease and its relation to other existing treatment targets. Current data suggest that TR may be the next logical step in the evolution of treatment targets."

The rise of resistant pathogen strains, combined with a reduction of microbiota diversity upon antibiotic treatment, has become a significant obstacle in the fight against invasive infections worldwide. Alternative and complementary strategies to classical “Fleming antibiotics” comprise microbiota-based treatments such as fecal microbiota transfer and administration of probiotics, live-biotherapeutics, prebiotics, and postbiotics. Other promising interventions, whose efficacy may also be influenced by the human microbiota, are phages and vaccines. They will facilitate antimicrobial stewardship, to date the only globally applied antibiotic resistance mitigation strategy. In this review, we present the available evidence on these nontraditional interventions, highlight their interaction with the human microbiota, and discuss their clinical applicability."

The rate of IE after TAVI is similar to that after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), but mortality and prevalence of Enterococcus spp. as causing pathogens are significantly higher. Guidelines on infection prevention measures before TAVI procedures are currently lacking. We performed a structured review of the available data to provide interim recommendations based on guidelines to prevent infections issued by the World Health Organization as well as guidelines by professional societies from Europe and the USA. Such interim recommendations based on expert opinions are probably justified until large randomised trials provide strong evidence for infection control in TAVI, because IE after TAVI is often related to the TAVI procedure itself and the associated mortality rate is high. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be adapted from an intravenous cephalosporin to, e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, to cover enterococci. In addition, infection control should follow operating room standards as far as is reasonable, even if the evidence for this recommendation is very low. These recommendations are endorsed by the International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases (ISCVID)."
"Emergence of varicella-zoster virus resistance to acyclovir: epidemiology, prevention, and treatment","Shiraki K., Takemoto M., Daikoku T.","Expert Review of Anti-Infective Therapy","10.1080/14787210.2021.1917992","19","11","2021","Introduction: Acyclovir has led to the development of successful systemic therapy for herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection, and the use of valacyclovir and famciclovir has improved treatment. Additionally, the use of a helicase-primase (HP) inhibitor (HPI), amenamevir, is changing the treatment of herpes zoster (HZ). Area covered: VZV infection is prevented by vaccines and is treated with antiviral agents. Acyclovir and penciclovir are phosphorylated by viral thymidine kinase and work as chain terminators. Improvements in the management of immunocompromised patients have reduced severe and prolonged immunosuppression and chronic VZV infection with acyclovir-resistant mutants has become rarer. The HP is involved in the initial step of DNA synthesis and amenamevir has novel mechanisms of action, efficacy to acyclovir-resistant mutants, and pharmacokinetic characteristics. The literature search for PUBMED was conducted on 10 April 2020 and updated on 4 November 2020. Expert opinion: Amenamevir has been used to treat HZ in Japan. Although the number of patients with VZV infection will decrease owing to the use of vaccines, the addition of HPI will improve treatment and treatment options for resistant viruses. The clinical use of HPIs in addition to current nucleoside analogs opens a new era of antiherpes therapy."
"Paediatrics: How to manage viral gastroenteritis","Leung A.K.C., Hon K.L.","Drugs in Context","10.7573/DIC.2020-11-7","10",NA,"2021","Background: Viral gastroenteritis is the most common diarrhoeal disorder seen in general practice and emergency departments. This article aims to provide a narrative updated review on the evaluation and management of viral gastroenteritis in children. Methods: A PubMed search was performed with Clinical Queries using the key term 'viral gastroenteritis'. The search strategy included clinical trials, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, observational studies and reviews. The search was restricted to the English literature and the paediatric population. Results: Acute viral gastroenteritis is usually self-limiting. However, it can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance if not properly treated. Adequate fluids containing physiological concentrations of glucose and electrolytes should be provided to compensate for gastrointestinal losses and cover maintenance needs. Oral rehydration therapy is as effective as intravenous (IV) fluid therapy for rehydration for children with mild-to-moderate dehydration. Measurements of serum electrolytes, creatinine and glucose are usually not necessary and should only be considered in a subset of children with severe dehydration who require hospitalization and IV therapy. Judicious use of ondansetron can increase the success rate of oral rehydration therapy and minimize the need for IV therapy and hospitalization. Conclusion: Acute viral gastroenteritis is associated with substantial morbidity in developed countries and significant mortality in developing countries. Physicians should educate caregivers on proper personal hygiene and handwashing to prevent faecal to oral transmission of the pathogen as well as the importance of rotavirus vaccine in the prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis. Several norovirus vaccines are currently undergoing clinical trials with promising results. It is hoped that development of an effective norovirus vaccine will further reduce the incidence of viral gastroenteritis."

Methods: The PubMed, EmBase, Cochrane library, and CNKI were systematically searched throughout March 2020 for randomized controlled trials evaluating the therapeutic effects of TAC versus CTX for IMN patients treated with steroids. The pooled relative risks (RRs) and weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random-effects model. Results: Twelve trials recruited a total of 868 IMN patients were identified and contained in final meta-analysis. Patients in TAC group was associated with an increased incidence of overall remission (12 trials: 868 patients; RR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.11–1.31; p < 0.001) and complete remission (12 trials: 868 patients; RR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.25–1.80; p < 0.001). Moreover, we noted TAC therapy significantly reduced urinary protein excretion (9 trials: 567 patients; WMD: −1.06; 95%CI: −1.41 to −0.71; p < 0.001), and increased serum albumin (9 trials: 567 patients; WMD: 5.37; 95%CI: 2.97 to 7.77; p < 0.001) than CTX therapy. Furthermore, no significant difference between TAC and CTX for serum creatinine was detected (6 trials: 378 patients; WMD: 0.15; 95%CI: −3.46 to 3.75; p = 0.936).

We compared faecal microbiota of newly diagnosed treatment-naïve overweight and obese cancer patients and matched controls. Cases were enrolled in presurgical weight-loss trials for breast (NCT02224807) and prostate (NCT01886677) cancers and had a body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m(2). Cancer-free controls were matched 1:1 by age (±5 years), race, gender, and BMI (±5 kg/m(2)). All participants provided faecal samples; isolated bacterial DNA were PCR amplified at the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and analysed using the QIIME pipeline. Tests compared cases versus controls, then separately by gender. Microbial alpha-diversity and beta-diversity were assessed, and relative abundance of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU’s) were compared at the genus level, with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. 22 overweight and obese cancer patients were matched with 22 cancer-free controls, with an average BMI of 30.5±4.3 kg/m(2), age 54.4±5.3 years, and 54.5% were black. Fourteen matches were made between breast cancer cases and healthy female controls, and 8 matches were made with prostate cancer cases and healthy male controls. Comparison of all cases and controls revealed no differences in alpha diversity, though prostate cancer patients had higher Chao1 (P=0.006) and Observed Species (P=0.036) than cancer-free males. Beta-diversity metrics were significantly different between cases and controls (P<0.03 for all tests in whole sample and in men), though only unweighted Unifrac was different in women (P=0.005). Kruskal Wallis tests indicated significant differences among 16 genera in all matches, 9 in female, and 51 in male.

Although the literature is replete with studies demonstrating its efficacy, the use of probiotics in dentistry continues to polarise opinion. Here, we explore the evidence for probiotics and its effect on periodontal and peri-implant health. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were systemically searched from June 2010 to June 2020 based on a formulated search strategy. Of 1,956 potentially relevant articles, we selected 27 double-blinded randomised clinical trials in the areas of gingivitis, periodontitis, residual pockets during supportive periodontal therapy, and peri-implant diseases, and reviewed their efficacy in these clinical situations. We observed substantial variation in treatment results and protocols between studies. Overall, the evidence for probiotic therapy for periodontal and peri-implant health appears unconvincing. The scarcity of trials with adequate power and follow-up precludes any meaningful clinical recommendations. Thus, the routine use of probiotics for these purposes are currently unsubstantiated. Further multi-centre trials encompassing a standardised investigation on the most promising strains and administration methods, with longer observation times are required to confirm the benefits of probiotic therapy for these applications."

Encapsulated administration may be equivalent in efficacy to delivery through other routes. Methods: A systematic review was undertaken of studies using encapsulated FMT up to 26 October 2020. Data on indication, clinical outcomes, safety, treatment protocol and capsule preparation were collected and reported. Pooled rates of clinical efficacy in rCDI were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. The impact of single variables on clinical efficacy was evaluated using univariate meta-regression. Results: A total of 35 studies reporting the treatment of 960 patients with encapsulated FMT for eight different indications met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (n = 18, 51%) and patients (n = 755, 79%) were from studies on rCDI. Cure rates after single and multiple courses of treatments with encapsulated FMT in rCDI were 85% (95% CI: 82%-88%) and 93% (95% CI: 88%-96%) respectively. The treatment outcome was not significantly affected by dose, number of delivered capsules, anaerobic/aerobic processing, single/multi-donor treatment, lyophilisation, or any other single factor in the production or delivery of encapsulated FMT. Promising but non-comparable results from the treatment of ulcerative colitis and multidrug-resistant organisms were reported. Conclusions: Encapsulated FMT is an effective and safe treatment of rCDI, with cure rates comparable to FMT delivered through other routes. The treatment is effective despite variations in donor screening, preparation and treatment protocol. For other indications, the role of FMT capsules is still not sufficiently examined, although some studies show promising results. Plain Language Summary: Transfer of faecal material through capsules in the treatment of various diseases. Evidence for clinical efficacy The bacteria and other microorganisms of the gut is different in patient with various diseases in comparison with healthy subjects. Therefore, ways to change the microorganisms of the gut in a beneficial direction has been the subject of various research projects within recent years. Faecal microbiota transplantation often referred as FMT is a method of transferring microorganisms from healthy donors to patients with various diseases and is seen as one way to change the microbial community of the gut in a beneficial direction. Faecal microbiota transplantation can be performed in different ways such as through endoscopy, enemas or capsules. The transfer through capsules is preferred by the patients and has advantages since it can be administered long-term and can be delivered to the patients in their home. In this paper, we evaluated all accessible research reporting treatment with encapsulated faecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of various diseases. We report the following major findings: -Treatment with capsules is safe when guidelines for screening donors and testing faecal material is followed. -The treatment is highly effective in the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection, a disease with high mortality often caused by repeated antibiotic treatments. The treatment was effective in 596 of 723 patients following one course of capsule treatment. -Faecal microbiota transplantation delivered through capsules is as effective as treatment delivered through other routes in the treatment of C. difficile infection. -The treatment is effective in the treatment of C. difficile infection across studies and countries, despite great differences in the ways the capsules were prepared and delivered. -Increasing the amount of faecal material used in the production did not affect the efficacy of the treatment. -There are promising results in the treatment of other diseases such as liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease and the treatment of multi-drug resistant bacteria."

As no specific approved treatment options are available for the COVID-19 infection, several existing antiviral drugs in combination with others have become the mainstay therapy. The targets for the treatment of the infection include viral targets such as polymerases, spike glycoproteins, membrane proteins, and viral envelope and host targets such as host proteases and host receptors. Antiviral agents, immunomodulatory agents, and empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics can be used as treatment therapies for the infection. Convalescent plasma therapy has also been proposed as an effective treatment for COVID-19. Additionally, many studies are ongoing to develop a potent and effective vaccine that completely blocks SARS-CoV-2. Never-theless, prevention of spread of the virus remains the first and foremost step towards controlling and managing the coronavirus infection."

Behcet's disease (BD) is an autoimmune disease of systemic vasculitis with an unclear pathogenesis. Although western medicines remain the mainstay interventions, effectiveness and safety are significant challenges. Complementary and alternative medicine, including herbal medicine, are gaining more attention. Chinese medicine decoctions, which have been used for centuries, are the most common form of traditional therapies. Objective. The purpose of the review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicine decoctions in the treatment of BD. Methods. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for BD treatment with Chinese medicine decoctions were searched in six electronic databases until March 2021. Primary outcomes were total effective rate, recovery rate, and recurrence rate. Secondary outcomes were clinical feature scores (oral ulcers, eye lesions, genital ulcers, skin lesions, arthropathies, fever, and pathergy reactions) and laboratory index levels (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and immunoglobulin A). The risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Handbook, and a meta-analysis was performed with RevMan 5.4.1. Results. Sixteen RCTs with 924 patients were included in the review. The meta-analysis indicated that Chinese medicine decoctions were effective for BD when compared with control groups for all the primary outcomes and 7/10 of the secondary outcomes. Adverse events were reported in 11 of the 16 RCTs, with the Chinese medicine decoctions possibly having fewer adverse events than western drugs. This review included a range of classical prescriptions. An additional meta-analysis of modified Gancao Xiexin Decoction for BD treatment was conducted. Gancao Xiexin decoction is also discussed as a representative prescription, as well as high-frequency herbs, and warrants further exploration for individualized medicine and pharmacology. Conclusion. Chinese medicine decoctions have the potential to be effective and safe for treating BD. However, additional well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm the findings because of the unsatisfactory quality of the included studies."

The clinical spectrum of CDI is broad, ranging from asymptomatic to deadly fulminant colitis. When associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), CDI is more prevalent and more severe than in the general population, due to specific risk factors such as impaired immune system, intestinal dysmotility, high antibiotic use leading to disturbed microbiota, frequent hospitalization, and PPI use. We performed a systematic review on the issue of prevention and treatment of CDI in the CKD population, analysing the suitable randomized controlled cohort studies published between 2000 and 2021. The results show that the most important aspect of prevention is isolation and disinfection with chlorine-based solution and hydrogen peroxide vapour to stop the spread of bacteria. In terms of prevention, using Lactobacillus plantarum (LP299v) proved to be more efficient than disinfection measures in transplant patients, leading to higher cure rates and less recurrent episodes of CDI. Treatment with oral fidaxomycin is more effective than with oral vancomycin for the initial episode of CDI in CKD patients. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is more effective than vancomycin in recurrent CDI in CKD patients. More large-sample RCTs are necessary to conclude on the best treatment and prevention strategy of CDI in CKD patients."

But during the last few years, a downward trend has been observed globally, except in some European countries and Asia. Until recently, C. difficile was the primary cause of nosocomial infection following antibiotic exposure, presenting a high rate of mortality and morbidity. However, the emergence and spread of a hypervirulent strain (BI/NAP1/027) and an increase in the incidence of community-acquired C. difficile infection (CDI), especially in populations not previously considered at high risk, have contributed to alterations in the infection epidemiology. After initial treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, CDI recurrence is the cause of substantial morbidity, indicating that alternative strategies to the usual therapeutics are urgently needed. Several studies have investigated probiotics to assess their preventative and/or prophylactic effects on CDI, but their use is still controversial. Other anti-infective alternatives, such as bacteriocins and phage therapy, appear as promising answers for CDI treatment. This review explores the current therapy approaches and the advances in searching for alternative solutions to inhibit the opportunistic pathogen C. difficile."

Shen Ling Bai Zhu San (SLBZS) is a botanical formulation used in traditional Chinese medicine to manage diarrhea. This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the available evidence of anti-diarrheal efficacy of SLBZS. Methods: Both English and Chinese language databases were searched through April 20, 2020 for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Fourteen RCTs involving 1,158 participants were included. Reported outcomes included stool frequency, stool consistency, patient-reported satisfaction of chronic diarrhea treatment, and adverse events (AEs). Controls used were prescription drugs and in one study placebo SLBZS. Results: Quality of the studies ranged from low to high risk of bias. One small study reported SLBZ's effects on objective outcomes (no significant reduction in stool frequency but a significant improvement in stool consistency in week 12, when compared to placebo). Meta-analysis showed that SLBZS with or without conventionalmedicine was associated with higher patient-reported satisfaction compared to conventional medicine (RR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.40 to 3.29; p = 0.0004; I2 =0%; and RR, 2.34; 95%CI, 1.84 to 2.97; p < 0.00001, I2 = 0). The risk of AEs was not greater with SLBZS (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.84; p = 0.009; I2 =0%). Conclusions: This systematic review found that treatment with SLBZS significantly improved patient-reported satisfaction. Well-designed RCTs with larger sample sizes, lower bias, and strong primary endpoints are needed to further determine the efficacy of SLBZS in reducing stool frequency, and in improving stool consistency for specific gastrointestinal disease."
"Solithromycin as a potential novel antibiotic against Neisseria gonorrhoeae resistance","Habiburrahman M., Soetikno V., Sirait W.R., Savira M.","Indonesian Journal of Pharmacy","10.22146/ijp.1123","31","4","2020","Gonorrhea is one of the most often sexually transmitted infection in the world. In 2016, WHO stated the Southeast Asia region as the fourth-highest incidence rate and prevalence of gonorrhea. One of the current problems with gonorrhea is related to its emerging resistance to first-line drugs such as cephalosporins, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones. This resistance has an impact on the difficulty of finding effective antibiotics to eradicate the infection, thus risking financial loss and infertility in sexually active age patients. This literature review will discuss solithromycin, the first fluoroketolide in phase III clinical trial, and show its potential as a new antibiotic against infection with resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Literatures are searched using Pubmed and Google Scholar search engines with keywords: antibiotics, CEM-101, clinical trial, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, new treatment, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, resistance, safety, and solithromycin. This semisynthetic antibiotic is supported by a different chemical structure from previous macrolides; improving solithromycin becomes more stable and able to bind easier with bacterial ribosomes. Pharmacologically, solithromycin provides an advantage in its high bioavailability, easy oral administration route, wide distribution, metabolism mainly in the liver, but not required dosage adjustments due to hepatic impairment, and a single dosage preparation that can increase patient compliance in healing gonorrhea infections. Also, its lower MIC50 than previous antibiotics makes it well-tolerated, therefore making this antibiotic as a potential recommendation for the management of multi-drug resistant gonorrhea in the future. Solithromycin is not inferior to the standard therapy (ceftriaxone and azithromycin), with 80% vs. 84% gonorrhea eradication rates. Per the anatomic site, the eradication rate is 92% in genital, 94% in the pharynx, and 83% in the rectum. However, special attention needs to be paid to the side effects of the gastrointestinal tract of solithromycin, as observed in phase III clinical trials at a dose of 1000 mg in the form of diarrhea (24%) and nausea (21%)."

"Colonic diverticular disease","Tursi A., Scarpignato C., Strate L.L., Lanas A., Kruis W., Lahat A., Danese S.","Nature Reviews Disease Primers","10.1038/s41572-020-0153-5","6","1","2020","Diverticula are outpouchings of the intestinal wall and are common anatomical alterations detected in the human colon. Colonic diverticulosis (the presence of diverticula in the colon; referred to as diverticulosis) remains asymptomatic in most individuals but ~25% of individuals will develop symptomatic diverticulosis, termed colonic diverticular disease (also known as diverticular disease). Diverticular disease can range in severity from symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) to symptomatic disease with complications such as acute diverticulitis or diverticular haemorrhage. Since the early 2000s, a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of diverticulosis and diverticular disease, which encompasses genetic alterations, chronic low-grade inflammation and gut dysbiosis, has led to improvements in diagnosis and management. Diagnosis of diverticular disease relies on imaging approaches, such as ultrasonography, CT and MRI, as biomarkers alone are insufficient to establish a diagnosis despite their role in determining disease severity and progression as well as in differential diagnosis. Treatments for diverticular disease include dietary fibre, pharmacological treatments such as antibiotics (rifaximin), anti-inflammatory drugs (mesalazine) and probiotics, alone or in combination, and eventually surgery. Despite being effective in treating primary disease, their effectiveness in primary and secondary prevention of complications is still uncertain."
"Interventions to reduce contaminated aerosols produced during dental procedures for preventing infectious diseases: A cochrane review","Nagraj S.K., Eachempati P., Paisi M., Nasser M., Sivaramakrishnan G., Verbeek J.H.","Dental Cadmos","10.19256/d.cadmos.10.2020.05","88","10","2020","BACKGROUND Many dental procedures produce aerosols that harbour various pathogenic micro-organisms and may pose a risk for the spread of infections between dentist and patient. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to greater concern about this risk. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of methods used during dental treatment procedures to minimize aerosol production and reduce or neutralize contamination in aerosols. SEARCH METHODS The following databases were searched on 17 September 2020: Cochrane Oral Health’s Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library, 2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946); Embase Ovid (from 1980); the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease; the US National Insti tutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov); the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register. SELECTION CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on aero sol-generating procedures (AGPs) performed by dental healthcare providers that evaluated methods to reduce contaminated aerosols in dental clinics (excluding pre-procedural mouthrinses). The primary outcomes were incidence of infection in dental staff or patients, and reduction in volume and level of contaminated aerosols in the operative environment. The secondary outcomes were cost, accessibility and feasibility. MAIN RESULTS We included 16 studies with 425 participants aged 5 to 69 years (8 studies at high risk of bias). No studies measured infection. All studies measured bacterial contamination using the surrogate outcome of colony-forming units (CFU). The results described below should be interpreted with caution, as the evidence is very low certainty due to heterogeneity, risk of bias, small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals. Moreover, we do not know the minimal clinically important difference in CFU. Use of a high-volume evacuator (HVE) may reduce bacterial contamination in aerosols less than one foot from a patient’s mouth, but not at longer distances (3 splitmouth RCTs, 122 participants). One RCT (50 participants) found that there may be no difference in CFU between a combination system (Isolite) and a saliva ejector during AGPs or after AGPs. One split-mouth RCT (10 participants) found that there may be a reduction in CFU with rubber dam at one metre and two-metre distance. One RCT of 47 dental students found use of rubber dam may make no difference in CFU at the forehead and occipital region of the operator. One split-mouth RCT (21 participants) found that rubber dam plus HVE may reduce CFU more than cotton roll plus HVE on the patient’s chest and dental unit light. One split-mouth CCT (2 participants) used a local stand-alone air cleaning system (ACS), which may reduce aerosol contamination during cavity preparation or ultrasonic scaling. Another CCT (50 participants) found that laminar flow in the dental clinic combined with a HEPA filter may reduce contamination approximately 76 cm from the floor and 20 cm to 30 cm from the patient’s mouth. Two RCTs evaluated use of anti microbial coolants during ultra sonic scaling. Compared with dis tilled water, coolant-containing chlorhexidine (CHX), cinnamon extract coolant or povidone iodine may reduce CFU. AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS We found no studies that evaluated disease transmission via aerosols in a dental setting; and no evidence about viral contamination in aerosols. All of the included studies measured bacterial contamination using CFU. There appeared to be some benefit from the interventions, but the available evidence is very low certainty so we are unable to draw reliable conclusions."

This virus is transmitted by air and, therefore, clinical practices with the production of contaminant aerosols are highly at risk. The purpose of this review was to assess the effectiveness of bio-inspired systems, as adjuvants to nonsurgical periodontal therapy, in order to formulate bio-inspired protocols aimed at restoring optimal condition, reducing bacteremia and aerosols generation. Methods: A comprehensive and bibliometric review of articles published in English. Research of clinical trials (RCTs) were included with participants with chronic or aggressive periodontal disease, that have compared benefits for nonsurgical periodontal therapy (NSPT). Results: Seventy-four articles have been included. For probing depth (PPD) there was a statically significant improvement in laser, probiotic, chlorhexidine groups, such as gain in clinical attachment level (CAL). Bleeding on probing (BOP) reduction was statistically significant only for probiotic and chlorhexidine groups. There were changes in microbiological and immunological parameters. Conclusions: The use of bio-inspired systems in nonsurgical periodontal treatment may be useful in reducing risk of bacteremia and aerosol generation, improving clinical, microbiological and immunological parameters, of fundamental importance in a context of global pandemic, where the reduction of bacterial load in aerosols becomes a pivotal point of clinical practice, but other clinical trials are necessary to achieve statistical validity."

In recent years, the incidence of ulcerative colitis presents an increasing trend year by year. Acupuncture, as a potential effective treatment for ulcerative colitis, is widely used in clinical practice. Methods: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Chinese CBM Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese VIP Information, and Wanfang Database from the date of the establishment of each database up to March, 2019. We included randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT) comparing acupuncture versus conventional conventional medicine or comparing acupuncture combined with conventional medicine versus conventional medicine in participants with ulcerative colitis. Two authors screened all references, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data independently. We summarized data using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for binary outcomes. We performed meta-analyses using random effects model. We assessed overall quality of evidence using GRADE. Results: We included 13 RCTs (1030 participants, 515 in the acupuncture group and 515 in the control group). Only one study tested head acupuncture, and the other 12 tested body acupuncture. The treatment duration ranged from 14 to 60 days. Seven trials compared acupuncture alone versus conventional medicine, and six compared acupuncture combined with conventional medicine versus conventional medicine. Acupuncture combined with mesalazine showed better clinical effect (improved clinical symptoms, colonoscopy results and stool examination results) (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.41; 232 participants; 4 trials; low quality evidence) and better colonoscopy curative effect (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.71; 108 participants; 2 trials; moderate quality evidence) compared to mesalazine. Acupuncture showed better clinical effect compared to the combination of metronidazole and sulfasalazine (RR 1.21, 95%CI 1.10, 1.34; 318 participants; 3 trials; moderate quality evidence). There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between groups. Conclusions: Both acupuncture alone and acupuncture combined with conventional medicine may be effective in treating ulcerative colitis compared to conventional medicine. Our findings must be interpreted with caution due to high or unclear risk of bias of the included trials."

Veverimer (formerly referred to as TRC101), a drug candidate for which Tricida, Inc is seeking approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, is a novel nonabsorbable polymer that binds hydrogen cations and chloride anions in the gastrointestinal tract and then is excreted fecally, thereby increasing serum bicarbonate concentration without administering sodium. We examine the published evidence on the investigational use of veverimer in patients with chronic kidney disease and metabolic acidosis. We highlight the achieved increase in serum bicarbonate concentration without coadministering sodium, effects on physical functioning, and the safety record of the drug. We also scrutinize certain unanticipated findings: a lack of dose dependency in the increase in serum bicarbonate concentration observed and that despite the presumed large hydrogen chloride losses in feces, veverimer induces an isochloremic increase in serum bicarbonate concentration that is accompanied by a decrease in serum anion gap. We propose likely explanations for these puzzling findings and raise questions about veverimer's mode of action and its potential interaction with colonic bacterial flora. Additional work is required to fill these knowledge gaps that could have important clinical implications."

Although rates of surgery have shown a temporal decrease globally because of the increasing availability of new drugs and early initiation of effective therapy, health-care costs associated with IBD have continued to rise. The increase in IBD prevalence in resource-limited countries poses a substantial health-care burden. Drugs are not universally accessible or available. An optimised and practical management strategy of IBD in resource-limited countries in Asia is urgently needed. Special consideration should be made to balance the risk of undertreatment (and suboptimal disease control) because of financial constraints with the risk of overtreatment, which is associated with side-effects and costly therapeutics. In this Series paper, we summarise the current approach in optimising conventional therapies, use of other therapies, and de-escalation of biologics in low-resource settings in Asia. The long-term objective is to strive for more effective and affordable therapies with sustained durability of benefit."
"The impact of antibiotic-mediated modification of the intestinal microbiome on outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation: Systematic review and meta-analysis","Gavriilaki M., Sakellari I., Anagnostopoulos A., Gavriilaki E.","Bone Marrow Transplantation","10.1038/s41409-020-01120-w","55",NA,"2020","Background: Accumulating evidence point towards a protective role of intestinal microbiota diversity on outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). Methods: The primary outcome of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to measure the effect of the intestinal microbiome modification caused by antibiotics on main alloHCT outcomes [graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), treatment-related mortality (TRM), overall survival (OS)]. The secondary outcome concerns the association of antibiotic-mediated disruption of microbiota as indicated by microbiome markers with alloHCT outcomes. We searched MEDLINE, COCHRANE, EMBASE through 14th of October 2019 for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case-control or cohort (prospective/ retrospective) studies that investigate the role of antibiotics and microbiome (as expressed though cultures or markers) on alloHCT outcomes. We excluded only editorials, case report/series studies and narrative reviews. Two independent reviewers screened, extracted data and assessed risk of bias (RoB). Results: Among 402 screened references, 23 studies we deemed eligible for qualitative synthesis; 15 of which were included in meta-analysis. The impact of gut decontamination (measured by genomic or non-genomic markers of microbiota diversity) on GVHD or OS has been analyzed in 14 studies; among them 2 were RCTs. In studies with non-genomic markers, the gut decontamination group tended to have a favorable outcome despite the lack of statistical significance [OR 0.42 (0.13, 1.27), I2= 48%, p=0.12, Graph]. However, in recent studies which used genomic markers, the occurrence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was significantly reduced in patients not receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics as prophylaxis or treatment [OR 1.59 (1.22, 2.08), I2= 0%, p=0.0006, Graph]. When we incorporated RoB on the outcome of intestinal GVHD, we found a positive correlation of intestinal GVHD with gut decontamination [OR 1.77 (1.29, 2.44), I2= 0%, p=0.004]. Patients who received antibiotics as prophylaxis or treatment of neutropenic fever had 10% reduction on OS [RR 0.90 (0.77, 1.06), I2= 78%, p=0.23] compared with controls. Nevertheless, heterogeneity remained high and the outcome was not statistically significant even after the incorporation of RoB, or subgroup analysis of genomic versus non-genomic microbiota methods. Moreover, we confirmed that antibiotic administration increased the risk of TRM by 75% [RR 1.75 (0.96, 3.17), I2= 75%, p=0.07]. Patients with higher microbiota diversity had 86% increase in OS compared to patients with lower diversity [RR 1.86 (0.94, 3.66), p=0.07]. Nevertheless, heterogeneity was high (I2= 88%) due to the lack of a unanimous approach regarding the definition of microbiota diversity. Unfortunately, data were not sufficient to estimate the effect of microbiota on TRM. Conclusions: Our systematic review and meta-analysis confirms that broad-spectrum antibiotics increase the incidence of acute GVHD. Similarly, gut decontamination increases the risk of intestinal GVHD. Despite trends toward statistical significance, available data are not sufficient to support an association of microbiota diversity with TRM and OS. Further RCTs using standardized markers of microbiota diversity are needed to clarify its impact on survival."

The condition affects between 5% and 10% of otherwise healthy individuals at any one point in time and, in most people, runs a relapsing and remitting course. The best described risk factor is acute enteric infection, but irritable bowel syndrome is also more common in people with psychological comorbidity and in young adult women than in the rest of the general population. The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome is incompletely understood, but it is well established that there is disordered communication between the gut and the brain, leading to motility disturbances, visceral hypersensitivity, and altered CNS processing. Other less reproducible mechanisms might include genetic associations, alterations in gastrointestinal microbiota, and disturbances in mucosal and immune function. In most people, diagnosis can be made on the basis of clinical history with limited and judicious use of investigations, unless alarm symptoms such as weight loss or rectal bleeding are present, or there is a family history of inflammatory bowel disease or coeliac disease. Once the diagnosis is made, an empathetic approach is key and can improve quality of life and symptoms, and reduce health-care expenditure. The mainstays of treatment include patient education about the condition, dietary changes, soluble fibre, and antispasmodic drugs. Other treatments tend to be reserved for people with severe symptoms and include central neuromodulators, intestinal secretagogues, drugs acting on opioid or 5-HT receptors, or minimally absorbed antibiotics (all of which are selected according to predominant bowel habit), as well as psychological therapies. Increased understanding of the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome in the past 10 years has led to a healthy pipeline of novel drugs in development."

The management of hidradenitis suppurativa is a challenge and usually consists of both medical and surgical approaches, which must often be combined for best outcome. The introduction of biological therapies, specifically TNFα-inhibitors such as adalimumab, has profoundly changed the therapeutic armamentarium of the disease. Areas covered: The PubMed database was searched using combinations of the following keywords: hidradentis suppurativa, biologic therapy, TNF-α inhibitors, adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, certolizumab pegol, golimumab, adverse effects, pharmacodynamics, pharmacology, adverse events, pharmacokinetics, drug interaction. This article reviews and updates the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, adverse effects, drug interactions of on-label and off-label use of TNF-α inhibitors in HS. Expert opinion: Biologic agents, particularly adalimumab, exhibit clinical efficacy in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. Careful patient selection and close monitoring during treatment are mandatory to provide safe and effective use of the TNF-α inhibitor. Familiarity with biologic agents is crucial because these agents could become a consolidated treatment option in the clinician’s therapeutic approaches."

This condition is distinct from acute liver failure and stable progression of cirrhosis in numerous ways, including triggering precipitant factors, systemic inflammation, rapid progression and a potential for recovery. While a clear definition of ACLF has been forwarded from a large European Consortium study, some heterogeneity remains in how patients present and the types of organ failure, depending on whether they are described in Asian or European studies. Active alcoholism, acute alcoholic hepatitis and infections are the most frequent precipitants for ACLF. Underpinning the pathophysiology of ACLF is a state of persistent inflammation and immune dysfunction, collectively driving a systematic inflammatory response syndrome and an increased propensity to sepsis. Prevention and early treatment of organ failure are key in influencing survival. Given increasing organ shortage and more marginal grafts, liver transplantation is a limited resource and emphasises the need for new therapies to improve ACLF outcomes. Recent data indicate that liver transplantation has encouraging outcomes even in patients with advanced ACLF if patients are carefully selected during the permissive window of clinical presentation. ACLF remains a significant challenge in the field of hepatology, with considerable research and resource being channelled to improve upon the definition, prognostication, treatment and unravelling of mechanistic drivers. This Review discusses updates in ACLF definition, prognosis and management."

Surgical interventions are influenced by the results of: a rectal biopsy, transit studies, the presence of megacolon/megarectum on contrast enema, the degree of soiling/incontinence, anorectal manometry findings, and colonic motility evaluation. In this review, we describe the different surgical options available (intestinal diversion, antegrade enemas, sacral nerve stimulation, colonic resections, and Botulinum toxin injection) and provide guidance on how to choose the best procedure for a given patient."
"Considerations for gut microbiota and probiotics in patients with diabetes amidst the covid-19 pandemic: A narrative review","Barengolts E., Smith E.D.","Endocrine Practice","10.4158/EP-2020-0336","26","10","2020","Objective: To review data implicating microbiota influences on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with diabetes. Methods: Primary literature review included topics: ""COVID-19,""""SARS,""""MERS,""""gut microbiota,""""probiotics,""""immune system,""""ACE2,""and ""metformin.""Results: Diabetes was prevalent (~11%) among COVID-19 patients and associated with increased mortality (about 3-fold) compared to patients without diabetes. COVID-19 could be associated with worsening diabetes control and new diabetes diagnosis that could be linked to high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors (coronavirus point of entry into the host) in the endocrine pancreas. A pre-existing gut microbiota imbalance (dysbiosis) could contribute to COVID-19 related complications in patients with diabetes. The COVID-19 virus was found in fecal samples (~55%), persisted for about 5 weeks, and could be associated with diarrhea, suggesting a role for gut dysbiosis. ACE2 expressed on enterocytes and colonocytes could serve as an alternative route for acquiring COVID-19. Experimental models proposed some probiotics, including Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, and L. salivarius, as vectors for delivering or enhancing efficacy of anti-coronavirus vaccines. These Lactobacillus probiotics were also beneficial for diabetes. The potential mechanisms for interconnections between coronavirus, diabetes, and gut microbiota could be related to the immune system, ACE2 pathway, and metformin treatment. There were suggestions but no proof supporting probiotics benefits for COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: The data suggested that the host environment including the gut microbiota could play a role for COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. It is a challenge to the scientific community to investigate the beneficial potential of the gut microbiota for strengthening host defense against coronavirus in patients with diabetes."
"Efficacy and Safety of Plecanatide in Patients with Chronic Idiopathic Constipation: Pooled Analysis of Two Phase 3 Trials Stratified by Concomitant Acid Suppression Use","Moshiree B., Schoenfeld P.S., Patel R., Lorenzen S., Rezaie A.","American Journal of Gastroenterology","10.14309/01.ajg.0000704072.62120.06","115","SUPPL","2020","INTRODUCTION: Plecanatide, an approved treatment for chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC), replicates the pH-sensitive activity of uroguanylin in binding to guanylate cyclase-C receptors on intestinal epithelium. Since many individuals with CIC experience reflux and use concomitant acid suppression therapy, we explored the impact of concomitant acid suppressor use on the efficacy and safety of plecanatide in adults with CIC. METHODS: Data on two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trials of plecanatide were pooled and results were stratified by concomitant acid suppressor use. For each group, durable overall complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) response rates, changes from baseline in bowel movement frequency, stool consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale), and daily CIC symptom scores (Likert Scale, 0 5 none to 4 5 very severe) were assessed. Safety was analyzed in patients who received ≥1 dose. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat population (n = 2639) included 12.6% of patients with concomitant acid suppressor use. Patients using acid suppressors were 54.8 years (mean), vs 43.9 years in those not using acid suppressors. Gastroesophageal reflux disease was more common in patients using acid suppressors (83.1%), compared to those not on acid suppressors (6.1%). Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were used by 86.4% of patients using acid suppressors with omeprazole as the most common PPI (45.1%); H(2) blockers were used by 17.8% of subjects with ranitidine as the most common H(2) blocker (9.8%). Regardless of acid suppressor use, plecanatide-treated patients demonstrated significant improvements in the durable overall CSBM responder rates (Figure 1) and greater efficacy across almost all reported endpoints (Table 1) vs placebo, with benefits observed as early as Week 1. Comparisons between acid suppressor use groups (yes vs no) were not significantly different for plecanatide-treated patients (both doses, Table 1). Of the plecanatide-treated patients on acid suppressors, 6.4% experienced diarrhea, 1.4% discontinued due to diarrhea, and 2.3% had $ 1 serious adverse event (SAE), compared to 5.0% (diarrhea), 2.1% (discontinued due to diarrhea), and 1.0% (SAE) of patients not using acid suppressors. CONCLUSION: Plecanatide is a safe and effective treatment for CIC when administered with acid suppression therapy. Regardless of acid suppressor use, efficacy responses in plecanatide groups were significantly greater than placebo."

CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 46-year-old female with a medical history of psoriatic arthritis was admitted with a two-week history of progressive right upper-quadrant pain, frequent nonbloody diarrhea, tenesmus, and non-bloody emesis. Her immunosuppressant therapy included certolizumab for the past five years and leflunomide for the past 17 months. She denied use of other medications. Initial laboratory evaluation was significant for a mild leukocytosis, lipase of 476 U/L (normal: 12-61 U/L) and C-reactive protein of 50.8 mg/L (normal #8.0 mg/L). A stool pathogen panel including Clostridioides difficile was negative. RUQ ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. Computed-tomography imaging with contrast revealed no evidence of pancreatitis and mild wall thickening with mucosal hyperenhancement, consistent with ileocolitis (Figure A). A subsequent colonoscopy was notable for circumferential, contiguous inflammation throughout the colon but a normal terminal ileum. Sigmoidal inflammation was mild with a decreased vascular pattern, erythema, and mild friability (Figure B). Biopsy of the descending colon (Figure C) demonstrated surface erosion, crypt abscess (arrowhead) and destruction, and increased lamina propria inflammation without the chronic inflammation classically seen in inflammatory bowel disease. Cytomegalovirus immunostaining was negative. Symptoms persisted despite a three-day course of high-dose intravenous steroids. The decision was made to stop leflunomide, the disease-modifying anti-rheumatologic drug, due to select case reports documenting rare leflunomide-induced colitis. Symptoms improved within two weeks of drug cessation, with a reduction of stool frequency to two formed bowel movements daily, resolution of abdominal pain, and improvement of erythema on repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy. DISCUSSION: This case demonstrates the value of a comprehensive medication history and the diagnostic challenge of leflunomide-induced colitis. Patients with rheumatologic diseases are often on medications with adverse gastrointestinal effects, including biologics, steroids, NSAIDs and other immunomodulators. The lack of randomized studies, vague radiologic, endoscopic and histologic findings, as well as the variable onset after medication initiation makes leflunomide-induced colitis a challenging and rare diagnosis.

Immune-mediated colitis (IMC) is a serious immune-related adverse event, which can make diagnosis and management of this entity challenging in patients with pre-existing Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). We present the case of a 63-year-old woman with pre-existing UC who developed IMC as a result of dual immunotherapy and was successfully treated with Vedolizumab. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 63-year-old woman with a 40-year history of left-sided ulcerative colitis (UC), in clinical and endoscopic remission on 250 mg azathioprine (AZA) and sulfasalazine 4 g daily, was referred to our center after she was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma. AZA was discontinued before starting immunotherapy with Ipilimumab and Nivolumab. After 4 cycles of treatment she presented with symptoms of diffuse abdominal cramping, bleeding per rectum and increased bowel frequency. Initial work up revealed CRP 2.5 mg/dL, and stool studies were negative for any bacterial infection. Colonoscopy demonstrated moderate inflammation, Mayo Clinic Endoscopic Score 2 (MCS), extending continuously from the rectum proximally to 35cm from the anal verge, with gradual transition to normal healthy mucosa in the proximal colon. Pathology showed cryptitis and crypt abscesses with focal ulceration in the recto-sigmoid colon. Initial trial of oral prednisone failed to achieve induction. She then received three induction doses of Vedolizumab intravenously (IV) at weeks 0,2, and 4. She was successfully tapered off steroids and achieved clinical and endoscopic remission after 7 months of maintenance therapy with Vedolizumab every eight weeks. Follow-up colonoscopy demonstrated mildly active pan-ulcerative colitis (MCS 1). Subsequently, she was able to resume treatment with Nivolumab monotherapy without any issues. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, there is scarce data on the management of pre-existing IBD in patients with IMC. It is important to raise awareness on the aftermath of discontinuing IBD therapy for patients who are anticipating immunotherapy. Switching to therapies with a better safety profile and no systemic immunosuppression, like anti-integrins, might be a possible option both prior to and during immunotherapy. More robust data in the form of randomized clinical trials will be needed to further elucidate the use of Vedolizumab as first-line therapy for IMC in patients with underlying IBD."

Therefore, it may have a good application potential. Here, we outline a protocol for the systematic review of this health-care intervention, with the aim to evaluate the beneficial effects and safety of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for patients who suffer from HIV/AIDS-associated diarrhea. Randomized controlled trials that compare Chinese herbs with placebo or other effective treatments will be searched and included, in spite of publication status or language. The primary outcomes include diarrhea frequency and fecal character. The databases we will search as follows: China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (SinoMed), Wanfang Data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed and the CENTRAL in Cochrane Library. Two authors will respectively conduct the screening of trials, data extraction, and use the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the methodological quality. We will analyze the data and perform a meta-analysis if possible. We intend to identify potential therapeutic modalities that may be of benefit to inform clinical practice by supplying existing evidence of the helpful effects and safety of TCM to treat patients suffering from HIV/AIDS-associated diarrhea."

Multiple studies have found that there is a risk that reprocessed patient-ready gastroscopes remain contaminated even when following reprocessing guidelines, which increases the risk of patients acquiring an endoscope-associated infection. Aims & Methods: This study aimed to estimate the contamination rate of reusable patient-ready gastroscopes. A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed and Embase to identify studies, in which gastroscopes have been cultured for microbiological growth after reprocessing. The publication date for the studies was from January 2010 to May 6, 2020. Only full-text papers on randomized controlled trials and observational studies were included. Publication languages included English and the Scandinavian languages. Both thesaurus and free-text searches were performed. Only studies with a sample size of 10 samples or more were included to estimate the contamination rate. The outcome of the random effects model was a pooled contamination rate of patient-ready reusable gastroscopes based on each included study. Inconsistency index (I2) statistics were used to analyze inter-study heterogeneity and publication bias was assessed using Egger's regression test and funnel plots. Results: In the systematic literature review, 2,071 studies were found via PubMed and 1,624 studies via Embase. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the search was narrowed down to 45 studies which were reviewed in full detail. Five studies met the inclusion criteria and the total sample size included 524 samples from gastroscopes, of which 97 were contaminated. Studies were excluded if they did not state the total number of samples from the gastroscopes and the number of which that were contaminated. Included studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Taiwan, and China. The pooled contamination rate was 22.31% +/-0.061 (95% CI: 0.1021-0.3340). I2 was 66.54% which was considered moderate heterogeneity. Egger's regression test was significant for publication bias (p< 0.01). Conclusion: The contamination rate of patient-ready reusable gastroscopes was estimated to be 22.31% based on currently available literature. Significant publication bias and a small sample size should be considered. More high-quality studies should be performed to investigate the true contamination rate of reprocessed gastroscope more thoroughly and to assess the infection risk associated with contaminated gastroscopes."

"Fermented foods, the gut and mental health: a mechanistic overview with implications for depression and anxiety","Aslam H., Green J., Jacka F.N., Collier F., Berk M., Pasco J., Dawson S.L.","Nutritional Neuroscience","10.1080/1028415X.2018.1544332","23","9","2020","Mental disorders including depression and anxiety are often comorbid with gut problems, suggesting a bidirectional relationship between mental health and gut function. Several mechanisms might explain this comorbidity, such as inflammation and immune activation; intestinal permeability; perturbations in the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis; neurotransmitter/neuropeptide dysregulation; dietary deficiencies; and disturbed gut microbiome composition. The potential of modulating the microbiome–gut–brain axis, and subsequently mental health, through the use of functional foods, is an emerging and novel topic of interest. Fermented foods are considered functional foods due to their putative health benefits. The process of microbial fermentation converts food substrates into more nutritionally and functionally rich products, resulting in functional microorganisms (probiotics), substrates that enhance proliferation of beneficial bacteria in the gut (prebiotics), and bioactive components (biogenics). These functional ingredients act biologically in the gastrointestinal tract and have the ability to modify the gut microbiota, influence translocation of endotoxins and subsequent immune activation, and promote host nutrition. This narrative review explores the theoretical potential of the functional components present in fermented foods to alter gut physiology and to impact the biological mechanisms thought to underpin depression and anxiety. Pre-clinical studies indicate the benefits of fermented foods in relieving perturbed gut function and for animal models of depression and anxiety. However, in humans, the literature relating to the relevance of fermented food for treating or preventing depression and anxiety is sparse, heterogeneous and has significant limitations. This review identifies a critical research gap for further evaluation of fermented foods in the management of depression anxiety in humans."

It is known that oral antibiotics manipulate the gut microbiota; however, the impact on host metabolism of obese adults without bacterial infection has not been systematically summarized. Methods: We searched for randomized, placebo-controlled trials that investigated the effects of oral antibiotics on the metabolic status in obese adults via Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Primary outcomes were homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), body weight, and rate of diarrhea. Additional outcomes included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), waist circumference, fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels, and all adverse events. We assessed the certainty of evidence based on Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations. Results: Among 1,762 articles screened, four studies were eligible for quantitative analysis, two of which were applied to meta-analysis. Oral antibiotics had low influence on HOMA-IR [mean difference (MD) 0.09 (95% CI: -0.96 to 1.13)], body weight [MD 4.1 kg (95% CI: -23.77 to 31.97)], FPG [MD -0.12 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.47 to 0.23)], and GLP-1 [MD 0.20 pmol/L (95% CI: -2.36 to 2.76)] compared to placebo. Antibiotics treatment altered fecal acetate and butyrate levels, but resulted in little difference in propionate levels [MD -13.60 µmol/g (95% CI: -22.43 to -4.77), MD -7.60 µmol/g (-10.97 to -4.23), MD -1.10 µmol/g (95% CI: -4.18 to 1.98), respectively]. Several adverse events, such as sun sensitivity and gastrointestinal discomfort, were reported following antibiotics treatment, but no diarrhea. The certainty of evidence for most outcomes was very low to low, except for fecal SCFAs. Conclusions: Our results indicate that oral antibiotics treatment is insufficient to ameliorate metabolic parameters in obese adults, suggesting that oral antibiotics treatment may not qualify as a therapeutic approach for obesity."
"Pathways in the Pathophysiology of Coronavirus 19 Lung Disease Accessible to Prevention and Treatment","Eisenhut M., Shin J.I.","Frontiers in Physiology","10.3389/fphys.2020.00872","11",NA,"2020","Background: In COVID 19 related lung disease, which is a leading cause of death from this disease, cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) may be pivotal in the pathogenesis. TNF alpha reduces fluid absorption due to impairment of sodium and chloride transport required for building an osmotic gradient across epithelial cells, which in the airways maintains airway surface liquid helping to keep airways open and enabling bacterial clearance and aids water absorption from the alveolar spaces. TNF alpha can, through Rho-kinase, disintegrate the endothelial and epithelial cytoskeleton, and thus break up intercellular tight junctional proteins, breaching the intercellular barrier, which prevents flooding of the interstitial and alveolar spaces with fluid. Hypotheses: (1) Preservation and restoration of airway and alveolar epithelial sodium and chloride transport and the cytoskeleton dependent integrity of the cell barriers within the lung can prevent and treat COVID 19 lung disease. (2) TNF alpha is the key mediator of pulmonary edema in COVID 19 lung disease. Confirmation of hypothesis and implications: The role of a reduction in the function of epithelial sodium and chloride transport could with regards to chloride transport be tested by analysis of chloride levels in exhaled breath condensate and levels correlated with TNF alpha concentrations. Reduced levels would indicate a reduction of the function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel and a correlation with TNF alpha levels indicative of its involvement. Anti-TNF alpha treatment with antibodies is already available and needs to be tested in randomized controlled trials of COVID 19 lung disease. TNF alpha levels could also be reduced by statins, aspirin, and curcumin. Chloride transport could be facilitated by CFTR activators, including curcumin and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Sodium and chloride transport could be further regulated to prevent accumulation of alveolar fluid by use of Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(−) cotransporter type 1 inhibitors, which have been associated with improved outcome in adults ventilated for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in randomized controlled trials. Primary prevention of coronavirus infection and TNF alpha release in response to it could be improved by induction of antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and human beta defensin-2 and reduction of TNF alpha production by vitamin D prophylaxis for the population as a whole."
"Use of powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) by healthcare workers for preventing highly infectious viral diseases - A systematic review of evidence","Licina A., Silvers A., Stuart R.L.","Systematic Reviews","10.1186/s13643-020-01431-5","9","1","2020","Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at particular risk during pandemics and epidemics of highly virulent diseases with significant morbidity and case fatality rate. These diseases include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Ebola. With the current (SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic, it is critical to delineate appropriate contextual respiratory protection for HCWs. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) as part of respiratory protection versus another device (egN95/FFP2) on HCW infection rates and contamination. Methods: Our primary outcomes included HCW infection rates with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, Ebola, or MERS when utilizing PAPR. We included randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and observational studies. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL). Two reviewers independently screened all citations, full-text articles, and abstracted data. Due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we did not conduct a meta-analysis. Where applicable, we constructed evidence profile (EP) tables for each individual outcome. Confidence in cumulative evidence for each outcome was classified according to the GRADE system. Results: We identified 689 studies during literature searches. We included 10 full-text studies. A narrative synthesis was provided. Two on-field studies reported no difference in the rates of healthcare workers performing airway procedures during the care of critical patients with SARS-CoV-2. A single simulation trial reported a lower level of cross-contamination of participants using PAPR compared to alternative respiratory protection. There is moderate quality evidence that PAPR use is associated with greater heat tolerance but lower scores for mobility and communication ability. We identified a trend towards greater self-reported wearer comfort with PAPR technology in low-quality observational simulation studies. Conclusion: Field observational studies do not indicate a difference in healthcare worker infection utilizing PAPR devices versus other compliant respiratory equipment. Greater heat tolerance accompanied by lower scores of mobility and audibility in PAPR was identified. Further pragmatic studies are needed in order to delineate actual effectiveness and provider satisfaction with PAPR technology. Systematic review registration: The protocol for this review was prospectively registered with the International Register of Systematic Reviews identification number CRD42020184724."
"Interventions for preventing postpartum constipation","Turawa E.B., Musekiwa A., Rohwer A.C.","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","10.1002/14651858.CD011625.pub3","2020","8","2020","Background: Postpartum constipation, with symptoms, such as pain or discomfort, straining, and hard stool, is a common condition affecting mothers. Haemorrhoids, pain at the episiotomy site, effects of pregnancy hormones, and haematinics used in pregnancy can increase the risk of postpartum constipation. Eating a high-fibre diet and increasing fluid intake are usually encouraged. Although laxatives are commonly used in relieving constipation, the effectiveness and safety of available interventions for preventing postpartum constipation should be ascertained. This is an update of a review first published in 2015. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of interventions for preventing postpartum constipation. Search methods: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, and two trials registers ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (7 October 2019), and screened reference lists of retrieved trials. Selection criteria: We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any intervention for preventing postpartum constipation versus another intervention, placebo, or no intervention in postpartum women. Interventions could include pharmacological (e.g. laxatives) and non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. acupuncture, educational and behavioural interventions). Quasi-randomised trials and cluster-RCTs were eligible for inclusion; none were identified. Trials using a cross-over design were not eligible. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened the results of the search to select potentially relevant trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and the certainty of the evidence, using the GRADE approach. We did not pool results in a meta-analysis, but reported them per study. Main results: We included five trials (1208 postpartum mothers); three RCTs and two quasi-RCTs. Four trials compared a laxative with placebo; one compared a laxative plus a bulking agent versus the same laxative alone, in women who underwent surgical repair of third degree perineal tears. Trials were poorly reported, and four of the five trials were published over 40 years ago. We judged the risk of bias to be unclear for most domains. Overall, we found a high risk of selection and attrition bias. Laxative versus placebo. We included four trials in this comparison. Two of the trials examined the effects of laxatives that are no longer used; one has been found to have carcinogenic properties (Danthron), and the other is not recommended for lactating women (Bisoxatin acetate); therefore, we did not include their results in our main findings. None of the trials included in this comparison assessed our primary outcomes: pain or straining on defecation, incidence of postpartum constipation, or quality of life; or many of our secondary outcomes. A laxative (senna) may increase the number of women having their first bowel movement within 24 hours after delivery (risk ratio (RR) 2.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.24 to 3.75; 1 trial, 471 women; low-certainty evidence); may have little or no effect on the number of women having their first bowel movement on day one after delivery (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.22; 1 trial, 471 women; very low-certainty evidence); may reduce the number of women having their first bowel movement on day two (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.45; 1 trial, 471 women; low-certainty evidence); and day three (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.89; 1 trial, 471 women; low-certainty evidence); and may have little or no effect on the number of women having their first bowel movement on day four after delivery (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.87; 1 trial, 471 women; very low-certainty evidence), but some of the evidence is very uncertain. Adverse effects were poorly reported. Low-certainty evidence suggests that the laxative (senna) may increase the number of women experiencing abdominal cramps (RR 4.23, 95% CI 1.75 to 10.19; 1 trial, 471 women). Very low-certainty evidence suggests that laxatives taken by the mother may have little or no effect on loose stools in the baby (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.41; 1 trial, 281 babies); or diarrhoea (RR 2.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 26.82; 1 trial, 281 babies). Laxative plus bulking agent versus laxative only. Very low-certainty evidence from one trial (147 women) suggests no evidence of a difference between these two groups of women who underwent surgical repair of third degree perineal tears; only median and range data were reported. The trial also reported no evidence of a difference in the incidence of postpartum constipation (data not reported), but did not report on quality of life. Time to first bowel movement was reported as a median (range); very low-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference between the two groups. A laxative plus bulking agent may increase the number of women having any episode of faecal incontinence during the first 10 days postpartum (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.23; 1 trial, 147 women; very low-certainty evidence). The trial did not report on adverse effects of the intervention on babies, or many of our secondary outcomes. Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to make general conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of laxatives for preventing postpartum constipation. The evidence in this review was assessed as low to very low-certainty evidence, with downgrading decisions based on limitations in study design, indirectness and imprecision. We did not identify any trials assessing educational or behavioural interventions. We identified four trials that examined laxatives versus placebo, and one that examined laxatives versus laxatives plus stool bulking agents. Further, rigorous trials are needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of laxatives during the postpartum period for preventing constipation. Trials should assess educational and behavioural interventions, and positions that enhance defecation. They should report on the primary outcomes from this review: pain or straining on defecation, incidence of postpartum constipation, quality of life, time to first bowel movement after delivery, and adverse effects caused by the intervention, such as: nausea or vomiting, pain, and flatus."

Methods: International databanks (ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar) were searched from January 2007 to December 2017 using the following keywords: ‘colorectal cancer’ and ‘probiotics’. The search was restricted to original articles published in English. Reference lists of all related studies were also reviewed to find other relevant publications. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 18.0 (IBM, NY, USA). Also, p < .05 was regarded as statistically significant. Results: A total of 21 clinical trials were retrieved, involving 1831 patients subjected to elective colorectal surgery. The studies included in this review have investigated the effects of probiotics on different aspects of colorectal cancer treatment (p < .05). According to the present study results, probiotics could significantly decrease inflammatory factors, chemotherapy side effects, severe diarrhea, postoperative infectious complications, and duration of antibiotic therapy; shift fecal microbiota in favor of Actinobacteria; and change the tumor tissue microbiota (p < .05). Conclusion: Based on the present review, the preoperative use of pro-/synbiotics as prophylaxis for patients with CRC could improve clinical outcomes. More detailed data about the types of probiotic species and the optimal consumption dose of pro-/synbiotics should be taken in to account in future meta-analysis reviews."
"Effect of Sex, Use of Pantoprazole and Polymorphisms in SLC22A1, ABCB1, CES1, CYP3A5 and CYP2D6 on the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Dabigatran","Zubiaur P., Saiz-Rodríguez M., Ochoa D., Navares-Gómez M., Mejía G., Román M., Koller D., Soria-Chacartegui P., Almenara S., Abad-Santos F.","Advances in Therapy","10.1007/s12325-020-01414-x","37","8","2020","Introduction: Dabigatran is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) used for the treatment of several thrombotic conditions. To date, very few pharmacogenetic studies on dabigatran were published. We aimed to investigate the influence of 59 polymorphisms in 15 genes (including CES1, UGT and CYP that encode enzymes and ABCB1 and SLC that encode transporters), concomitant treatment with pantoprazole and demographic characteristics (including sex or race) on dabigatran pharmacokinetics and safety. Methods: This was a candidate gene pharmacogenetic study. The study population comprised 107 volunteers enrolled in two dabigatran bioequivalence clinical trials; they were genotyped with a ThermoFisher QuantStudio 12K Flex OpenArray instrument. SPSS software v.21 was used for statistical analysis. Results: Women showed a higher exposure to dabigatran compared to men. The concomitant treatment with pantoprazole was associated with a decreased exposure to the drug. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs) were related to lower clearance (Cl/F) (p = 0.049) and a tendency was observed towards higher area under the curve (AUC), maximum concentration (C(max)) and to lower volume of distribution (V(d)/F) (p < 0.10). SLC22A1 haplotype was related to pharmacokinetic variability (p < 0.05). The remaining genes (including CYP, UGT1A1 and ABCB1) had no effect on dabigatran pharmacokinetics (p > 0.10). Women showed more adverse drug reactions (ADR) compared to men (0.40 ± 0.68 vs 0.15 ± 0.41 ADR per person, p = 0.03) and SLC22A1 mutant haplotype was related to a lower risk of nausea (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Sex, concomitant use of pantoprazole and SLC22A1, CYP2D6 and CYP3A5 polymorphism had an effect on dabigatran pharmacokinetics and safety. Previously published pharmacogenetic predictors, namely CES1 or ABCB1 polymorphisms, had no effect on pharmacokinetics and safety. This study is of interest as it increases the scarce pharmacogenetic information on dabigatran."

Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted among 494 children under 5 years of age in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This study was nested within the randomised controlled trial of the Cholera Hospital-Based Intervention for 7 Days (CHoBI7) mobile health (mHealth) program. The CHoBI7 mHealth program focuses on promoting handwashing with soap and water treatment to diarrhoea patients and their household members through mobile messages and a single in person visit. Mouthing and handling of faeces and fomites among young children was measured by five-hour structured observation and caregiver reports. Diarrhoea surveillance data was collected monthly for 12 months. Results: Fifty five percent of caregivers reported that their child put a visibly dirty fomite (object or soil) in their mouth in the past week. Caregivers reported that 50% of children had mouthed visibly dirty objects, 26% had mouthed dirt, and 2% had mouthed faeces. Forty five percent of children were observed mouthing a visibly dirty fomite during structured observation, 40% of children were observed mouthing a visibly dirty object, 10% were observed mouthing soil, and one child (0.2%) was observed mouthing faeces. Mouthing of visibly dirty fomites was highest for children 12-18 months of age with 69% of these children having caregiver reports and 54% having observed events. Children with caregiver reports of mouthing faeces had a significantly higher odds of diarrhoea over the subsequent month (Odds Ratio: 4.54; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.06, 19.48). Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that mouthing of contaminated fomites among young children is frequent in urban environments in Bangladesh, and that mouthing faeces is associated with a significantly higher odds of diarrhoea. Interventions are urgently needed to protect young children from faecal pathogens in their play spaces."

They are common, often distressing, and in some cases debilitating, and significantly add to the health care burden. They present with multiple, overlapping symptoms that can often obscure the underlying pathology and can pose significant diagnostic and management dilemmas. A meticulous history and comprehensive digital rectal examination can provide clarity on the diagnosis, appropriate testing, and management of these conditions. Today, with the development of sophisticated diagnostic tools such as high-resolution and high-definition (3-D) anorectal manometry, 3-D anal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance defecography and imaging, and neurophysiological tests such as translumbosacral anorectal magnetic stimulation, it is possible to more accurately define and characterize the underlying structural and functional abnormalities. In this review, we present a succinct update on the latest knowledge with regards to the pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of anal fissure, hemorrhoids, rectal prolapse, intussusception, rectocele, solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, levator ani syndrome, dyssynergic defecation and fecal incontinence."

Purpose: To conduct a narrative review that summarizes data on the efficacy and safety of two common probiotic strains–Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis BB-12 (BB-12)–when administered to children. Methods: Our search of the PubMed database identified 13 meta-analyses, three systematic reviews, and 15 randomized, controlled trials that assessed BB-12 and LGG, either alone or in combination, when administered to infants to improve growth or to children of any age to prevent or treat acute gastroenteritis (AGE), antibiotic- or healthcare-associated diarrhea (AAD and HAD, respectively), respiratory infections, otitis media, and functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Results: Our review found evidence that LGG can prevent AAD and improve the symptoms of AGE, particularly among children in Europe. However, we found only moderate evidence regarding the benefits of LGG for treating respiratory infections and IBS in children and minimal evidence to support the use of BB-12. While no serious safety concerns were identified, LGG was associated with two non-serious safety concerns of wheezing and viral skin infections. Conclusions: We propose that LGG can be safely administered to toddlers and older children to manage the symptoms of AGE and prevent AAD. These findings should be considered for incorporation into clinical practice guidelines and should help to focus the efforts of the probiotic industry."
"Potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia in people with chronic kidney disease","Natale P., Palmer S.C., Ruospo M., Saglimbene V.M., Strippoli G.F.M.","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","10.1002/14651858.CD013165.pub2","2020","6","2020","Background: Hyperkalaemia is a common electrolyte abnormality caused by reduced renal potassium excretion in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Potassium binders, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate and calcium polystyrene sulfonate, are widely used but may lead to constipation and other adverse gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, reducing their tolerability. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer ion exchange resins for treatment of hyperkalaemia which may cause fewer GI side-effects. Although more recent studies are focusing on clinically-relevant endpoints such as cardiac complications or death, the evidence on safety is still limited. Given the recent expansion in the available treatment options, it is appropriate to review the evidence of effectiveness and tolerability of all potassium exchange resins among people with CKD, with the aim to provide guidance to consumers, practitioners, and policy-makers. Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of potassium binders for treating chronic hyperkalaemia among adults and children with CKD. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 10 March 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled studies (quasi-RCTs) evaluating potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia administered in adults and children with CKD. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed risks of bias and extracted data. Treatment estimates were summarised by random effects meta-analysis and expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence interval (CI). Evidence certainty was assessed using GRADE processes. Main results: Fifteen studies, randomising 1849 adult participants were eligible for inclusion. Twelve studies involved participants with CKD (stages 1 to 5) not requiring dialysis and three studies were among participants treated with haemodialysis. Potassium binders included calcium polystyrene sulfonate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, patiromer, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. A range of routes, doses, and timing of drug administration were used. Study duration varied from 12 hours to 52 weeks (median 4 weeks). Three were cross-over studies. The mean study age ranged from 53.1 years to 73 years. No studies evaluated treatment in children. Some studies had methodological domains that were at high or unclear risks of bias, leading to low certainty in the results. Studies were not designed to measure treatment effects on cardiac arrhythmias or major GI symptoms. Ten studies (1367 randomised participants) compared a potassium binder to placebo. The certainty of the evidence was low for all outcomes. We categorised treatments in newer agents (patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) and older agents (calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate). Patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate may make little or no difference to death (any cause) (4 studies, 688 participants: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.11, 4.32; I(2) = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. The treatment effect of older potassium binders on death (any cause) was unknown. One cardiovascular death was reported with potassium binder in one study, showing that there was no difference between patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo for cardiovascular death in CKD and HD. There was no evidence of a difference between patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at the end of treatment (one study) in CKD or HD. Potassium binders had uncertain effects on nausea (3 studies, 229 participants: RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.65, 6.78; I(2) = 0%; low certainty evidence), diarrhoea (5 studies, 720 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.47, 1.48; I(2) = 0%; low certainty evidence), and vomiting (2 studies, 122 participants: RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.35 to 8.51; I(2) = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. Potassium binders may lower serum potassium levels (at the end of treatment) (3 studies, 277 participants: MD -0.62 mEq/L, 95% CI -0.97, -0.27; I(2) = 92%; low certainty evidence) in CKD and HD. Potassium binders had uncertain effects on constipation (4 studies, 425 participants: RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.71, 3.52; I(2) = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. Potassium binders may decrease systolic blood pressure (BP) (2 studies, 369 participants: MD -3.73 mmHg, 95%CI -6.64 to -0.83; I(2) = 79%; low certainty evidence) and diastolic BP (one study) at the end of the treatment. No study reported outcome data for cardiac arrhythmias or major GI events. Calcium polystyrene sulfonate may make little or no difference to serum potassium levels at end of treatment, compared to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (2 studies, 117 participants: MD 0.38 mEq/L, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.79; I(2) = 42%, low certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in systolic BP (one study), diastolic BP (one study), or constipation (one study) between calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate. There was no difference between high-dose and low-dose patiromer for death (sudden death) (one study), stroke (one study), myocardial infarction (one study), or constipation (one study). The comparative effects whether potassium binders were administered with or without food, laxatives, or sorbitol, were very uncertain with insufficient data to perform meta-analysis. Authors' conclusions: Evidence supporting clinical decision-making for different potassium binders to treat chronic hyperkalaemia in adults with CKD is of low certainty; no studies were identified in children. Available studies have not been designed to measure treatment effects on clinical outcomes such as cardiac arrhythmias or major GI symptoms. This review suggests the need for a large, adequately powered study of potassium binders versus placebo that assesses clinical outcomes of relevance to patients, clinicians and policy-makers. This data could be used to assess cost-effectiveness, given the lack of definitive studies and the clinical importance of potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia in people with CKD."
"Current and future treatments in the fight against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","Smeuninx B., Boslem E., Febbraio M.A.","Cancers","10.3390/cancers12071714","12","7","2020","Obesity is recognised as a risk factor for many types of cancers, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A critical factor in the development of HCC from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Therapies aimed at NASH to reduce the risk of HCC are sparse and largely unsuccessful. Lifestyle modifications such as diet and regular exercise have poor adherence. Moreover, current pharmacological treatments such as pioglitazone and vitamin E have limited effects on fibrosis, a key risk factor in HCC progression. As NAFLD is becoming more prevalent in developed countries due to rising rates of obesity, a need for directed treatment is imperative. Numerous novel therapies including PPAR agonists, anti-fibrotic therapies and agents targeting inflammation, oxidative stress and the gut-liver axis are currently in development, with the aim of targeting key processes in the progression of NASH and HCC. Here, we critically evaluate literature on the aetiology of NAFLD-related HCC, and explore the potential treatment options for NASH and HCC."

For these chronic conditions, the results from clinical trials have been mixed. Further, specifically in obesity and metabolic diseases, there are limited available data, with only a few published studies with a small number of participants and short duration of follow-up. Therefore, this review aims to explore the human, microbial and formulation factors that may affect the success of GMT. This includes various aspects in the preparation and administration of GMT, such as stool processing, modes of delivery, pretreatment with antibiotics and/or bowel lavage, frequency of GMT and possible use of precision bacteriotherapy. In addition, we examine the potential use of GMT in obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic diseases based on current available literature, highlighting some recent advances in GMT research in this area, as well as potential adverse effects after GMT therapy."

In absence of any effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), remdesivir has been tried for a compassionate use in severe COVID-19. Newer randomized controlled studies that have recently become available, showed a mixed result. We aimed to systematically search the literature to understand the pharmacology and clinical effects of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed, ClinicalTrial.Org and MedRxiv database up till May 5, 2020 using specific key words such as “Remdesivir” or ‘GS-5734″ AND “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” and retrieved all the article published in English language, that have reported the pharmacology and the clinical outcomes of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. Results: Initial compassionate use of remdesivir has shown a fairly good result, but difficult to quantify, in the absence of control arm. While the very first double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial conducted in Wuhan, did not find any significant benefit compared to the control, the preliminary result of another similar multi-country trial has shown a significant faster time to recovery but without any difference in mortality. Conclusions: Remdesivir has shown a mixed result in patients with COVID-19 with an acceptable side effect. However, jury is still out while awaiting the results from the forthcoming trials."
"Renal impairment, C. difficile recurrence, and the differential effect of bezlotoxumab: A post hoc analysis of pooled data from 2 randomized clinical trials","Golan Y., DuPont H.L., Aldomiro F., Jensen E.H., Hanson M.E., Dorr M.B.","Open Forum Infectious Diseases","10.1093/ofid/ofaa248","7","7","2020","Background. Renal impairment is not a consistently cited risk factor for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI). We examined the association between renal impairment and rCDI and the effect of bezlotoxumab, an anti-toxin B monoclonal antibody, in reducing rCDI in participants with renal impairment. Methods. We pooled data from 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trials conducted in participants receiving bezlotoxumab or placebo infusion during oral antibacterial drug treatment for CDI. We assessed the association between renal impairment and rCDI in placebo-treated participants and evaluated the effect of bezlotoxumab vs placebo in reducing rCDI among participants with renal impairment, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <90 mL/min. Results. The proportion of placebo-treated participants experiencing rCDI within 12 weeks was higher in those with renal impairment (n = 919) vs those without renal impairment (n = 612; 36.6% and 27.7%, respectively; difference, 8.9%; 95% CI, 1.3% to 16.3%). Renal impairment was significantly associated with a higher rate of recurrence in placebo-treated participants lacking commonly recognized risk factors for rCDI (renal impairment as only risk factor, 28.8%; vs normal renal function and no risk factors, 12.5%; difference, 16.3%; 95% CI, 3.4% to 28.8%). Among all participants with renal impairment, the rate of rCDI was 19.5% among bezlotoxumab-treated vs 36.6% among placebo-treated participants (difference, -17.1%; 95% CI, -23.4% to -10.6%). Conclusions. This post hoc analysis adds to the literature suggesting an association of renal impairment as an independent risk factor for rCDI and provides preliminary evidence that patients with renal impairment who suffer with CDI may benefit from adjunctive treatment with bezlotoxumab."
"Skin preparation for preventing infection following caesarean section","Hadiati D.R., Hakimi M., Nurdiati D.S., Masuzawa Y., da Silva Lopes K., Ota E.","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","10.1002/14651858.CD007462.pub5","2020","6","2020","Background: The risk of maternal mortality and morbidity is higher after caesarean section than for vaginal birth. With increasing rates of caesarean section, it is important to minimise risks to the mother as much as possible. This review focused on different skin preparations to prevent infection. This is an update of a review last published in 2018. Objectives: To compare the effects of different antiseptic agents, different methods of application, or different forms of antiseptic used for preoperative skin preparation for preventing postcaesarean infection. Search methods: For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (9 July 2019), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials, evaluating any type of preoperative skin preparation (agents, methods or forms). We included studies presented only as abstracts, if there was enough information to assess risk of bias. Comparisons of interest in this review were between: different antiseptic agents (e.g. alcohol, povidone iodine), different methods of antiseptic application (e.g. scrub, paint, drape), different forms of antiseptic (e.g. powder, liquid), and also between different packages of skin preparation including a mix of agents and methods, such as a plastic incisional drape, which may or may not be impregnated with antiseptic agents. We mainly focused on the comparison between different agents, with and without the use of drapes. Only studies involving the preparation of the incision area were included. This review did not cover studies of preoperative handwashing by the surgical team or preoperative bathing. Data collection and analysis: Three review authors independently assessed all potential studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, extracted the data and checked data for accuracy. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included 13 individually-randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with a total of 6938 women who were undergoing caesarean section. Twelve trials (6916 women) contributed data to this review. The trial dates ranged from 1983 to 2016. Six trials were conducted in the USA, and the remainder in India, Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa, France, Denmark, and Indonesia. The included studies were broadly at low risk of bias for most domains, although high risk of detection bias raised some specific concerns in a number of studies. Length of stay was only reported in one comparison. Antiseptic agents. Parachlorometaxylenol with iodine versus iodine alone. We are uncertain whether parachlorometaxylenol with iodine made any difference to the incidence of surgical site infection (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 2.99; 1 trial, 50 women), or endometritis (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.38; 1 trial, 50 women) when compared with iodine alone, because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Adverse events (maternal or neonatal) were not reported. Chlorhexidine gluconate versus povidone iodine. Moderate-certainty evidence suggested that chlorhexidine gluconate, when compared with povidone iodine, probably slightly reduces the incidence of surgical site infection (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.91; 8 trials, 4323 women). This effect was still present in a sensitivity analysis after removing four trials at high risk of bias for outcome assessment (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.23; 4 trials, 2037 women). Low-certainty evidence indicated that chlorhexidine gluconate, when compared with povidone iodine, may make little or no difference to the incidence of endometritis (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.86; 3 trials, 2484 women). It is uncertain whether chlorhexidine gluconate reduces maternal skin irritation or allergic skin reaction (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.46; 3 trials, 1926 women; very low certainty evidence). One small study (60 women) reported reduced bacterial growth at 18 hours after caesarean section for women who had chlorhexidine gluconate preparation compared with women who had povidone iodine preparation (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.70). Methods. Drape versus no drape. This comparison investigated the use of drape versus no drape, following preparation of the skin with antiseptics. Low-certainty evidence suggested that using a drape before surgery compared with no drape, may make little or no difference to the incidence of surgical site infection (RR 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.71; 3 trials, 1373 women), and probably makes little or no difference to the length of stay in the hospital (mean difference (MD) 0.10 days, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.46; 1 trial, 603 women; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial compared an alcohol scrub and iodophor drape with a five-minute iodophor scrub only, and reported no surgical site infection in either group (79 women, very-low certainty evidence). We were uncertain whether the combination of a one-minute alcohol scrub and a drape reduced the incidence of metritis when compared with a five-minute scrub, because the certainty of the evidence was very low (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.29 to 9.16; 1 trial, 79 women). The studies did not report on adverse events (maternal or neonatal). Authors' conclusions: Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that preparing the skin with chlorhexidine gluconate before caesarean section is probably slightly more effective at reducing the incidence of surgical site infection in comparison to povidone iodine. For other outcomes examined there was insufficient evidence available from the included RCTs. Most of the evidence in this review was deemed to be very low or low certainty. This means that for most findings, our confidence in any evidence of an intervention effect is limited, and indicates the need for more high-quality research. Therefore, it is not yet clear what sort of skin preparation may be most effective for preventing postcaesarean surgical site infection, or for reducing other undesirable outcomes for mother and baby. Well-designed RCTs, with larger sample sizes are needed. High-priority questions include comparing types of antiseptic (especially iodine versus chlorhexidine), and application methods (scrubbing, swabbing, or draping). We found two studies that are ongoing; we will incorporate the results of these studies in future updates of this review."
"Effect of household water treatment with chlorine on diarrhea among children under the age of five years in rural areas of Dire Dawa, eastern Ethiopia: A cluster randomized controlled trial","Solomon E.T., Robele S., Kloos H., Mengistie B.","Infectious Diseases of Poverty","10.1186/s40249-020-00680-9","9","1","2020","Background: Diarrheal disease is a leading cause of child mortality and morbidity worldwide. Household water treatment with chlorine significantly reduces morbidity due to waterborne diseases. However, the effect of point-of-use (POU) water treatment in improving the quality of water in areas where POU is not provided free of charge and the effectiveness of home visits in inspiring household members to use POU regularly have not been studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of drinking water disinfection by chlorination on diarrheal disease reduction among children under the age of 5 years in rural eastern Ethiopia. Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was carried out in rural Dire Dawa from October 2018 through January 2019. The 405 households were randomized to intervention and control arms and intervention materials were distributed after conducting a baseline survey. This trial evaluated the effectiveness of household drinking water disinfection by chlorination in reducing incidence of diarrhea among children under the age of 5 years. Intervention households received 1.2% sodium hypochlorite with demonstration of its proper use. Participants in the control households continued with their usual habits of water collection and water storage. Generalized estimation equation (GEE) with log link Poisson distribution family and exchangeable correlation matrix was used to compute crude incidence rate ratio (IRR), adjusted IRR and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Results: In the intervention households, in total, 281 cases of diarrhea were documented (8.7 cases per 100 person-weeks observation); in the control households, in total 446 cases of diarrhea were documented (13.8 cases per 100 person-weeks observation). A 36.0% (adjusted IRR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.57-0.73) reduction in incidence of diarrhea was observed in the intervention arm when compared with the control arm. The highest and the lowest reductions were obtained in children of age ranges 1 to 2 years and 3 to 4 years, 42.7 and 30.4%, respectively. Adherence to the intervention was 81.3% as measured by free residual chlorine test. Conclusions: In rural areas where diarrhea is the second leading cause of morbidity, water chlorination at the household level using liquid bleach considerably reduced episodes of diarrhea among children under the age of 5 years. Therefore, chlorinating drinking water at the household level may be a valuable interim solution for reducing the incidence of diarrheal diseases until potable water is made accessible to the majority of the population in Dire Dawa Administration and other Ethiopian communities."

Around 50% will experience pouchitis, an idiopathic inflammatory condition involving the ileal reservoir, responsible for digestive symptoms, deterioration in quality of life, and disability. Though the majority of initial cases of pouchitis are easily managed with a short course of antibiotics, in about 10% of cases, inflammation of the pouch becomes chronic with very few treatments available. Previous studies have suggested that manipulating the composition of intestinal flora through antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics achieved significant results for treating acute episodes of UC-associated pouchitis. However, there is currently no established effective treatment for chronic antibiotic-dependent pouchitis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a novel therapy involving the transfer of normal intestinal flora from a healthy donor to a patient with a medical condition potentially caused by the disrupted homeostasis of intestinal microbiota or dysbiosis. Methods: Our project aims to compare the delay of relapse of chronic recurrent pouchitis after FMT versus sham transplantation. Forty-two patients with active recurrent pouchitis after having undergone an IPAA for UC will be enrolled at 12 French centers. The patients who respond to antibiotherapy will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to receive either FMT or sham transplantation. Discussion: On April 30, 2014, the World Health Organization published an alarming report on antibiotic resistance. Finding an alternative medical treatment to antibiotics in order to prevent relapses of pouchitis is therefore becoming increasingly important given the risk posed by multiresistant bacteria. Moreover, if the results of this study are conclusive, FMT, which is less expensive than biologics, could become a routine treatment in the future.

"Emerging therapies in primary sclerosing cholangitis: pathophysiological basis and clinical opportunities","Vesterhus M., Karlsen T.H.","Journal of Gastroenterology","10.1007/s00535-020-01681-z","55","6","2020","Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a progressive liver disease, histologically characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the bile ducts, and clinically leading to multi-focal biliary strictures and with time cirrhosis and liver failure. Patients bear a significant risk of cholangiocarcinoma and colorectal cancer, and frequently have concomitant inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune disease manifestations. To date, no medical therapy has proven significant impact on clinical outcomes and most patients ultimately need liver transplantation. Several treatment strategies have failed in the past and whilst prescription of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) prevails, controversy regarding benefits remains. Lack of statistical power, slow and variable disease progression, lack of surrogate biomarkers for disease severity and other challenges in trial design serve as critical obstacles in the development of effective therapy. Advances in our understanding of PSC pathogenesis and biliary physiology over recent years has however led to a surge of clinical trials targeting various mechanistic compartments and currently raising hopes for imminent changes in patient management. Here, in light of pathophysiology, we outline and critically evaluate emerging treatment strategies in PSC, as tested in recent or ongoing phase II and III trials, stratified per a triad of targets of nuclear and membrane receptors regulating bile acid metabolism, immune modulators, and effects on the gut microbiome. Furthermore, we revisit the UDCA trials of the past and critically discuss relevant aspects of clinical trial design, including how the choice of endpoints, alkaline phosphatase in particular, may affect the future path to novel, effective PSC therapeutics."

Methodology We analyzed individual participant-level data from 16 studies (13 single-arm or cohort studies and three randomized trials), amounting to 683 preschool-age children (aged <6 years) and 2,010 school-age children (aged 6–14 years). Children had a documented Schistosoma mansoni or S. haematobium infection, were treated with single 40 mg/kg oral praziquantel, and assessed between 21 and 60 days post-treatment. Efficacy was expressed as arithmetic mean and individual egg reduction rate (ERR) and meta-analyzed using general linear models and mixed models. Safety was summarized using reported adverse events (AEs). Principal findings Preschool-age children had significantly lower baseline Schistosoma egg counts and more losses to follow-up compared to school-age children. No difference in efficacy was found between preschool-and school-age children using a general linear model of individual-par-ticipant ERR with baseline log-transformed egg count as covariate and study, age, and sex as fixed variables, and a mixed model with a random effect on the study. Safety was reported in only four studies (n = 1,128 individuals); few AEs were reported in preschool-age children 4 and 24 hours post-treatment as well as at follow-up. Three severe but not serious AEs were recorded in school-age children during follow-up. Conclusions/Significance There is no indication that single 40 mg/kg oral praziquantel would be less efficacious and safe in preschool-age children compared to school-age children, with the caveat that only few randomized comparisons exist between the two age groups. Preventive chemotherapy might therefore be extended to preschool-age children, with proper monitoring of its efficacy and safety."
"Does suboptimal household flooring increase the risk of diarrhoea and intestinal parasite infection in low and middle income endemic settings? A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol","Sartorius B., Legge H., Pullan R.","Systematic Reviews","10.1186/s13643-020-01384-9","9","1","2020","Background: Water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions often fail to show long-term impact on diarrhoeal and/or intestinal parasite risk in many low- A nd middle-income countries. Less attention has been paid to wider contextual factors that may contribute to high levels of contamination in the domestic environment such as household flooring. The purpose of this study will be to assess the association between diarrhoeal and/or intestinal parasite infection status and unimproved/unfinished flooring in low- A nd middle-income countries. Methods: We will conduct a comprehensive search of published studies (randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and observational studies) that examined the association between unimproved/unfinished household flooring and diarrhoeal and/or intestinal parasite infection status from January 1, 1980, onwards with no language restriction. The primary outcome will include diarrhoeal and/or intestinal parasite infection status. Databases to be searched include EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The secondary outcome will be the association between specific pathogens (laboratory confirmed) and unimproved/unfinished household flooring. Independent screening for eligible studies using defined criteria and data extraction will be completed in duplicate and independently. Any discrepancies between the two reviewers will be resolved by consensus and/or arbitration by a third researcher. If data permits, random effects models will be used where appropriate. Subgroup and additional analyses will be conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity (e.g. age group, geographical region) and potential risk of bias of included studies. Discussion: This review will provide a comprehensive examination of a possible association between suboptimal household flooring and increased risk of enteric pathogen infection, highlight gaps for future research in high risk areas, and inform intervention design for future planned studies in Kenya and/or elsewhere in the region.

"A New Approach to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: The Gut Microbiota","Yurtdaş G., Akdevelioğlu Y.","Journal of the American College of Nutrition","10.1080/07315724.2019.1657515","39","4","2020","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a widespread endocrine disease that affects 6% to 20% of women of reproductive age and is associated with high risk of infertility, obesity, and insulin resistance. Although genetic, neuroendocrine, and metabolic causes have been stated to lead to PCOS, the etiology of PCOS remains unclear. Recent studies in humans and rodent models have shown an association between changes in the gut microbiome and the metabolic and clinical parameters of PCOS. In addition, it has been proposed that dysbiosis of gut microbiota may be a potential pathogenetic factor in the development of PCOS. In this context, modification of gut microbiota with probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic agents suggests that these products may serve as new treatment options for PCOS. In this review, it is aimed to explain the relationship between PCOS and gut microbiota with possible mechanisms and to examine the new treatment approaches that can be developed in this direction. Key teaching points Studies have shown that gut microbiota may be a potential pathogenetic factor in the development of PCOS. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota in women with PCOS appears to be associated with PCOS phenotypes. Studies suggest that insulin resistance, sex hormone concentrations, and obesity may affect the diversity and composition of gut microbiota in women with PCOS. With better understanding of the role of intestinal microbiota in PCOS, interventions including prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics can be considered as future treatment options."

We report efficacy results of a randomized phase II trial of HDR monotherapy delivered as either one or two fractions. Materials and methods: Eligible patients had low or intermediate risk prostate cancer, prostate volume <60 cc, and no androgen deprivation use. 170 patients were randomized to receive HDR as either a single fraction of 19 Gy or as two fractions of 13.5 Gy one week apart. Median age was 65 years, median PSA was 6.33 ng/ml, and Grade Group 1, 2 and 3 was present in 28%, 60%, and 12%, respectively. There was no difference in baseline factors between arms and 19%, 51% and 30% had low risk, favourable intermediate and unfavourable intermediate risk disease, respectively. The Phoenix definition was used to define biochemical failure, all local failures were confirmed by biopsy and toxicity was assessed using CTCAE v.4. Results: Median follow-up was 60 months. PSA decreased more quickly in the 2-fraction arm (p = 0.009). Median PSA at 5-years was 0.65 ng/ml in the single fraction and 0.16 ng/ml in the 2-fraction arm. The 5-year biochemical disease-free survival and cumulative incidence of local failure was 73.5% and 29% in the single fraction arm and 95% (p = 0.001) and 3% (p < 0.001) in the 2-fraction arm, respectively. Recurrence was not associated with initial stage, grade group, or risk group. Grade 2 late rectal toxicity occurred in 1% while the incidence of grade 2 and 3 urinary toxicity was 45% and 1%, respectively, with no difference between arms. Conclusions: HDR monotherapy delivered as two fraction of 13.5 Gy is well tolerated with a high cancer control rate at 5 years. Single fraction monotherapy is inferior and should not be used."

Secondary bile acid profiles have been postulated as a potential marker for cirrhosis progression. Modulating gut microbiota dysbiosis using a nonsystemic antibiotic such as rifaximin may beneficially impact the bile acid pool. This post hoc subanalysis evaluated fecal bile acid profiles in patients with early decompensated cirrhosis treated with rifaximin soluble solid dispersion (SSD) tablets, an investigational rifaximin formulation with improved water solubility, while maintaining minimal systemic exposure. Methods: In a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial, adults with cirrhosis and ascites (grade ≥1), with no history of esophageal variceal bleeding or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, received rifaximin SSD or placebo once nightly for 24 weeks (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01904409). This post hoc subanalysis evaluated data from patients receiving rifaximin SSD immediate-release (IR) tablets 40 mg (most efficacious dose) or placebo once daily. Stool samples were collected at screening (Day -21 to Day -7), after 24 weeks of treatment, and at 2 weeks post-treatment (Week 26). Bile acids were extracted from stool and profiles were determined using highperformance liquid chromatography, per published methods (Kakiyama G, et al. J Lipid Res. 2014;55[5]:978-990). Results: Stool samples were analyzed for 48 patients in rifaximin SSD IR 40-mg group and 50 patients in the placebo group. At screening, mean (SD) total fecal bile acid concentrations were 12.2 (18.6) and 8.2 (9.8) µmol/g of stool for rifaximin SSD IR 40 mg and placebo, respectively; 3.8 (10.8) and 1.6 (3.2) µmol/g of stool for primary bile acids; and 7.7 (10.2) and 5.7 (8.4) µmol/g of stool sample for secondary bile acids. A significantly higher mean concentration of total and secondary bile acids were observed in the rifaximin SSD IR 40-mg group versus placebo at Weeks 24 and 26 (Figure): for total bile acids, the difference was 0.6 µmol/g (95% CI, 0.1-1.1; P=0.02), and for secondary bile acids, 0.9 µmol/g (95% CI, 0.0-1.7; P=0.046). Conclusions: Rifaximin SSD IR 40 mg once daily for 24 weeks increased the total and secondary fecal bile acid concentrations versus placebo in patients with early decompensated cirrhosis. This indicates that rifaximin SSD IR treatment has an impact on gut microbial function. Larger trials are warranted on rifaximin SSD IR and the role of fecal bile acid profiles as a marker for disease progression and complications of cirrhosis. Supported by Salix Pharmaceuticals."

The prevalence of constipation-related complaints tends to increase with age. There are limited data regarding safety and efficacy of guanylate cyclase-C receptor agonists in the elderly. This analysis pooled data from plecanatide phase 3 trials in CIC and IBS-C to assess its safety and efficacy in patients aged ≥65 years (yrs). Methods: Populations from 2 CIC and 2 IBS-C trials of patients randomized to plecanatide 3 mg, plecanatide 6 mg, or placebo were combined for post hoc analysis. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were collected and are reported for patients ≥65 yrs and <65 yrs old, using descriptive statistics. The 4 trials shared a number of secondary efficacy endpoints related to constipation that allowed the CIC and IBS-C trial populations to be combined: changes in stool consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale [BSFS]), changes in the weekly frequency of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) and spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs), and time from start of therapy to first CSBM and first SBM. Results: The pooled safety population comprised 468 patients aged ≥65 yrs (mean: 70.0 yrs) and 4505 patients aged <65 yrs (mean: 42.0 yrs), of whom 302 and 3017, respectively, were randomized to plecanatide. The most common TEAE was diarrhea (Table 1), with rates in the pooled plecanatide dose groups similar in the older and younger cohorts. No cases of serious diarrhea were reported. Rates of discontinuation and diarrhea-related discontinuation in the plecanatide groups were low in both the older and younger cohorts. No new safety signals were observed. Efficacy data for patients aged ≥65 yrs were consistent with those in the full study populations and patients aged <65 yrs (Table 2). There were statistically significant improvements in stool consistency from baseline with plecanatide 3 and 6 mg versus placebo at Week 12, both in patients aged ≥65 yrs and in those aged <65 yrs. Changes from baseline in mean weekly CSBM frequency and mean weekly SBM frequency at Week 12 were numerically greater in the plecanatide groups, compared with placebo; differences were statistically significant versus placebo in the plecanatide 3 mg group in patients aged ≥65 yrs and in both plecanatide groups in patients aged <65 yrs. Furthermore, the times from the start of therapy to first CSBM and first SBM were significantly shorter in the plecanatide groups than in the placebo group in patients aged <65 yrs (P< 0.001 for both) and in patients aged ≥65 yrs. Discussion: Results, which include a meaningful number of elderly patients, indicate that plecanatide is a well-tolerated and effective treatment option for patients aged ≥65 yrs with CIC and IBS-C."
"ACID SUPPRESSION THERAPY DOES NOT AFFECT THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY PROFILE OF PLECANATIDE: A PATIENT-LEVEL POOLED ANALYSIS OF TWO LARGE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS IN CHRONIC IDIOPATHIC CONSTIPATION","Moshiree B., Schoenfeld P., Patel R., Rezaie A.","Gastroenterology","10.1016/S0016-5085(20)31678-4","158","6","2020","Introduction: Plecanatide replicates the pH-sensitive activity of uroguanylin in binding to guanylate cyclase-C receptors expressed on intestinal epithelium. This binding leads to chloride first, then water secretion into the intestinal lumen, followed by movement of stool through the colon. Since plecanatide works through a pH-dependent mechanism, this post hoc analysis was performed to explore the impact of concomitant acid suppressor use on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of plecanatide 3 or 6 mg in adults with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). Methods: Efficacy and safety data from two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trials of plecanatide were pooled. Patients were stratified by concomitant acid suppressor use. The following measures were assessed: changes from baseline at 12 weeks in complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM), spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) frequency, stool consistency as measured by the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), and daily CIC symptom scores, which were measured on a 5-point Likert Scale (0=none to 4=very severe). Standard safety evaluations were conducted in both studies. Results: Of the total pooled population, 12.6% (n=339/2683) received concomitant acid suppression medication (plecanatide 3 mg, n=107/896; plecanatide 6 mg, n=113/890; placebo, n=119/897). Most patients on acid suppression medication had gastroesophageal reflux disease (83.2%, n=282), compared with 6% (n=141) of those not on acid suppression medication. Among patients using acid suppression medications, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were used by 86.3% of plecanatide patients and 85.8% of placebo patients; H(2) blockers were also used similarly (18.1% plecanatide vs 17.5% placebo). Efficacy results from patients using acid suppressors were consistent with those in patients not using acid suppressors. Plecanatide treatment demonstrated statistically significantly greater efficacy compared with placebo across efficacy endpoints (p<0.001), including more regular and well-formed bowel movements, improvement in straining, bloating, and abdominal pain, and improved patient-reported constipation symptoms irrespective of concomitant acid suppressor use (Table 1). The treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) profile showed no new safety signals among patients using acid suppression medication. The most common TEAE was diarrhea, which was experienced in 6.2% of patients using acid suppressors and 4.6% of those who did not in the plecanatide-treated group. Patients discontinued plecanatide treatment due to diarrhea in 1.3% of the acid suppression group and 2% of the non–acid suppression group. Discussion: Plecanatide has shown to be efficacious and safe in patients taking acid suppression medication and can be administered with concomitant acid suppression medication without impacting efficacy or safety."
"Personal protective equipment for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff","Verbeek J.H., Rajamaki B., Ijaz S., Sauni R., Toomey E., Blackwood B., Tikka C., Ruotsalainen J.H., Kilinc Balci F.S.","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","10.1002/14651858.CD011621.pub4","2020","4","2020","Background: In epidemics of highly infectious diseases, such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or coronavirus (COVID-19), healthcare workers (HCW) are at much greater risk of infection than the general population, due to their contact with patients' contaminated body fluids. Personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk by covering exposed body parts. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is the best way to put PPE on (i.e. donning) or to remove PPE (i.e. doffing), and how to train HCWs to use PPE as instructed. Objectives: To evaluate which type of full-body PPE and which method of donning or doffing PPE have the least risk of contamination or infection for HCW, and which training methods increase compliance with PPE protocols. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL to 20 March 2020. Selection criteria: We included all controlled studies that evaluated the effect of full-body PPE used by HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases, on the risk of infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. We also included studies that compared the effect of various ways of donning or doffing PPE, and the effects of training on the same outcomes. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in included trials. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses were appropriate. Main results: Earlier versions of this review were published in 2016 and 2019. In this update, we included 24 studies with 2278 participants, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCT), one was a quasi-RCT and nine had a non-randomised design. Eight studies compared types of PPE. Six studies evaluated adapted PPE. Eight studies compared donning and doffing processes and three studies evaluated types of training. Eighteen studies used simulated exposure with fluorescent markers or harmless microbes. In simulation studies, median contamination rates were 25% for the intervention and 67% for the control groups. Evidence for all outcomes is of very low certainty unless otherwise stated because it is based on one or two studies, the indirectness of the evidence in simulation studies and because of risk of bias. Types of PPE. The use of a powered, air-purifying respirator with coverall may protect against the risk of contamination better than a N95 mask and gown (risk ratio (RR) 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.43) but was more difficult to don (non-compliance: RR 7.5, 95% CI 1.81 to 31.1). In one RCT (59 participants), people with a long gown had less contamination than those with a coverall, and coveralls were more difficult to doff (low-certainty evidence). Gowns may protect better against contamination than aprons (small patches: mean difference (MD) −10.28, 95% CI −14.77 to −5.79). PPE made of more breathable material may lead to a similar number of spots on the trunk (MD 1.60, 95% CI −0.15 to 3.35) compared to more water-repellent material but may have greater user satisfaction (MD −0.46, 95% CI −0.84 to −0.08, scale of 1 to 5). Modified PPE versus standard PPE. The following modifications to PPE design may lead to less contamination compared to standard PPE: sealed gown and glove combination (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), a better fitting gown around the neck, wrists and hands (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55), a better cover of the gown-wrist interface (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78, low-certainty evidence), added tabs to grab to facilitate doffing of masks (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31). Donning and doffing. Using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for doffing may lead to less contamination compared to no guidance (small patches: MD −5.44, 95% CI −7.43 to −3.45). One-step removal of gloves and gown may lead to less bacterial contamination (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.77) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28) than separate removal. Double-gloving may lead to less viral or bacterial contamination compared to single gloving (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28). Additional spoken instruction may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD −0.9, 95% CI −1.4 to −0.4) and to fewer contamination spots (MD −5, 95% CI −8.08 to −1.92). Extra sanitation of gloves before doffing with quaternary ammonium or bleach may decrease contamination, but not alcohol-based hand rub. Training. The use of additional computer simulation may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD −1.2, 95% CI −1.6 to −0.7). A video lecture on donning PPE may lead to better skills scores (MD 30.70, 95% CI 20.14 to 41.26) than a traditional lecture. Face-to-face instruction may reduce noncompliance with doffing guidance more (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) than providing folders or videos only. Authors' conclusions: We found low- to very low-certainty evidence that covering more parts of the body leads to better protection but usually comes at the cost of more difficult donning or doffing and less user comfort, and may therefore even lead to more contamination. More breathable types of PPE may lead to similar contamination but may have greater user satisfaction. Modifications to PPE design, such as tabs to grab, may decrease the risk of contamination. For donning and doffing procedures, following CDC doffing guidance, a one-step glove and gown removal, double-gloving, spoken instructions during doffing, and using glove disinfection may reduce contamination and increase compliance. Face-to-face training in PPE use may reduce errors more than folder-based training. We still need RCTs of training with long-term follow-up. We need simulation studies with more participants to find out which combinations of PPE and which doffing procedure protects best. Consensus on simulation of exposure and assessment of outcome is urgently needed. We also need more real-life evidence. Therefore, the use of PPE of HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases should be registered and the HCW should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection."

Water and sanitation improvement, health education, and drug treatment may help break the cycle of transmission, and effective drugs will reduce morbidity. Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety of anthelmintic drugs (albendazole, mebendazole, ivermectin) for treating people with Ascaris infection. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, three other databases, and reference lists of included studies, without language restrictions, up to 4 July 2019. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCT) that compared albendazole, mebendazole, and ivermectin in children and adults with confirmed Ascaris infection. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from the included trials. A third review author checked the quality of data extraction. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool to determine the risk of bias in included trials. We used risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare dichotomous outcomes in treatment and control groups. We used the fixed-effect model for studies with low heterogeneity and the random-effects model for studies with moderate to high heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used the control rate average to provide illustrative cure rates in the comparison groups. Main results: We included 30 parallel-group RCTs, which enrolled 6442 participants from 17 countries across Africa, Asia, Central America and the Caribbean, and South America. Participants were from 28 days to 82 years of age, recruited from school, communities, and health facilities. Twenty studies were funded or co-funded by manufacturers, while 10 studies were independent of manufacturer funding. Twenty-two trials had a high risk of bias for one or two domains (blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting). Single dose of albendazole (four trials), mebendazole (three trials) or ivermectin (one trial) was compared to placebo. Parasitological cure at 14 to 60 days was high in all the studies (illustrative cure of 93.0% in the anthelmintic group and 16.1% in the placebo group; RR 6.29, 95% CI 3.91 to 10.12; 8 trials, 1578 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Single dose of albendazole is as effective as multiple doses of albendazole (illustrative cure of 93.2% with single dose, 94.3% with multiple doses; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.05; 3 trials, 307 participants; high-certainty evidence); or as single dose of mebendazole (illustrative cure of 98.0% with albendazole, 96.9% with mebendazole; RR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.02; 6 trials, 2131 participants; high-certainty evidence). Studies did not detect a difference between a single dose of albendazole and a single dose of ivermectin (cure rates of 87.8% with albendazole, 90.2% with ivermectin; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.08; 3 trials, 519 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Across all the studies, failure after single dose of albendazole ranged from 0.0% to 30.3%, mebendazole from 0.0% to 22.2%, and ivermectin from 0.0% to 21.6%. The egg reduction rate (ERR) measured up to 60 days after the treatment was high in all treated groups, regardless of the anthelmintic used (range 96% to 100%). It was not possible to evaluate parasitological cure by classes of infection intensity. No included trials reported complication or serious adverse events. Other adverse events were apparently similar among the compared anthelmintic groups (moderate- to low-certainty evidence). The most commonly reported other adverse events were nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, headache, and fever. Authors' conclusions: Single-dose of albendazole, mebendazole, and ivermectin all appeared effective against Ascaris lumbricoides infection, yielding high parasitological cure and large reductions in eggs excreted, with no differences detected between them. The drugs appear to be safe to treat children and adults with confirmed Ascaris infection. There is little to choose between drugs and regimens in terms of cure or adverse events."
"Is coverage of S. aureus necessary in cellulitis/erysipelas? A literature review","Karakonstantis S.","Infection","10.1007/s15010-019-01382-7","48","2","2020","Background: Empirical treatment of patients with cellulitis/erysipelas usually targets both streptococci and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). However, the recommendation to empirically cover MSSA is weak and based on low-quality evidence. Methods and objective: A systematic review was conducted in PubMed and clinical trial registries to assess the role of S. aureus in cellulitis/erysipelas and the need for empirical MSSA coverage. Results: Combined microbiological and serological data, and response to penicillin monotherapy suggest that streptococci are responsible for the vast majority of cases of cellulitis/erysipelas. However, most cases are non-culturable and the specificity of microbiological and serological studies is questionable based on recent studies using molecular techniques. According to epidemiological data and three randomized controlled trials, empirical coverage of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is not recommended for most patients, despite the high prevalence of MRSA in many areas. If MRSA is indeed not an important cause of uncomplicated cellulitis/erysipelas, then the same may apply to MSSA. Based on indirect comparison of data from clinical studies, cure rates with penicillin monotherapy (to which most MSSA are resistant) are comparable to the cure rates reported in many studies using wider-spectrum antibiotics. Conclusion: Considering the limitations of microbiological studies in identifying the pathogens responsible for cellulitis/erysipelas, treatment needs to be guided by clinical trials. Trials comparing penicillin or amoxicillin monotherapy to MSSA-covering regimens are needed to definitively answer whether empirical coverage of MSSA is needed and to identify the subset of patients that can be safely treated with penicillin or amoxicillin monotherapy."

For this reason, a prompt diagnosis is fundamental to early treatment and the prevention of transmission. The aim of this article is to review diagnostic laboratory methods that are now available to detect C. difficile and to discuss the most recent recommendations on CDI treatment in children. Currently, there is no consensus on the best method for detecting C. difficile. Indeed, none of the available diagnostics possess at the same time high sensitivity and specificity, lowcost and rapid turnaround times. Appropriate therapy is targeted according to age, severity and recurrence of the episode of infection, and the recent availability of new antibiotics opens new opportunities. De-escalation of antibiotics that are directly associated with CDI remains a priority and the cautious use of probiotics is recommended. Vancomycin represents the first-line therapy for CDI, although in children metronidazole can still be used as a first-line drug. Fidaxomicin is a new treatment option with equivalent initial response rates as vancomycin but lower relapse rates of CDI. Faecal microbiota transplantation should be considered for patients with multiple recurrences of CDI. Monoclonal antibodies and vaccines seem to represent a future perspective against CDI. However, only further studies will permit us to understand whether these new approaches could be effective in therapy and prevention of CDI in paediatric populations."

Although historically the healthy stomach was considered a sterile organ, we now know it is colonised with a complex microbiota. However, its role in health and disease is not well understood. Aim: To systematically explore the literature on the gastric microbiota in health and disease as well as the gut microbiota after bariatric surgery. Methods: A systematic search of online bibliographic databases MEDLINE/EMBASE was performed between 1966 and February 2019 with screening in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Randomised controlled trials, cohort studies and observational studies were included if they reported next-generation sequencing derived microbiota analysis on gastric aspirate/tissue or stool samples (bariatric surgical outcomes). Results: Sixty-five papers were eligible for inclusion. With the exception of H pylori-induced conditions, overarching gastric microbiota signatures of health or disease could not be determined. Gastric carcinogenesis induces a progressively altered microbiota with an enrichment of oral and intestinal taxa as well as significant changes in host gastric mucin expression. Proton pump inhibitors usage increases gastric microbiota richness. Bariatric surgery is associated with an increase in potentially pathogenic proteobacterial species in patient stool samples. Conclusion: While H pylori remains the single most important risk factor for gastric disease, its capacity to shape the collective gastric microbiota remains to be fully elucidated. Further studies are needed to explore the intricate host/microbial and microbial/microbial interplay."

To control the disease, safe and effective vaccines are being used in several countries. We assessed the impact of vaccination on the risk factors for acute rotavirus diarrhea (ARD) in Bangladesh. Methods: We used the data of a cluster-randomized trial. The clusters were 142 villages, 71 in each of the two arms of study. The infants were offered human rotavirus vaccine (HRV), Rotarix, over three-year period. We divided the time period into two equal periods (T1 and T2). A generalized estimating equation with logit-link function was used to evaluate the risk factors by arm and by period. Results: Among 10,917 children, 5,759 (53%) were in the HRV villages. We had 359 cases; 44% in the HRV villages. Mean age of attack was similar between the arms of study in T1, but significantly higher in HRV villages than that in the non-HRV villages in T2. In HRV villages, males were at a higher risk of having ARD than females in T1, but not in T2. In contrast, males were at a higher risk of having ARD in both the time periods in non-HRV villages. In HRV-villages, children having literate mother were at significantly higher risk of having ARD in T1 but not in T2; whereas children in the non-HRV villages had a higher risk of having ARD in T2. Children living in an area with higher phone users had more cases than their counterpart in non-HRV villages, but not in HRV villages. Conclusion: Our study illustrates that several risk factors for ARD varied between the two arms of study as well as between the two periods of study. Assessing post-vaccination risk factors is, therefore, important for understanding the impact of vaccination and undertaking post-vaccination control measures."

Frequent recurrences have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, high healthcare costs, and lower quality of life. In this review, we compare the efficacy of interventions designed to prevent rCDI. We performed a systematic review of the English literature, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated rCDI as an outcome. Studies were included irrespective of patient demographics, disease severity, type of intervention, comparator used, or time-point of outcome evaluation. We performed a comprehensive literature search with the assistance of a research librarian. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Our search yielded 38 RCTs (8,102 participants). Nineteen RCTs (3,743 subjects) evaluated antibiotics, eight fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) (582 subjects), three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (2,805 subjects), and eight probiotics, prebiotics, or non-antibiotic polymers (972 subjects). The antibiotic and FMT therapies that demonstrated efficacy in rCDI prevention included: fidaxomicin (when compared to a ten-day vancomycin course) and FMT administered by nasogastric tube (when compared to a fourteen-day vancomycin course and a fourteen-day vancomycin course plus bowel lavage). Actoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin A; CDA1) plus bezlotoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin B; CDB1) in combination or bezlotoxumab alone appeared to be more effective in preventing rCDI compared to actoxumab alone. Of the prebiotics, probiotics, and nonantibiotic polymers, oligofructose, Saccharomyces boulardii, and the nontoxigenic C. difficile strain M3 were the most efficacious for rCDI prevention. Thirty-eight RCTs (>8,000 participants) evaluating treatment modalities for CDI were examined for efficacy in prevention of rCDI. Several CDI-specific antibiotics, FMT modalities, monoclonal antibodies, and various prebiotics and probiotics demonstrated a reduction in risk of rCDI with the greatest risk reduction observed with FMT and monoclonal antibody therapy. It is notable that the comparators in these studies were very different from one another and the relative risk reduction of rCDI may not be directly comparable from one study to the next."

A UTI is defined as complicated when urinary tract anatomical abnormalities or urinary devices are present, when it is recurrent and when associated with immunodeficiency. Complicated UTIs (cUTIs) have a higher risk of treatment failure and often require longer antimicrobial treatment courses. cUTIs, especially those which are healthcare-associated, are often due to multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs). Areas covered: This article will review the available evidence in relation to prevention of sepsis in cUTI, evaluating the risk factors associated with sepsis development. Published articles from January 2005 to September 2019 on UTIs and sepsis prevention in complicated UTIs were identified by using MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine Bethesda MD) and by reviewing the references of retrieved articles. Expert opinion: Prevention of sepsis relies on prompt and timely diagnosis of cUTI, early identification of the causative organism, removal of obstructions and source control, proper and adequate empirical/targeted antimicrobial treatment. In particular, source control, i.e. removal of urinary obstructions, infected stents, urinary catheters, nephrostomies, and drainage of hydronephrosis/abscess, is essential for preventing the development and progression of sepsis."

Although there have been important advances in the knowledge of the pathophysiology of PAH, it remains a debilitating, limiting, and rapidly progressive disease. Vitamin D and iron deficiency are worldwide health problems of pandemic proportions. Notably, these nutritional alterations are largely more prevalent in PAH patients than in the general population and there are several pieces of evidence suggesting that they may trigger or aggravate disease progression. There are also several case reports associating scurvy, due to severe vitamin C deficiency, with PAH. Flavonoids such as quercetin, isoflavonoids such as genistein, and other dietary polyphenols including resveratrol slow the progression of the disease in animal models of PAH. Finally, the role of the gut microbiota and its interplay with the diet, host immune system, and energy metabolism is emerging in multiple cardiovascular diseases. The alteration of the gut microbiota has also been reported in animal models of PAH. It is thus possible that in the near future interventions targeting the nutritional status and the gut dysbiosis will improve the outcome of these patients."

OIC differs from other forms of constipation in that it is an iatrogenic condition that occurs when an opioid acts on the dense network of μ-opioid receptors in the enteric system, which affect a variety of functions including gastrointestinal motility, secretion, and other factors that can cause bowel dysfunction. Unfortunately, laxative products, bowel regimens, dietary changes, and lifestyle modifications have limited effectiveness in preventing OIC, Opioid-associated adverse effect which occurs in 40% to 80% of opioid patients and may led to cessation of the treatment. PAMORAs are μ-receptor opioid antagonists specifically developed so that they have very limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and thus they are able to antagonize peripheral but not central μ-opioid receptors. PAMORAs are designed to have no effect on the analgesic benefits of opioid pain relievers but to relieve but antagonizing the effects of the opioid in the gastrointestinal system. The three main PAMORAS are methyl-trexone (oral or parenteral), naldemedine (oral only), and naloxegol (oral only). Clinical studies demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these agents for alleviating constipation without diminishing the analgesic effect of opioid therapy.

Children under the age of two and elderly individuals are at the great-est risk. Knowledge of this condition is important for an early diagnosis to be made and treatment to be initiated. Objective: The review aimed to familiarize physicians with the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of scabies. Methods: A search was conducted using Pubmed with the built-in ""Clinical Queries"" tool. The search term ""Scabies"" was used. The categories of ""epidemiology"", ""diagnosis"", ""therapy"", ""pre-vention"" and ""prognosis"" had a limited scope for primary clinical studies. Meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews were included. Only papers published in the English language were included. A descriptive, narrative synthesis was provided of the retrieved articles. Results: Worldwide, scabies affects 200 to 300 million individuals annually. The average prevalence is estimated to be 5 to 10% in children of developing countries. Transmission usually occurs after close prolonged skin-to-skin contact. Classic scabies is characterized by an erythematous papular eruption, serpiginous burrows, and intense pruritus. Sites of predilection include the webs of the fingers, volar wrists, lateral aspects of fingers, extensor surfaces of elbows and knees, waist, navel, abdomen, buttocks, groins, and, genitals. A clinical diagnosis of classic scabies can be made on the basis of the history and clinical findings. Other clinical variants include crusted scabies, nodular scabies, and bullous scabies. Finding the mite, ova, or fecal pellets on microscopic examination of scrapings taken from skin lesions confirms the diagnosis of scabies infestation. For eradi-cation of scabies mites, the drugs of choice are topical permethrin and oral ivermectin. Conclusion: Scabies is a highly contagious parasitic cutaneous disease that is stigmatising and de-bilitating. Increased awareness, accurate diagnosis, and prompt treatment are essential for the effective control of scabies and for the prevention of the spread of the disease."

While pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a well-defined disease with established guidelines, Eosinophilic Gastritis (EoG), Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis (EoGE) and Eosinophilic Colitis (EoC) remain a clinical enigma with evidence based on limited anecdotal case reports. Large cross-sectional studies in the US defined a prevalence of EoG and EoGE ranging from 1,5 to 6,4/100.000 and from 2,7 to 8,3/100.000 subjects respectively, while the prevalence of EoC ranges from 1,7 to 3,5/100.000 subjects. Regarding the pathogenesis, it is hypothesized that EGIDs result from the interplay between genetic predisposition, intestinal dysbiosis and environmental triggers. Clinically, EGIDs might present with different and nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms depending on the involved intestinal tract and the extension of eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate. The diagnosis of EGIDs requires: 1. recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms, 2. increased eosinophils for high power field in biopsy specimens, 3. absence of secondary causes of gastrointestinal eosinophilia. No validated guidelines are available on the clinical management of patients with EGIDs. Evidence from case reports and small uncontrolled case series suggests the use of dietary and corticosteroids as the first-line treatments. Considering the clinical follow-up of EGIDs, three different patterns of disease course are identified: single flare, recurring course-disease and chronic course-disease. This review will focus on pediatric EGIDs distal to esophagus, including Eosinophilic Gastritis (EoG), Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis (EoGE) and Eosinophilic Colitis (EoC)."

Although its prevalence is reportedly lower in Asia than in Western countries, the rapid increase in the incidence of IBD has drawn attention to its etiology, including genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. Specifically, recent studies concerning dietary treatments and intestinal microbiota suggest that these factors may interact with the immune system, and the imbalance of this relationship may lead to immune dysregulation in IBD. Changes in diet or alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota may be associated with the increasing incidence of IBD in Asia. Here, we aim to review recent studies on the role of diet and intestinal microbiota in IBD pathogenesis and the results of the investigations performed to modulate these factors."

Changes in colonic microflora may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, and improvements in the intestinal microflora may relieve the disease. Fecal bacterial transplants and oral probiotics are becoming important ways to relieve active ulcerative colitis. Purpose This systematic review with meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety of basic treatment combined with fecal microbiota transplantation or mixed probiotics therapy in relieving mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Methods The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane libraries (updated September 2019) were searched to identify randomized, placebo-controlled, or head-to-head trials assessing fecal microbiota transplantation or probiotic VSL#3 as induction therapy in active ulcerative colitis. We analyze data using the R program to obtain evidence of direct comparison and to generate intermediate variables for indirect treatment comparisons. Results Seven randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were used as the sources of the induction data. All treatments were superior to placebo. In terms of clinical remission and clinical response to active ulcerative colitis, direct comparisons showed fecal microbiota transplantation (OR = 3.47, 95% CI = 1.93–6.25) (OR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.18–5.21) and mixed probiotics VSL#3 (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.49–3.88) (OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 1.53–6.25) to have better effects than the placebo. Indirect comparison showed fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotic VSL#3 did not reach statistical significance either in clinical remission (RR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.70–2.06) or clinical response (RR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.62–1.45). In terms of safety, fecal microbiota transplantation (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.51–2.61) and VSL #3 (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.33–2.49) showed no statistically significant increase in adverse events compared with the control group. In terms of serious adverse events, there was no statistical difference between the fecal microbiota transplantation group and the control group (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.46–3.57). The probiotics VSL#3 seems more safer than fecal microbiota transplantation, because serious adverse events were not reported in the VSL#3 articles. Conclusions Fecal microbiota transplantation or mixed probiotics VSL#3 achieved good results in clinical remission and clinical response in active ulcerative colitis, and there was no increased risk of adverse reactions. There was no statistical difference between the therapeutic effect of fecal microbiota transplantation and that of mixed probiotics VSL#3. However, the use of fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics still has many unresolved problems in clinical applications, and more randomized controlled trials are required to confirm its efficacy."
"Formoterol for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","Tashkin D.P.","International Journal of COPD","10.2147/COPD.S273497","15",NA,"2020","Bronchodilators, including long-acting β(2)-agonists and long-acting muscarinic antagonists, are the mainstay for treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to prevent exacerbations or reduce symptoms. Formoterol is a highly selective and potent β(2)-agonist that relaxes airway smooth muscle to significantly improve lung function. Inhaled formoterol works within 5 minutes of administration and provides improvements in spirometry measurements over 12 hours. The lipophilicity of formoterol allows it to form a depot within the smooth muscle to provide a prolonged duration of action. Following therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations are very low or undetectable. Determination of the pharmacokinetics of formoterol following high-dose administration to healthy volunteers revealed that the drug was rapidly absorbed and excreted unchanged in the urine with a half-life of 10 hours. Inhaled formoterol, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents, is an effective and safe treatment option for patients with moderate to severe COPD. Clinical studies have demonstrated improvements in lung function and COPD symptoms, particularly dyspnea; reductions in the risk of exacerbations; and improvement in patients’ health status. The adverse event profile of inhaled formoterol is similar to that of placebo, with few adverse cardiovascular events. Formoterol is a valuable bronchodilator used in the maintenance treatment of COPD. This review describes the mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of inhaled formoterol. It also reviews the results of large, randomized, controlled clinical trials that evaluated the use of formoterol as monotherapy and in combination with inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting muscarinic antagonists, and triple therapy regimens in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe COPD."

This review summarizes the existing data regarding microbiome-based approaches to gastrointestinal pathogen colonization in ICU patients with a focus on prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics."
"High dose PPI-amoxicillin dual therapy for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection: a systematic review with meta-analysis","Zhu Y.-J., Zhang Y., Wang T.-Y., Zhao J.-T., Zhao Z., Zhu J.-R., Lan C.-H.","Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology","10.1177/1756284820937115","13",NA,"2020","Background: Helicobacter pylori resistance to amoxicillin remains rare in many regions. Proton pump inhibitor-amoxicillin-containing high dose dual therapy (HDDT) has been proposed to treat H. pylori infection. We aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of PPI-amoxicillin HDDT for treatment of H. pylori infection in comparison with other regimens. Methods: Databases, including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, were searched to find relevant publications. Randomized controlled trials comparing HDDT with control regimens for H. pylori eradication in adult patients were included. The primary outcome was eradication rate by intention-to-treat analysis. Adverse events were analyzed as second outcome. Results: A total of 15 trials with 3818 patients qualified for inclusion. The eradication rate of HDDT was neither significantly inferior nor superior to the recommended regimens such as triple therapy, bismuth quadruple therapy, and non-bismuth quadruple therapy [relative risk (RR): 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.96–1.05, p = 0.870]. This finding was robust through subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. Trial sequential analysis showed that HDDT was equivalent to control regimens, and further similar trials were unlikely to alter the conclusions of this analysis. The frequency of adverse events was significantly lower in HDDT group (RR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.37–0.64, p < 0.001). Conclusion: HDDT was equivalent to recommended first-line or rescue regimens with fewer adverse effects. The evidence from this meta-analysis supports the use of HDDT as first-line or rescue treatment for H. pylori infection. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD42019133002."
"Selective intestinal decontamination as a method for preventing infectious complications (review)","Barsuk A.L., Nekaeva E.S., Lovtsova L.V., Urakov A.L.","Sovremennye Tehnologii v Medicine","10.17691/stm2020.12.6.10","12","6","2020","Infectious complications are the most common cause of death in patients with severe burns. To date, there is no generally accepted method for preventing such complications in burn injury. One of the possible prevention options is selective intestinal decontamination (SID). This method is based on the enteral administration of non-absorbable antimicrobial agents. The preventive effect of SID involves inhibition of intestinal microflora translocation through the mucous membranes, inasmuch as studies demonstrate that endogenous opportunistic microorganisms are a common cause of infectious complications in various critical conditions. The SID method was originally developed in the Netherlands for patients suffering from mechanical injury. Antimicrobial drugs were selected based on their high activity in relation to the main endogenous opportunistic pathogens and minimal activity against normal intestinal microflora components. The combination of polymyxin (B or E), tobramycin, and amphotericin B with intravenous cefotaxime was chosen as the first SID regimen. Other regimens were proposed afterwards, and the application field of the method was expanded. In particular, it became the method of choice for prevention of infectious complications in patients with severe burn injury. Clinical studies demonstrate efficacy of some SID regimens for preventing infectious complications in patients with thermal injury. Concomitant administration of SID and systemic preventive antibiotics and addition of oropharyngeal decontamination increases the method efficacy. SID is generally well-tolerated, but some studies show an increased risk of diarrhea with this preventive option. In addition, SID increases the risk of developing antibiotic resistance like any other antibiotic regimens."

More than 1.2 billion people have ascariasis worldwide. Objective: This article aimed to provide an update on the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of as-cariasis. Methods: A PubMed search was conducted in February 2020 in Clinical Queries using the key terms “ascariasis” OR “Ascaris lumbricoides”. The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews published within the past 10 years. The search was restricted to English literature. The information retrieved from the above search was used in the compilation of the present article. Patents were searched using the key term “ascariasis” OR “Ascaris lumbricoides” in www.freepatentsonline.com. Results: Ascaris lumbricoides is transmitted through the ingestion of embryonated eggs from fe-cal-contaminated material. Ascariasis has high endemicity in tropical and subtropical areas. Predis-posing factors include poverty, poor sanitation, inadequate sewage disposal, and poor personal hy-giene. The prevalence is greatest in children younger than 5 years of age. The majority of patients with intestinal ascariasis are asymptomatic. For those with symptoms, anorexia, nausea, bloating, abdominal discomfort, recurrent abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and intermittent diarrhea are not uncommon. Other clinical manifestations vary widely, depending on the underlying compli-cations. Complications include Löeffler syndrome, intestinal obstruction, biliary colic, recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, cholecystitis, acalculous cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, and malnutrition. The diagnosis is best established by microscopic examination of fecal smears or following concentration techniques for the characteristic ova. Patients with A. lumbri-coides infection warrant anthelminthic treatment, even if they are asymptomatic, to prevent complications from migration of the parasite. Albendazole and mebendazole are the drugs of choice for children and nonpregnant individuals with ascariasis. Pregnant women with ascariasis should be treated with pyrantel pamoate. Recent patents related to the management of ascariasis are also dis-cussed. Conclusion: The average cure rate with anthelminthic treatment is over 95%. Unfortunately, most treated patients in endemic areas become re-infected within months. Health education, personal hy-giene, improved sanitary conditions, proper disposal of human excreta, and discontinuing the use of human fecal matter as a fertilizer are effective long-term preventive measures. Targeting de-worming treatment and mass anthelminthic treatment should be considered in regions where A. lum-bricoides is prevalent."
"Efficacy and safety of saxagliptin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus","Orime K., Terauchi Y.","Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy","10.1080/14656566.2020.1803280","21","17","2020","Introduction: Saxagliptin, a member of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) class of drugs, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in 2009, and has been in clinical use for more than a decade. Since the drug was first launched, much real-world evidence has also been accumulated. The efficacy and safety of saxagliptin, especially its cardiovascular safety, are of particular interest. Areas covered: This review provides an overview of the safety and efficacy of saxagliptin based on observational studies, pharmacovigilance, and meta-analyses. In addition, with the findings of recent cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs), the authors discuss, herein, the efficacious use of saxagliptin. Expert opinion: Saxagliptin exhibits a moderate glucose-lowering effect and is well tolerated by patients with T2D. SAVOR-TIMI 53, a CVOT of saxagliptin, reported neutral effects of saxagliptin in respect of the cardiovascular outcomes, but did raise a concern about the risk of heart failure. Conversely, recent CVOTs on sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have shown a favorably reduced risk of heart failure with these drugs. Also, DPP-4is decrease the serum glucagon level, whereas the SGLT2is increase it. Given the characteristics of the two classes of drugs, combined therapy with the two might be a promising option."

After screening 74 records, we identified 4 eligible studies. These studies suggest an increased risk of viral transmission with public transportation use that may be reduced with improved ventilation. International and national guidelines suggest the following strategies: keep the public informed, stay at home when sick, and minimise public transport use. Where use is unavoidable, environmental control, respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene are recommended, while a risk-based approach needs to guide the use of non-medical masks."

Berberine has a broad-spectrum antibiotic activity and is very widely used to treat diarrhea in China. No systematic review has been carried out to evaluate the evidence presented in clinical trials. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of berberine in diarrhea treatment among children and adults. Methods: Seven databases and two clinical trial registries were searched on 1 September 2019. Randomized controlled trials were included, where participants were diagnosed (first diagnosed) as having diarrhea according to clear diagnostic criteria. Berberine alone or in combination with Western medication as intervention were included. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on children or adults, acute or persistent diarrhea, infectious or noninfectious and treatment courses. Primary outcomes were clinical cure rate and duration of diarrhea. The GRADE tool was used to assess the quality of evidence. Results: A total of 38 randomized controlled trials were included involving 3948 participants (including 27 trials on 2702 children) were included. Compared with antibiotics, berberine plus antibiotics showed better results in both adults and in children in general, especially when given for 7 days or 3 days in acute infectious diarrhea of children. Compared with the control groups, using berberine alone or in combination with montmorillonite, probiotics, and vitamin B increased the clinical cure rate of diarrhea. The use of berberine alone or berberine combined with montmorillonite reduced the duration of hospitalization. Using berberine had significantly better laboratory indicators (isoenzyme, inflammatory factors, myocardial enzyme, and fecal trait) and fewer systemic symptoms than the no berberine groups. Overall, 22 of 27 trials on children used berberine as an enema. No deaths and serious adverse events were reported. The quality of evidence of included trials was moderate to low or very low. The impact of different dosages, frequencies and treatment durations on the outcomes was not evaluated due to insufficient number of trials. Conclusion: This review demonstrated that berberine was generally effective in improving clinical cure rates and shortening the duration of diarrhea compared with control groups. No severe adverse event was reported. However, there is still a lack of high-quality evidence for evaluating the efficacy and safety of berberine.

Here we show that a lack of bifidobacteria, and in particular depletion of genes required for human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) utilization from the metagenome, is associated with systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation early in life. In breastfed infants given Bifidobacterium infantis EVC001, which expresses all HMO-utilization genes, intestinal T helper 2 (Th2) and Th17 cytokines were silenced and interferon beta (IFNbeta) was induced.

DESIGN: Eighty-two healthy overweight and obese subjects with a habitually low intake of fruit and vegetables and a sedentary lifestyle participated in a parallel 8-week randomised controlled trial. Forty-three participants consumed an MD tailored to their habitual energy intakes (MedD), and 39 maintained their regular diets (ConD). Dietary adherence, metabolic parameters, gut microbiome and systemic metabolome were monitored over the study period. RESULTS: Increased MD adherence in the MedD group successfully reprogrammed subjects' intake of fibre and animal proteins. Compliance was confirmed by lowered levels of carnitine in plasma and urine. Significant reductions in plasma cholesterol (primary outcome) and faecal bile acids occurred in the MedD compared with the ConD group. Shotgun metagenomics showed gut microbiome changes that reflected individual MD adherence and increase in gene richness in participants who reduced systemic inflammation over the intervention. The MD intervention led to increased levels of the fibre-degrading Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and of genes for microbial carbohydrate degradation linked to butyrate metabolism. The dietary changes in the MedD group led to increased urinary urolithins, faecal bile acid degradation and insulin sensitivity that co-varied with specific microbial taxa. CONCLUSION: Switching subjects to an MD while maintaining their energy intake reduced their blood cholesterol and caused multiple changes in their microbiome and metabolome that are relevant in future strategies for the improvement of metabolic health."

The hormone melatonin has antioxidant properties and might contribute to alleviating chronic conditions by reducing oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of exogenous melatonin on periodontitis in an animal model of the disease as well as in patients with periodontitis. METHODS: In rats with ligature-induced periodontitis, melatonin was administered in drinking water for two weeks. In the human study, patients with treatment-resistant periodontitis were asked to rinse their mouths with a solution containing melatonin or placebo every evening for two weeks. Periodontal status as well as salivary markers of oxidative stress were assessed at the end of the study. RESULTS: Neither radiography nor muCT revealed any significant effects of melatonin on alveolar bone loss. Gum recession was the only improved macroscopic measure in rats (p < 0.05). Analysis of salivary markers of oxidative stress revealed no effects of treatment in rats or humans despite clearly elevated melatonin concentrations in melatonin treated groups. CONCLUSION: Our results do not support the use of melatonin for the treatment of periodontitis. However, the negative outcome is limited by the short duration of the study and the chosen route of application as well as the dose of melatonin."

We previously conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial of FMT in obese metabolically healthy patients in which we found that FMT enhanced gut bacterial bile acid metabolism and delayed the development of impaired glucose tolerance relative to the placebo control group. Therefore, we conducted a secondary analysis of fecal samples collected from these patients to assess the potential gut microbial species contributing to the effect of FMT to improve metabolic health and increase gut bacterial bile acid metabolism. Fecal samples collected at baseline and after 4 weeks of FMT or placebo treatment underwent shotgun metagenomic analysis. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to profile fecal bile acids. FMT-enriched bacteria that have been implicated in gut bile acid metabolism included Desulfovibrio fairfieldensis and Clostridium hylemonae. To identify candidate bacteria involved in gut microbial bile acid metabolism, we assessed correlations between bacterial species abundance and bile acid profile, with a focus on bile acid products of gut bacterial metabolism. Bacteroides ovatus and Phocaeicola dorei were positively correlated with unconjugated bile acids. Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Collinsella aerofaciens, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were positively correlated with secondary bile acids. Together, these data identify several candidate bacteria that may contribute to the metabolic benefits of FMT and gut bacterial bile acid metabolism that requires further functional validation."

We studied the effects of a low-fat, high-fiber diet (LFD) vs an improved standard American diet (iSAD, included higher quantities of fruits, vegetables, and fiber than a typical SAD). We collected data on quality of life, markers of inflammation, and fecal markers of intestinal dysbiosis in patients with UC. METHODS: We analyzed data from a parallel-group, cross-over study of 17 patients with UC in remission or with mild disease (with a flare within the past 18 mo), from February 25, 2015, through September 11, 2018. Participants were assigned randomly to 2 groups and received a LFD (10% of calories from fat) or an iSAD (35%-40% of calories from fat) for the first 4-week period, followed by a 2-week washout period, and then switched to the other diet for 4 weeks. All diets were catered and delivered to patients' homes, and each participant served as her or his own control. Serum and stool samples were collected at baseline and week 4 of each diet and analyzed for markers of inflammation. We performed 16s ribosomal RNA sequencing and untargeted and targeted metabolomic analyses on stool samples. The primary outcome was quality of life, which was measured by the short inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) questionnaire at baseline and week 4 of the diets. Secondary outcomes included changes in the Short-Form 36 health survey, partial Mayo score, markers of inflammation, microbiome and metabolome analysis, and adherence to the diet. RESULTS: Participants' baseline diets were unhealthier than either study diet. All patients remained in remission throughout the study period. Compared with baseline, the iSAD and LFD each increased quality of life, based on the short IBD questionnaire and Short-Form 36 health survey scores (baseline short IBD questionnaire score, 4.98; iSAD, 5.55; LFD, 5.77; baseline vs iSAD, P = .02; baseline vs LFD, P = .001). Serum amyloid A decreased significantly from 7.99 mg/L at baseline to 4.50 mg/L after LFD (P = .02), but did not decrease significantly compared with iSAD (7.20 mg/L; iSAD vs LFD, P = .07). The serum level of C-reactive protein decreased numerically from 3.23 mg/L at baseline to 2.51 mg/L after LFD (P = .07). The relative abundance of Actinobacteria in fecal samples decreased from 13.69% at baseline to 7.82% after LFD (P = .017), whereas the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes increased from 14.6% at baseline to 24.02% on LFD (P = .015). The relative abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was higher after 4 weeks on the LFD (7.20%) compared with iSAD (5.37%; P = .04). Fecal levels of acetate (an anti-inflammatory metabolite) increased from a relative abundance of 40.37 at baseline to 42.52 on the iSAD and 53.98 on the LFD (baseline vs LFD, P = .05; iSAD vs LFD, P = .09). The fecal level of tryptophan decreased from a relative abundance of 1.33 at baseline to 1.08 on the iSAD (P = .43), but increased to a relative abundance of 2.27 on the LFD (baseline vs LFD, P = .04; iSAD vs LFD, P = .08); fecal levels of lauric acid decreased after LFD (baseline, 203.4; iSAD, 381.4; LFD, 29.91; baseline vs LFD, P = .04; iSAD vs LFD, P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: In a cross-over study of patients with UC in remission, we found that a catered LFD or iSAD were each well tolerated and increased quality of life. However, the LFD decreased markers of inflammation and reduced intestinal dysbiosis in fecal samples. Dietary interventions therefore might benefit patients with UC in remission.

RBX2660 is a live biotherapeutic product consisting of a broad consortium of microbes prepared from human stool that is under investigation for the reduction of recurrent C. difficile infection. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study, with a Bayesian primary analysis integrating data from a previous phase IIb study, was conducted. Adults who had one or more C. difficile infection recurrences with a positive stool assay for C. difficile and who were previously treated with standard-of-care antibiotics were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive a subsequent blinded, single-dose enema of RBX2660 or placebo. The primary endpoint was treatment success, defined as the absence of C. difficile infection diarrhea within 8 weeks of study treatment. RESULTS: Of the 320 patients screened, 289 were randomly assigned and 267 received blinded treatment (n = 180, RBX2660; n = 87, placebo). Original model estimates of treatment success were 70.4% versus 58.1% with RBX2660 and placebo, respectively. However, after aligning the data to improve the exchangeability and interpretability of the Bayesian analysis, the model-estimated treatment success rate was 70.6% with RBX2660 versus 57.5% with placebo, with an estimated treatment effect of 13.1% and a posterior probability of superiority of 0.991. More than 90% of the participants who achieved treatment success at 8 weeks had sustained response through 6 months in both the RBX2660 and the placebo groups. Overall, RBX2660 was well tolerated, with manageable adverse events. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was higher in RBX2660 recipients compared with placebo and was mostly driven by a higher incidence of mild gastrointestinal events. CONCLUSIONS: RBX2660 is a safe and effective treatment to reduce recurrent C. difficile infection following standard-of-care antibiotics with a sustained response through 6 months.

Although the detrimental impact of these compounds on the intestinal microbiota and intestinal health have been demonstrated in animal and in vitro models, impact of these food additives in healthy humans remains poorly characterized. METHODS: To examine this notion in humans, we performed a double-blind controlled-feeding study of the ubiquitous synthetic emulsifier carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) in which healthy adults consumed only emulsifier-free diets (n = 9) or an identical diet enriched with 15 g per day of CMC (n = 7) for 11 days. RESULTS: Relative to control subjects, CMC consumption modestly increased postprandial abdominal discomfort and perturbed gut microbiota composition in a way that reduced its diversity. Moreover, CMC-fed subjects exhibited changes in the fecal metabolome, particularly reductions in short-chain fatty acids and free amino acids. Furthermore, we identified 2 subjects consuming CMC who exhibited increased microbiota encroachment into the normally sterile inner mucus layer, a central feature of gut inflammation, as well as stark alterations in microbiota composition. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the notion that the broad use of CMC in processed foods may be contributing to increased prevalence of an array of chronic inflammatory diseases by altering the gut microbiome and metabolome (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03440229)."

DESIGN: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study randomised 165 patients with IBS to placebo (own faeces), 30 g FMT or 60 g FMT at a ratio of 1:1:1. The material for FMT was obtained from one healthy, well-characterised donor, frozen and administered via gastroscope. The primary outcome was a reduction in the IBS symptoms at 3 months after FMT (response). A response was defined as a decrease of 50 or more points in the total IBS symptom score. The secondary outcome was a reduction in the dysbiosis index (DI) and a change in the intestinal bacterial profile, analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, at 1 month following FMT. RESULTS: Responses occurred in 23.6%, 76.9% (p<0.0001) and 89.1% (p<00.0001) of the patients who received placebo, 30 g FMT and 60 g FMT, respectively. These were accompanied by significant improvements in fatigue and the quality of life in patients who received FMT. The intestinal bacterial profiles changed also significantly in the groups received FMT. The FMT adverse events were mild self-limiting gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: FMT is an effective treatment for patients with IBS. Utilising a well-defined donor with a normal DI and favourable specific microbial signature is essential for successful FMT. The response to FMT increases with the dose. Trial registration www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03822299) and www.cristin.no (ID657402)."
"Randomized Controlled Trial of Oral Vancomycin Treatment in Clostridioides difficile-Colonized Patients.","Fishbein SRS||Hink T||Reske KA||Cass C||Struttmann E||Iqbal ZH||Seiler S||Kwon JH||Burnham CA||Dantas G||Dubberke ER","mSphere","10.1128/mSphere.00936-20","6","1","2021","Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is most commonly diagnosed using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT); the low positive predictive value of these assays results in patients colonized with C. difficile unnecessarily receiving CDI treatment antibiotics. The risks and benefits of antibiotic treatment in individuals with such cases are unknown. Fecal samples of NAAT-positive, toxin enzyme immunoassay (EIA)-negative patients were collected before, during, and after randomization to vancomycin (n = 8) or placebo (n = 7). C. difficile and antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs) were selectively cultured from fecal and environmental samples. Shotgun metagenomics and comparative isolate genomics were used to understand the impact of oral vancomycin on the microbiome and environmental contamination. Overall, 80% of placebo patients and 71% of vancomycin patients were colonized with C. difficile posttreatment. One person randomized to placebo subsequently received treatment for CDI. In the vancomycin-treated group, beta-diversity (P = 0.0059) and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) resistance genes (P = 0.037) increased after treatment; C. difficile and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) environmental contamination was found in 53% of patients and 26% of patients, respectively. We found that vancomycin alters the gut microbiota, does not permanently clear C. difficile, and is associated with VRE colonization/environmental contamination. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT03388268.)IMPORTANCE A gold standard diagnostic for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) does not exist. An area of controversy is how to manage patients whose stool tests positive by nucleic acid amplification tests but negative by toxin enzyme immunoassay. Existing data suggest most of these patients do not have CDI, but most are treated with oral vancomycin. Potential benefits to treatment include a decreased risk for adverse outcomes if the patient does have CDI and the potential to decrease C. difficile shedding/transmission. However, oral vancomycin perturbs the intestinal microbiota and promotes antibiotic-resistant organism colonization/transmission. We conducted a double-blinded randomized controlled trial to assess the risk-benefit of oral vancomycin treatment in this population. Oral vancomycin did not result in long-term clearance of C. difficile, perturbed the microbiota, and was associated with colonization/shedding of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. This work underscores the need to better understand this population of patients in the context of C. difficile/ARO-related outcomes and transmission."

Although the mechanism of FMT is thought to be bacterial engraftment, the best approach to achieve engraftment after FMT in IBS-D (and other diseases) is not clear. We evaluated the effect of FMT (with or without pretreatment with antibiotics) on gut microbiome and symptoms in patients with IBS-D. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center study, 44 patients with IBS-D with a least moderate severity (IBS severity scoring system, i.e., IBS-SSS, >/=175) were randomly assigned to one of four groups: single-dose oral FMT alone, single-dose oral FMT following a 7-day pretreatment course of Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole (CM-FMT) or Rifaximin (R-FMT), or Placebo FMT. Primary endpoint was engraftment post-FMT and secondary endpoints were changes in IBS-SSS, and IBS-quality of life (IBS-QOL) at week 10. Median engraftment was significantly different among the three FMT groups (P = .013). Engraftment post-FMT was significantly higher in the FMT alone arm (15.5%) compared to that in R-FMT group (5%, P = .04) and CM-FMT group (2.4%, P = .002). The mean change in IBS-SSS and IBS-QOL from baseline were not significantly different among the four groups or between the three FMT groups combined vs. placebo at week 10. In summary, antibiotic pretreatment significantly reduced bacterial engraftment after FMT in patients with IBS-D."

Probiotics supplementation may improve constipation symptoms, but its effect on the gut microbiota population is unclear. METHODS: In this randomized controlled study, 46 PD patients with constipation according to Rome Ⅲ criteria were recruited. The number of complete bowel movements per week, degree of defecation effort, Bristol stool Scale (BSS), Patient Assessment of Constipation symptom (PAC-SYM) and Patient assessment of constipation quality of life questionnaire (PAC-QOL) were collected pre- and post-intervention to evaluate the constipation symptoms. In addition, fresh feces of subjects before and after intervention and healthy controls were collected for 16s rRNA gene V3-V4 region sequencing to compare bacterial flora differences. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the treatment group increased the average number of complete bowel movements per week (1.09 +/- 1.24 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.64, P &lt; 0.001). Probiotics supplementation reduced the BSS score (0.65 +/- 0.93 vs. -0.17 +/- 0.94, P = 0.004), PAC-SYM score (4.09 +/- 6.31 vs. -1.83 +/- 4.14, P &lt; 0.001), PAC-QOL score (10.65 +/- 16.53 vs. 0.57 +/- 12.82, P = 0.042), and degree of defecation effort score (1.00 +/- 0.80 vs. 0.00 +/- 0.30, P &lt; 0.001). The improvement rate of constipation in the probiotics group was significantly higher than that in the control group (52.2% vs. 8.7%, P = 0.001). PD patients showed intestinal flora disorders compared to healthy controls. After 12 weeks of probiotics treatment, g_Christensenella_sp._Marseille-P2437 significantly increased, while g_Eubacterium_oxidoreducens_group, g_Eubacterium_hallii_group and s_Odoribacter_sp._N54.MGS-14 decreased (p &lt; 0 0.05).

Limited studies have shown that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can reduce MDRO colonization, but its mechanisms are poorly understood. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of FMT for MDRO decolonization in renal transplant recipients called PREMIX (NCT02922816). Eleven participants were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to FMT or an observation period followed by delayed FMT if stool cultures were MDRO positive at day 36. Participants who were MDRO positive after one FMT were treated with a second FMT. At last visit, eight of nine patients who completed all treatments were MDRO culture negative. FMT-treated participants had longer time to recurrent MDRO infection versus PREMIX-eligible controls who were not treated with FMT. Key taxa (Akkermansia muciniphila, Alistipes putredinis, Phocaeicola dorei, Phascolarctobacterium faecium, Alistipes species, Mesosutterella massiliensis, Barnesiella intestinihominis, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) from the single feces donor used in the study that engrafted in recipients and metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids and bile acids in FMT-responding participants uncovered leads for rational microbiome therapeutic and diagnostic development. Metagenomic analyses revealed a previously unobserved mechanism of MDRO eradication by conspecific strain competition in an FMT-treated subset. Susceptible Enterobacterales strains that replaced baseline extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains were not detectable in donor microbiota manufactured as FMT doses but in one case were detectable in the recipient before FMT. These data suggest that FMT may provide a path to exploit strain competition to reduce MDRO colonization."

SER-109 is an investigational microbiome therapeutic composed of purified Firmicutes spores for the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in which patients who had had three or more episodes of C. difficile infection (inclusive of the qualifying acute episode) received SER-109 or placebo (four capsules daily for 3 days) after standard-of-care antibiotic treatment. The primary efficacy objective was to show superiority of SER-109 as compared with placebo in reducing the risk of C. difficile infection recurrence up to 8 weeks after treatment. Diagnosis by toxin testing was performed at trial entry, and randomization was stratified according to age and antibiotic agent received. Analyses of safety, microbiome engraftment, and metabolites were also performed. RESULTS: Among the 281 patients screened, 182 were enrolled. The percentage of patients with recurrence of C. difficile infection was 12% in the SER-109 group and 40% in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.58; P<0.001 for a relative risk of <1.0; P<0.001 for a relative risk of <0.833). SER-109 led to less frequent recurrence than placebo in analyses stratified according to age stratum (relative risk, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.78] for patients <65 years of age and 0.36 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.72] for those >/=65 years) and antibiotic received (relative risk, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.22 to 0.79] with vancomycin and 0.09 [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.63] with fidaxomicin). Most adverse events were mild to moderate and were gastrointestinal in nature, with similar numbers in the two groups. SER-109 dose species were detected as early as week 1 and were associated with bile-acid profiles that are known to inhibit C. difficile spore germination. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptom resolution of C. difficile infection after treatment with standard-of-care antibiotics, oral administration of SER-109 was superior to placebo in reducing the risk of recurrent infection. The observed safety profile of SER-109 was similar to that of placebo. (Funded by Seres Therapeutics; ECOSPOR III ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03183128.)."

Linezolid was shown to be active against Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, in vitro and in the rabbit model. We aimed to assess the efficacy of linezolid for treating early syphilis in adults compared with the standard of care benzathine penicillin G (BPG). METHODS: We did a multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of linezolid for treating early syphilis compared with BPG. We recruited participants with serological or molecular confirmation of syphilis (either primary, secondary, or early latent) at one STI unit in a public hospital and two STI community clinics in Catalonia (Spain). Participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated block randomisation list with six participants per block, to receive either oral linezolid (600 mg once per day for 5 days) or intramuscular BPG (single dose of 2.4 million international units) and were assessed for signs and symptoms (once per week until week 6 and at week 12, week 24, and week 48) and reagin titres of non-treponemal antibodies (week 12, week 24, and week 48). The primary endpoint was treatment response, assessed using a composite endpoint that included clinical response, serological response, and absence of relapse. Clinical response was assessed at 2 weeks for primary syphilis and at 6 weeks for secondary syphilis following treatment initiation. Serological cure was defined as a four-fold decline in rapid plasma reagin titre or seroreversion at any of the 12-week, 24-week, or 48-week timepoints. The absence of relapse was defined as the presence of different molecular sequence types of T pallidum in recurrent syphilis. Non-inferiority was shown if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in rates of treatment response was higher than -10%. The primary analysis was done in the per-protocol population. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05069974) and was stopped for futility after interim analysis. FINDINGS: Between Oct 20, 2021, and Sept 15, 2022, 62 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 59 were randomly assigned to linezolid (n=29) or BPG (n=30). In the per-protocol population, after 48 weeks' follow-up, 19 (70%) of 27 participants (95% CI 49.8 to 86.2) in the linezolid group had responded to treatment and 28 (100%) of 28 participants (87.7 to 100.0) in the BPG group (treatment difference -29.6, 95% CI -50.5 to -8.8), which did not meet the non-inferiority criterion. The number of drug-related adverse events (all mild or moderate) was similar in both treatment groups (five [17%] of 29, 95% CI 5.8 to 35.8 in the linezolid group vs five [17%] of 30, 5.6 to 34.7, in the BPG group). No serious adverse events were reported during follow-up. INTERPRETATION: The efficacy of linezolid at a daily dose of 600 mg for 5 days did not meet the non-inferiority criteria compared with BPG and, as a result, this treatment regimen should not be used to treat patients with early syphilis.

Microbiota restoration with faecal microbiota transplantation is an effective treatment option for patients with multiple recurring episodes of C difficile. We compared the efficacy and safety of faecal microbiota transplantation compared with placebo after vancomycin for first or second C difficile infection. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EarlyFMT) at a university hospital in Aarhus, Denmark. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with first or second C difficile infection (defined as >/=3 watery stools [Bristol stool chart score 6-7] per day and a positive C difficile PCR test). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to faecal microbiota transplantation or placebo administered on day 1 and between day 3 and 7, after they had received 125 mg oral vancomycin four times daily for 10 days. Randomisation was done by investigators using a computer-generated randomisation list provided by independent staff. Patients and investigators were masked to the treatment group. The primary endpoint was resolution of C difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) 8 weeks after treatment. We followed up patients for 8 weeks or until recurrence. We planned to enrol 84 patients with a prespecified interim analysis after 42 patients. The primary outcome and safety outcomes were analysed in the intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned patients. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04885946. FINDINGS: Between June 21, 2021, and April 1, 2022, we consecutively screened 86 patients, of whom 42 were randomly assigned to faecal microbiota transplantation (n=21) or placebo (n=21). The trial was stopped after the interim analysis done on April 7, 2022 for ethical reasons because a significantly lower rate of resolution was identified in the placebo group compared with the faecal microbiota transplantation group (Haybittle-Peto boundary limit p<0.001). 19 (90%; 95% CI 70-99) of 21 patients in the faecal microbiota transplantation group and seven (33%, 95% CI 15-57) of 21 patients in the placebo group had resolution of CDAD at week 8 (p=0.0003). The absolute risk reduction was 57% (95% CI 33-81). Overall, 204 adverse events occurred, with one or more adverse events being reported in 20 of 21 patients in the faecal microbiota transplantation group and all 21 patients in the placebo group. Diarrhoea (n=23 in the faecal microbiota transplantation group; n=14 in the placebo group) and abdominal pain (n=14 in the faecal microbiota transplantation group; n=11 in the placebo group) were the most common adverse events. Three serious adverse events possibly related to study treatment occurred (n=1 in the faecal microbiota transplantation group; n=2 in the placebo group), but no deaths or colectomies during the 8-week follow-up. INTERPRETATION: In patients with first or second C difficile infection, first-line faecal microbiota transplantation is highly effective and superior to the standard of care vancomycin alone in achieving sustained resolution from C difficile.

Currently, the possibility of regulating gut microbiota to reverse these perturbations by developing novel therapeutic and preventive strategies is being extensively investigated. The modulatory effect of vitamins on the gut microbiome and related host health benefits remain largely unclear. We investigated the effects of colon-delivered vitamins A, B2, C, D, and E on the gut microbiota using a human clinical study and batch fermentation experiments, in combination with cell models for the assessment of barrier and immune functions. Vitamins C, B2, and D may modulate the human gut microbiome in terms of metabolic activity and bacterial composition. The most distinct effect was that of vitamin C, which significantly increased microbial alpha diversity and fecal short-chain fatty acids compared to the placebo. The remaining vitamins tested showed similar effects on microbial diversity, composition, and/or metabolic activity in vitro, but in varying degrees. Here, we showed that vitamins may modulate the human gut microbiome. Follow-up studies investigating targeted delivery of vitamins to the colon may help clarify the clinical significance of this novel concept for treating and preventing dysbiotic microbiota-related human diseases.

It is acknowledged that probiotics supplementation mitigates side effects induced by H. pylori eradication, yet its role on alleviating dysbiosis of microbiota is obscure. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of probiotics on gastrointestinal microbiota after eradication therapy. METHODS: This was a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized trial done at seven centers in China. A total of 276 treatment-naive H. pylori-positive patients were randomly assigned to receive 14-day bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (esomeprazole, bismuth, amoxicillin, furazolidone) combined with probiotics (Bifidobacterium Tetragenous viable Bacteria Tablets) (n=140) or placebo (n=136) for 28 days. Saliva, gastric mucosa and fecal samples were collected before and after therapy for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events was lower in probiotics group compared to placebo group (23.6% vs 37.7%, p=0.016), while there was no significant difference in eradication rate. We found dramatic perturbations of gut microbiota immediately following eradication, with the predominance of Proteobacteria in replacement of commensal Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and gradually restored after two weeks. The reduction of gut Bacteroidetes caused by eradication drugs was neutralized with probiotics supplementation. The gastric microbiota was completely reconstituted with H. pylori depleted and other taxa flourished. Of note, patients treated with probiotics showed smaller fluctuations of gastric microbiota compared to those with placebo. We also observed changes of saliva microbiota after H. pylori eradication, illustrated by the overgrowth of Neisseria and depletion of Streptococcus. The expansion of some pathogenic genera, including Porphyromonas, Leptotrichia, in the mouth was suppressed by probiotics. CONCLUSION: This study not only demonstrated the beneficial effect of probiotics implementation on side events during H. pylori eradication but also provided a comprehensive profile of microbiome alterations along gastrointestinal tract that modulated by probiotics."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of VE303, a defined bacterial consortium of 8 strains of commensal Clostridia, in adults at high risk for CDI recurrence. The primary objective was to determine the recommended VE303 dosing for a phase 3 trial. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study conducted from February 2019 to September 2021 at 27 sites in the US and Canada. The study included 79 participants aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed CDI with 1 or more prior CDI episodes in the last 6 months and those with primary CDI at high risk for recurrence (defined as aged >/=75 years or >/=65 years with >/=1 risk factors: creatinine clearance <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, proton pump inhibitor use, remote [>6 months earlier] CDI history). INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to high-dose VE303 (8.0 x 109 colony-forming units [CFUs]) (n = 30), low-dose VE303 (1.6 x 109 CFUs) (n = 27), or placebo capsules (n = 22) orally once daily for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of participants with CDI recurrence at 8 weeks using a combined clinical and laboratory definition. The primary efficacy end point was analyzed in 3 prespecified analyses, using successively broader definitions for an on-study CDI recurrence: (1) diarrhea consistent with CDI plus a toxin-positive stool sample; (2) diarrhea consistent with CDI plus a toxin-positive, polymerase chain reaction-positive, or toxigenic culture-positive stool sample; and (3) diarrhea consistent with CDI plus laboratory confirmation or (in the absence of a stool sample) treatment with a CDI-targeted antibiotic. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar across the high-dose VE303 (n = 29; 1 additional participant excluded from efficacy analysis), low-dose VE303 (n = 27), and placebo (n = 22) groups. The participants' median age was 63.5 years (range, 24-96); 70.5% were female; and 1.3% were Asian, 1.3% Black, 2.6% Hispanic, and 96.2% White. CDI recurrence rates through week 8 (using the efficacy analysis 3 definition) were 13.8% (4/29) for high-dose VE303, 37.0% (10/27) for low-dose VE303, and 45.5% (10/22) for placebo (P = .006, high-dose VE303 vs placebo). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults with laboratory-confirmed CDI with 1 or more prior CDI episodes in the last 6 months and those with primary CDI at high risk for recurrence, high-dose VE303 prevented recurrent CDI compared with placebo. A larger, phase 3 study is needed to confirm these findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03788434."

However, previous topical strategies targeting the nose or skin had little success, and oral antibiotic-based decolonisation is ill advised because of eradication of the microbiota and development of antibiotic resistance. We previously showed that the probiotic Bacillus subtilis significantly diminished S aureus at the main intestinal colonisation site via specific bacterial interaction in mice; in this study, we tested this probiotic approach to control S aureus colonisation in humans. METHODS: We did a single-centre, phase 2, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in adults from the Songkhla region of Thailand who were colonised by S aureus. Eligible participants were adults (aged >/=18 years) without history of intestinal disease, antibiotic treatment, or hospital admission within the previous 90 days. Participants were excluded if they were pregnant, breastfeeding, taking probiotics, or had diarrhoea. Participants were allocated (1:1) to groups by computer randomisation in blocks of four, and research coordinators were masked to group allocation. Participants received 250 mg of probiotic B subtilis MB40 or placebo once per day for 30 days and S aureus colonisation was determined after the last dose was received. The primary outcome was colonisation by S aureus (continuous, mean decrease in colony-forming-unit count) in the intestine (by faecal counts) and nares (by nasal swabs) after intervention (30-day regimen of B subtilis probiotic).

FINDINGS: The trial was done between Jan 29 and June 30, 2021, with enrolment taking place from Jan 29 to April 6, 2021. 115 participants were colonised by S aureus, either in the intestine (n=84), nose (n=50), or both (n=19), and were randomly assigned to treatment (n=55) and placebo groups (n=60). Oral probiotic B subtilis resulted in significant reduction of S aureus in stool (96.8%; p<0.0001) and nose (65.4%; p=0.0002). There were no differences in adverse effects or significant microbiome changes between the intervention and placebo groups. INTERPRETATION: B subtilis probiotic eliminated more than 95% of the total S aureus colonising the human body without altering the microbiota. This probiotic strategy offers several key advantages over presently used decolonisation strategies for potential use in people with chronic or long-term risk of S aureus infection. Furthermore, by establishing a defining role of the intestinal colonisation site, our findings call for revisiting fundamental notions about S aureus colonisation.

A gut microbiota-immunological interplay is involved in the pathophysiology of T1D. We studied microbiota-mediated effects on disease progression in patients with type 1 diabetes using faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). DESIGN: Patients with recent-onset (<6 weeks) T1D (18-30 years of age) were randomised into two groups to receive three autologous or allogenic (healthy donor) FMTs over a period of 4 months. Our primary endpoint was preservation of stimulated C peptide release assessed by mixed-meal tests during 12 months. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in glycaemic control, fasting plasma metabolites, T cell autoimmunity, small intestinal gene expression profile and intestinal microbiota composition. RESULTS: Stimulated C peptide levels were significantly preserved in the autologous FMT group (n=10 subjects) compared with healthy donor FMT group (n=10 subjects) at 12 months. Small intestinal Prevotella was inversely related to residual beta cell function (r=-0.55, p=0.02), whereas plasma metabolites 1-arachidonoyl-GPC and 1-myristoyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC levels linearly correlated with residual beta cell preservation (rho=0.56, p=0.01 and rho=0.46, p=0.042, respectively). Finally, baseline CD4 +CXCR3+T cell counts, levels of small intestinal Desulfovibrio piger and CCL22 and CCL5 gene expression in duodenal biopsies predicted preserved beta cell function following FMT irrespective of donor characteristics. CONCLUSION: FMT halts decline in endogenous insulin production in recently diagnosed patients with T1D in 12 months after disease onset. Several microbiota-derived plasma metabolites and bacterial strains were linked to preserved residual beta cell function. This study provides insight into the role of the intestinal gut microbiome in T1D. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NTR3697."
"Effects of tetrathiomolybdate on copper metabolism in healthy volunteers and in patients with Wilson disease.","Kirk FT||Munk DE||Swenson ES||Quicquaro AM||Vendelbo MH||Larsen A||Schilsky ML||Ott P||Sandahl TD","Journal of hepatology","10.1016/j.jhep.2023.11.023","80","4","2024","BACKGROUND & AIMS: In Wilson disease (WD), copper accumulates in the liver and brain causing disease. Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a potent copper chelator that may be associated with a lower risk of inducing paradoxical neurological worsening than conventional therapy for neurologic WD. To better understand the mode of action of TTM, we investigated its effects on copper absorption and biliary excretion. METHODS: In a double-blind randomized setting, hepatic (64)Cu activity was examined after orally administered (64)Cu by PET/CT in 16 healthy volunteers before and after seven days of TTM treatment (15 mg/d) or placebo. Oral (64)Cu was administered one hour after the final TTM dose. Changes in hepatic (64)Cu activity reflected changes in intestinal (64)Cu uptake. Additionally, in four patients with WD, the distribution of (64)Cu in venous blood, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and brain was followed after i.v. (64)Cu dosing for up to 68 hours before and after seven days of TTM (15 mg/day), using PET/MRI. Increased gallbladder (64)Cu activity was taken as evidence of increased biliary (64)Cu excretion. RESULTS: In healthy volunteers, TTM reduced intestinal (64)Cu uptake by 82% 15 hours after the oral (64)Cu dose. In patients with WD, gallbladder (64)Cu activity was negligible before and after TTM, while TTM effectively retained (64)Cu in the blood, significantly reduced hepatic (64)Cu activity at all time-points and significantly reduced cerebral (64)Cu activity two hours after the intravenous (64)Cu dose. CONCLUSIONS: While we did not show an increase in biliary excretion of (64)Cu following TTM administration, we demonstrated that TTM effectively inhibited most intestinal (64)Cu uptake and retained (64)Cu in the blood stream, limiting the exposure of organs like the liver and brain to (64)Cu. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is an investigational copper chelator being developed for the treatment of Wilson disease. In animal models of Wilson disease, TTM has been shown to facilitate biliary copper excretion. In the present human study, TTM surprisingly did not facilitate biliary copper excretion but instead reduced intestinal copper uptake to a clinically significant degree. Our study builds on our understanding of human copper metabolism and the mechanism of action of TTM."
"Effect of probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum Dad-13 powder consumption on the gut microbiota and intestinal health of overweight adults.","Rahayu ES||Mariyatun M||Putri Manurung NE||Hasan PN||Therdtatha P||Mishima R||Komalasari H||Mahfuzah NA||Pamungkaningtyas FH||Yoga WK||Nurfiana DA||Liwan SY||Juffrie M||Nugroho AE||Utami T","World journal of gastroenterology","10.3748/wjg.v27.i1.107","27","1","2021","BACKGROUND: Shifting on lifestyle, diet, and physical activity contributed on increasing number of obese people around the world. Multiple factors influence the development of obesity. Some research suggested that gut microbiota (GM) plays an important role in nutrient absorption and energy regulation of individuals, thus affecting their nutritional status. Report of Indonesia Basic Health Research showed that the prevalence of obesity in every province tended to increase. Although the root cause of obesity is excessive calorie intake compared with expenditure, the differences in gut microbial ecology between healthy and obese humans may affect energy homeostasis. GM affect body weight, especially obesity. Probiotics that are consumed while alive and able to colonize in the intestine are expected to increase the population of good bacteria, especially Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, and suppress pathogens such as Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus. The strain of L. plantarum Dad-13 has been demonstrated to survive and colonize in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy Indonesian adults who consume fermented milk containing L. plantarum Dad-13. The consumption of probiotic L. plantarum Dad-13 powder decreased E. coli and non-E. coli coliform bacteria in school-aged children in Indonesia. L. plantarum is a dominant bacterium in the average Indonesian's GM. For this reason, this bacterium is probably a more suitable probiotic for Indonesians. AIM: To determine the effect of the consumption of indigenous probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum Dad-13 powder in overweight adults in Yogyakarta (Indonesia). METHODS: Sixty overweight volunteers with a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 25 consume indigenous probiotic powder L. plantarum Dad-13 (2 x 10(9) CFU/gram/sachet) for 90 d. The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The volunteers filled in a diary on a daily basis, which consisted of questions on study product intake (only during ingestion period), other food intake, number of bowel movements, fecal quality (consistency and color), any medications received, and any symptom of discomfort, such as diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, gassing, sensation of illness, etc. Fecal samples and the subjects' diaries were collected on the morning of day 10 + 1, which was marked as the end of the baseline period and the start of the ingestion period. During the ingestion period (from day 11 to day 101), several parameters to measure and analyze the results included body weight and height (once a month), the lipid profile, GM analysis using MiSeq, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis using gas chromatography, and the measurement of fecal pH using a pH meter. RESULTS: The consumption of indigenous probiotic powder L. plantarum Dad-13 caused the average body weight and BMI of the probiotic group to decrease from 84.54 +/- 17.64 kg to 83.14 +/- 14.71 kg and 33.10 +/- 6.15 kg/m(2) to 32.57 +/- 5.01 kg/m(2), respectively. No significant reduction of body weight and BMI in the placebo group was observed. An analysis of the microbiota showed that the number of Bacteroidetes, specifically Prevotella, increased significantly, while that of Firmicutes significantly decreased. No significant change in lipid profile in both groups was found. Also, no significant change in SCFAs (e.g., butyrate, propionate, acetic acid) and pH level was found after the consumption of the probiotic. CONCLUSION: No significant differences in pH before and after ingestion were observed in both the probiotic and placebo groups as well as in the lipid profile of both cholesterol and triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and the LDL/HDL ratio. In addition, no significant changes in the concentration of SCFAs (e.g., acetic acid, propionate, and butyrate) were found after con-sumption. Interestingly, a significant decrease in body weight and BMI (P < 0.05) was determined in the treatment group. An analysis of GM shows that L. plantarum Dad-13 caused the Firmicutes population to decrease and the Bacteroidetes population (especially Prevotella) to increase."

Perturbed microbial colonization during critical early-life windows of development alters metabolic and immune programming and is associated with an increased risk of immune and metabolic diseases. In nonrandomized studies, vaginal seeding of C-section-born neonates partially restores their microbiota colonization to that of their vaginally delivered counterparts, but without randomization, confounding factors cannot be excluded. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we determined the effect of vaginal seeding versus placebo seeding (control arm) on the skin and stool microbiota of elective, prelabor C-section-born neonates (n = 20) at 1 day and 1 month after birth. We also examined whether there were between-arm differences in engraftment of maternal microbes in the neonatal microbiota. In relation to the control arm, vaginal seeding increased mother-to-neonate microbiota transmission and caused compositional changes and a reduction in alpha diversity (Shannon Index) of the skin and stool microbiota. The neonatal skin and stool microbiota alpha diversity when maternal vaginal microbiota is provided is intriguing and highlights the need of larger randomized studies to determine the ecological mechanisms and effects of vaginal seeding on clinical outcomes. IMPORTANCE Children delivered by elective C-section are not exposed to the birth canal and show altered microbiota development. Impairing microbial colonization during early life alters metabolic and immune programming and is associated with an increased risk of immune and metabolic diseases.

METHODS: Part I was an open-label trial of CurQD in patients with active UC, defined by a Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index score of 5 or higher and a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 2 or higher. Part II was a placebo-controlled trial conducted in Israel and Greece, randomizing active UC patients at a 2:1 ratio to enteric-coated CurQD 3 g/d or placebo for 8 weeks. The co-primary outcome was clinical response (reduction in the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index of >/=3 points) and an objective response (Mayo endoscopic subscore improvement of >/=1 or a 50% fecal calprotectin reduction). Responding patients continued either maintenance curcumin or placebo alone for an additional 8 weeks. Aryl-hydrocarbon receptor activation was assessed by cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) mucosal expression. RESULTS: In part I, 7 of 10 patients responded and 3 of 10 achieved clinical remission. Of 42 patients in part II, the week 8 co-primary outcome was achieved in 43% and 8% of CurQD and placebo patients, respectively (P = .033). Clinical response was observed in 85.7% vs 30.7% (P < .001), clinical remission in 14 of 28 (50%) vs 1 of 13 (8%; P = .01), a 50% calprotectin reduction in 46.4% vs 15.4% (P = .08), and endoscopic improvement in 75% vs 20% (P = .036) in the CurQD and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse events were comparable between groups. By week 16, curcumin-maintained clinical response, clinical remission, and clinical biomarker response rates were 93%, 80%, and 40%, respectively. CurQD uniquely up-regulated mucosal CYP1A1 expression, which was not observed among patients receiving placebo, mesalamine, or biologics. CONCLUSIONS: In this placebo-controlled trial, CurQD was effective for inducing response and remission in active UC patients. The aryl-hydrocarbon receptor pathway may merit further study as a potential UC treatment target. CLINICALTRIALS: gov ID: NCT03720002."

METHODS: AntiBiotics for Children with severe Diarrhea was a 7-country, placebo-controlled, double-blind efficacy trial of azithromycin in children 2-23 months of age with watery diarrhea accompanied by dehydration or malnutrition. We tested fecal samples for enteric pathogens utilizing quantitative polymerase chain reaction to identify likely and possible bacterial etiologies and employed pathogen-specific cutoffs based on genomic target quantity in previous case-control diarrhea etiology studies to identify likely and possible bacterial etiologies. RESULTS: Among 6692 children, the leading likely etiologies were rotavirus (21.1%), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli encoding heat-stable toxin (13.3%), Shigella (12.6%), and Cryptosporidium (9.6%). More than one-quarter (1894 [28.3%]) had a likely and 1153 (17.3%) a possible bacterial etiology. Day 3 diarrhea was less common in those randomized to azithromycin versus placebo among children with a likely bacterial etiology (risk difference [RD]likely, -11.6 [95% confidence interval CI, -15.6 to -7.6]) and possible bacterial etiology (RDpossible, -8.7 [95% CI, -13.0 to -4.4]) but not in other children (RDunlikely, -0.3% [95% CI, -2.9% to 2.3%]).

Spleen-strengthening and liver-draining formula (SLF) is a formula formed according to the theory of ""One Qi Circulation"" (Qing Dynasty, 1749) of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which has shown significant therapeutic effect in patients with NAFLD in a preliminary clinical observation. In this study, we aim to explore the mechanism of SLF against NAFLD, especially its effect on glucolipid metabolism, from the perspective of intestinal flora. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study was designed to observe the efficacy and safety of SLF in the treatment of NAFLD. The study participants were randomly and evenly divided into control group and treatment group (SLF group). The control group made lifestyle adjustments, while the SLF group was treated with SLF on top of the control group. Both groups were participated in the study for 12 consecutive weeks. Furthermore, the feces of the two groups were collected before and after treatment. The intestinal flora of each group and healthy control (HC) were detected utilizing 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the SLF group showed significant improvements in liver function, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), and liver stiffness measurement (LSM), meanwhile, patients had significantly lower lipid and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) with better security. Intestinal flora 16S rRNA gene sequencing results indicated reduced flora diversity and altered species abundance in patients with NAFLD. At the phylum level, Desulfobacterota levels were reduced. Although Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes did not differ significantly between HC and NAFLD, when grouped by alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels in NAFLD, Firmicutes levels were significantly higher in patients with ALT or AST abnormalities, while Bacteroidetes was significantly lower. Clinical correlation analysis showed that Firmicutes positively correlated with gender, age, ALT, AST, LSM, and Fibroscan-AST (FAST) score, while the opposite was true for Bacteroidetes. At the genus level, the levels of Alistipes, Bilophila, Butyricimonas, Coprococcus, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 group Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcus, UCG-002, and UCG-003 were reduced, whereas abundance of Tyzzerella increased. There was no statistically significant difference in Firmicutes and Bacteroidota levels in the SLF group before and after treatment, but both bacteria tended to retrace. At the genus level, Coprococcus (Lachnospiraceae family), Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 group (Lachnospiraceae family), and Ruminococcus (Ruminococcaceae family) were significantly higher in the SLF group after treatment, and there was also a tendency for Bilophila (Desulfovibrionaceae family) to be back-regulated toward HC. CONCLUSIONS: SLF can improve liver function and glucolipid metabolism in patients with NAFLD and lower down liver fat content to some extent. SLF could be carried out by regulating the disturbance of intestinal flora, especially Coprococcus, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 group, and Ruminococcus genus."

METHODS: We performed a double-blind phase 2 trial of 104 patients with NAFLD in the United Kingdom. Participants (mean age, 50.8 +/- 12.6 years; 65% men; 37% with diabetes) were randomly assigned to groups given the synbiotic agents (fructo-oligosaccharides, 4 g twice per day, plus Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis BB-12; n = 55) or placebo (n = 49) for 10-14 months. Liver fat content was measured at the start and end of the study by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and liver fibrosis was determined from a validated biomarker scoring system and vibration-controlled transient elastography. Fecal samples were collected at the start and end of the study, the fecal microbiome were analyzed by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Mean baseline and end-of-study magnetic resonance spectroscopy liver fat percentage values were 32.3% +/- 24.8% and 28.5% +/- 20.1% in the synbiotic group and 31.3% +/- 22% and 25.2% +/- 17.2% in the placebo group. In the unadjusted intention-to-treat analysis, we found no significant difference in liver fat reduction between groups (beta = 2.8; 95% confidence interval, -2.2 to 7.8; P = .30). In a fully adjusted regression model (adjusted for baseline measurement of the outcome plus age, sex, weight difference, and baseline weight), only weight loss was associated with a significant decrease in liver fat (beta = 2; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.6; P = .03). Fecal samples from patients who received the synbiotic had higher proportions of Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium species, and reductions in Oscillibacter and Alistipes species, compared with baseline; these changes were not observed in the placebo group. Changes in the composition of fecal microbiota were not associated with liver fat or markers of fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial of patients with NAFLD, 1 year of administration of a synbiotic combination (probiotic and prebiotic) altered the fecal microbiome but did not reduce liver fat content or markers of liver fibrosis.

We postulated that rifaximin-alpha reduces gut microbiota-derived endotoxemia and systemic inflammation, a known driver of HE. METHODS: In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, mechanistic study, 38 patients with cirrhosis and HE were randomised 1:1 to receive either rifaximin-alpha (550 mg BID) or placebo for 90 days. PRIMARY OUTCOME: 50% reduction in neutrophil oxidative burst (OB) at 30 days. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: changes in psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) and neurocognitive functioning, shotgun metagenomic sequencing of saliva and faeces, plasma and faecal metabolic profiling, whole blood bacterial DNA quantification, neutrophil toll-like receptor (TLR)-2/4/9 expression and plasma/faecal cytokine analysis. RESULTS: Patients were well-matched: median MELD (11 rifaximin-alpha vs. 10 placebo). Rifaximin-alpha did not lead to a 50% reduction in spontaneous neutrophil OB at 30 days compared to baseline (p = 0.48). However, HE grade normalised (p = 0.014) and PHES improved (p = 0.009) after 30 days on rifaximin-alpha. Rifaximin-alpha reduced circulating neutrophil TLR-4 expression on day 30 (p = 0.021) and plasma tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (p <0.001). Rifaximin-alpha suppressed oralisation of the gut, reducing levels of mucin-degrading sialidase-rich species, Streptococcus spp, Veillonella atypica and parvula, Akkermansia and Hungatella. Rifaximin-alpha promoted a TNF-alpha- and interleukin-17E-enriched intestinal microenvironment, augmenting antibacterial responses to invading pathobionts and promoting gut barrier repair. Those on rifaximin-alpha were less likely to develop infection (odds ratio 0.21; 95% CI 0.05-0.96). CONCLUSION: Rifaximin-alpha led to resolution of overt and covert HE, reduced the likelihood of infection, reduced oralisation of the gut and attenuated systemic inflammation. Rifaximin-alpha plays a role in gut barrier repair, which could be the mechanism by which it ameliorates bacterial translocation and systemic endotoxemia in cirrhosis. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02019784. LAY SUMMARY: In this clinical trial, we examined the underlying mechanism of action of an antibiotic called rifaximin-alpha which has been shown to be an effective treatment for a complication of chronic liver disease which effects the brain (termed encephalopathy). We show that rifaximin-alpha suppresses gut bacteria that translocate from the mouth to the intestine and cause the intestinal wall to become leaky by breaking down the protective mucus barrier. This suppression resolves encephalopathy and reduces inflammation in the blood, preventing the development of infection."

Previous studies in these patients have shown improvements in various microbiome indices after fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). However, whether microbiome improvements translate into improved clinical outcomes remains unclear. We examined this question in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial. METHODS: Two independent cohorts of allogeneic HCT recipients and patients with AML receiving induction chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive standardized oral encapsulated FMT versus placebo upon neutrophil recovery. After each course of antibacterial antibiotics, patients received a study treatment. Up to three treatments were administered within 3 months. The primary end point was 4-month all-cause infection rate. Patients were followed for 9 months. RESULTS: In the HCT cohort (74 patients), 4-month infection density was 0.74 and 0.91 events per 100 patient-days in FMT and placebo arms, respectively (infection rate ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.48 to 1.42; P = .49). In the AML cohort (26 patients), 4-month infection density was 0.93 in the FMT arm and 1.25 in the placebo arm, with an infection rate ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.32 to 1.71; P = .48). Unique donor bacterial sequences comprised 25%-30% of the fecal microbiota after FMT. FMT improved postantibiotic recovery of microbiota diversity, restored several depleted obligate anaerobic commensals, and reduced the abundance of expanded genera Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Dialister. CONCLUSION: In allogeneic HCT recipients and patients with AML, third-party FMT was safe and ameliorated intestinal dysbiosis, but did not decrease infections. Novel findings from this trial will inform future development of FMT trials."

METHODS: This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized patients with mild to moderate (Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index [SCCAI]: 3-9) endoscopically active UC (Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity [UCEIS] >1) in 1:1 ratio to CW + standard medical therapy (SMT) vs placebo + SMT. Four hundred mL of CW was administered for 8 weeks. Primary outcome measure was clinical remission (SCCAI </=2), and secondary outcome measures were clinical response (SCCAI decline >/=3) and adverse events at 8 weeks. Microbiome was analyzed at baseline and 8 weeks. RESULTS: Of 121 patients screened, 95 were included for modified intention to treat analysis (CW, n = 49; placebo, n = 46) (mean age, 37.2 +/- 11.2 years; males, 54.1%; disease duration, 48 months [interquartile range (IQR), 24-90 months]; pancolitis, 26.1%; SCCAI, 5 [IQR, 4-6]; UCEIS, 4 [IQR, 3-5]). Clinical response (57.1% vs 28.3%; odds ratio [OR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-7.9; P = .01), remission (53.1% vs 28.3%; OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-6.7; P = .02), and proportion of patients with fecal calprotectin (FCP) <150 mug/g (30.6% vs 6.5%; OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.7-23.6; P = .003) were significantly higher in CW. The relative abundance of bacterial taxa that had a significant or trend towards negative correlation with SCCAI, UCEIS, or FCP increased at 8 weeks in CW, and this effect was independent of disease activity and dietary fiber. Adverse events were comparable, and no patient developed hyperkalemia. CONCLUSIONS: CW was more effective than placebo for induction of clinical remission in patients with mild to moderate UC. The trial was prospectively registered on Clinical Trials Registry of India (ctri.nic.in, Number: CTRI/2019/03/01827)."
"A Phase II Randomized Clinical Trial and Mechanistic Studies Using Improved Probiotics to Prevent Oral Mucositis Induced by Concurrent Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.","Xia C||Jiang C||Li W||Wei J||Hong H||Li J||Feng L||Wei H||Xin H||Chen T","Frontiers in immunology","10.3389/fimmu.2021.618150","12",NA,"2021","Earlier evidence has proven that probiotic supplements can reduce concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT)-induced oral mucositis (OM) in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). The incidence of severe OM (grade 3 or higher) was the primary endpoint in this study. We first enrolled 85 patients with locally advanced NPC who were undergoing CCRT. Of them, 77 patients were finally selected and randomized (1:1) to receive either a probiotic cocktail or placebo. To investigate the protective effects and the mechanism of probiotic cocktail treatment on OM induced by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, we randomly divided the rats into the control (C) group, the model (M) group, and the probiotic (P) group. After treatment, samples from the tongue, blood, and fecal and proximal colon tissues on various days (7th, 14th, and 21st days) were collected and tested for the inflammatory response, cell apoptosis, intestinal permeability, and intestinal microbial changes. We found that patients taking the probiotic cocktail showed significantly lower OM. The values of the incidence of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 grades of OM in the placebo group and in the probiotic cocktail group were reported to be 0, 14.7, 38.2, 32.4, and 14.7% and 13.9, 36.1, 25, 22.2, and 2.8%, respectively. Furthermore, patients in the probiotic cocktail group showed a decrease in the reduction rate of CD3(+) T cells (75.5% vs. 81%, p < 0.01), CD4(+) T cells (64.53% vs. 79.53%, p < 0.01), and CD8(+) T cells (75.59 vs. 62.36%, p < 0.01) compared to the placebo group. In the rat model, the probiotic cocktail could ameliorate the severity of OM, decrease the inflammatory response, cause cell apoptosis and intestinal permeability, and restore the structure of gut microbiota to normalcy. In conclusion, the modified probiotic cocktail significantly reduces the severity of OM by enhancing the immune response of patients with NPC and modifying the structure of gut microbiota.

Gastroenterology & hepatology","10.1016/S2468-1253(22)00384-3","8","3","2023","BACKGROUND: Levofloxacin-based therapy or bismuth-based quadruple therapy are the recommended second-line regimens for Helicobacter pylori eradication after failure of clarithromycin-based therapy. However, resistance to levofloxacin has increased in the past decade. Furthermore, little is known about the long-term effects of H pylori eradication on the antibiotic resistome. In this study, we compared these second-line eradication therapies for efficacy, tolerability, and short-term and long-term effects on the gut microbiota, antibiotic resistome, and metabolic parameters. METHODS: We did a multicentre, open-label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial at eight hospitals in Taiwan. Adult patients (age >/=20 years) with persistent H pylori infection after first-line clarithromycin-based therapy were randomly assigned (1:1, permuted block sizes of four) to receive levofloxacin-based sequential quadruple therapy for 14 days (EAML14; esomeprazole 40 mg and amoxicillin 1 g for 7 days, followed by esomeprazole 40 mg, metronidazole 500 mg, and levofloxacin 250 mg for 7 days, all twice-daily) or bismuth-based quadruple therapy for 10 days (BQ10; esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily, bismuth tripotassium dicitrate 300 mg four times a day, tetracycline 500 mg four times a day, and metronidazole 500 mg three times a day). All investigators were masked to the randomisation sequence. The primary endpoint was H pylori eradication rate measured by (13)C urea breath test 6 weeks after second-line treatment according to both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analysis. The microbiota composition and antibiotic resistome of faecal samples collected at baseline (before treatment) and at 2 weeks, 8 weeks, and 1 year after eradication therapy was profiled by shotgun metagenomic sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The frequency of adverse effects and changes in the gut microbiota and antibiotic resistome were assessed in all participants with available data. The trial is complete and registered with ClinicalTrails.gov, NCT03148366. FINDINGS: Between Feb 25, 2015, and Dec 11, 2020, 560 patients were randomly assigned to receive EAML14 or BQ10 (n=280 per group; 261 [47%] men and 299 [53%] women). Mean age was 55.9 years (SD 12.7) in the EAML14 group and 54.9 years (12.3) in the BQ10 group. Eradication of H pylori was achieved in 246 (88%) of 280 participants in the EAML14 group and 245 (88%) of 280 in the BQ10 group according to ITT analysis (risk difference -0.4%, 95% CI -5.8 to 5.1; p=0.90). In the per-protocol analysis, 246 (90%) of 273 participants in the EAML14 group and 245 (93%) of 264 participants in the BQ10 group achieved H pylori eradication (risk difference 2.7%, 95% CI -0.2 to 7.4; p=0.27). Transient perturbation of faecal microbiota diversity at week 2 was largely restored to basal state 1 year after EAML14 or BQ10. Diversity recovery was slower with BQ10, and recovery in species abundance was partial after both therapies. On shotgun sequencing, we observed significant increases in total resistome after EAML14 (p=0.0002) and BQ10 (p=4.3 x 10(-10)) at week 2, which were restored to pretreatment level by week 8. The resistance rates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia to levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin (ampicillin-sulbactam for K pneumonia), and various cephalosporins were significantly increased in the EAML14 group compared with in the BQ10 group at week 2, which were restored to pretreatment levels and showed no significant differences at week 8 and 1 year. The frequency of any adverse effects was significantly higher after BQ10 therapy (211 [77%] of 273 participants) than after EAML14 therapy (134 [48%] of 277; p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence of superiority between levofloxacin-based quadruple therapy and bismuth-based quadruple therapy in the second-line treatment of H pylori infection. The transient increase in the antibiotic resistome and perturbation of faecal microbiota diversity were largely restored to pretreatment state from 2 months to 1 year after eradication therapy.

The study included eighty patients with moderate and severe IBS-D who were randomized to receive synbiotics or placebo for eight weeks. Finally, a total of sixty-eight patients finished the study. The primary endpoints included the assessment of the symptoms' severity with IBS symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS), an improvement of IBS global symptoms with Global Improvement Scale (IBS-GIS) and adequate relief of symptoms after four and eight weeks of therapy. Secondary endpoints, which were collected by telephone interviewers three times a week included the assessment of individual IBS symptoms and adverse events. Synbiotic treatment in comparison to placebo significantly improved IBS-GIS (p = 0.043), and IBS-SSS score inducing a decrease in the total IBS-SSS (p = 0.042) and in domain-specific scores related to flatulence (p = 0.028) and bowel habit (p = 0.028) after four and eight weeks. Patients treated with synbiotics reported in weekly observations a significant amelioration in a feeling of incomplete bowel movements, flatulence, pain, stool pressure and diarrheal stools compared to those receiving placebo. There were no differences in adverse events between both groups. Concluding, the multi-strain synbiotic preparation was associated with a significant improvement in symptoms in IBS-D patients and was well-tolerated. These results suggest that the use of synbiotics offers a benefit for IBS-D patients. [Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04206410 registered 20 December 2019]."

This study explored the therapeutic potential of a non-absorbable, gut-restricted, engineered carbon bead adsorbent, Yaq-001 in models of cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and, its safety and tolerability in a clinical trial in cirrhosis. DESIGN: Performance of Yaq-001 was evaluated in vitro. Two-rat models of cirrhosis and ACLF, (4 weeks, bile duct ligation with or without lipopolysaccharide), receiving Yaq-001 for 2 weeks; and two-mouse models of cirrhosis (6-week and 12-week carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)) receiving Yaq-001 for 6 weeks were studied. Organ and immune function, gut permeability, transcriptomics, microbiome composition and metabolomics were analysed. The effect of faecal water on gut permeability from animal models was evaluated on intestinal organoids. A multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 28 patients with cirrhosis, administered 4 gr/day Yaq-001 for 3 months was performed. RESULTS: Yaq-001 exhibited rapid adsorption kinetics for endotoxin. In vivo, Yaq-001 reduced liver injury, progression of fibrosis, portal hypertension, renal dysfunction and mortality of ACLF animals significantly. Significant impact on severity of endotoxaemia, hyperammonaemia, liver cell death, systemic inflammation and organ transcriptomics with variable modulation of inflammation, cell death and senescence in the liver, kidneys, brain and colon was observed. Yaq-001 reduced gut permeability in the organoids and impacted positively on the microbiome composition and metabolism. Yaq-001 regulated as a device met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability in the clinical trial. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides strong preclinical rationale and safety in patients with cirrhosis to allow clinical translation. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03202498."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei strain Shirota (LcS), formerly Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota, on constipation in patients with depression with specific etiology and gut microbiota and on depressive regimens. Eighty-two patients with constipation were recruited. The subjects consumed 100 mL of a LcS beverage (10(8) CFU/mL) or placebo every day for 9 weeks. After ingesting beverages for this period, we observed no significant differences in the total patient constipation-symptom (PAC-SYM) scores in the LcS group when compared with the placebo group. However, symptoms/scores in item 7 (rectal tearing or bleeding after a bowel movement) and items 8-12 (stool symptom subscale) were more alleviated in the LcS group than in the placebo group. The Beck Depression Index (BDI) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores were all significantly decreased, and the degree of depression was significantly improved in both the placebo and LcS groups (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the groups. The LcS intervention increased the beneficial Adlercreutzia, Megasphaera and Veillonella levels and decreased the bacterial levels related to mental illness, such as Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Sutterella and Oscillibacter. Additionally, the interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were significantly decreased in both the placebo and LcS groups (p < 0.05). In particular, the IL-6 levels were significantly lower in the LcS group than the placebo group after the ingestion period (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the daily consumption of LcS for 9 weeks appeared to relieve constipation and improve the potentially depressive symptoms in patients with depression and significantly decrease the IL-6 levels. In addition, the LcS supplementation also appeared to regulate the intestinal microbiota related to mental illness."

In this pilot randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of quadruple antibiotic cocktail in addition to intravenous-corticosteroids (IVCSs) in acute severe colitis (ASC). METHODS: Hospitalized children with ASC (pediatric ulcerative colitis activity index [PUCAI] >/=65) were randomized into 2 arms: the first received antibiotics in addition to IVCS (amoxicillin, vancomycin, metronidazole, doxycycline/ciprofloxacin [IVCS+AB]), whereas the other received only IVCS for 14 days. The primary outcome was disease activity (PUCAI) at day 5. Microbiome was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene and metagenome. RESULTS: Twenty-eight children were included: 16 in the AB + IVCS arm and 12 in the IVCS arm (mean age 13.9 +/- 4.1 years and 23 [82%] with extensive colitis). The mean day-5 PUCAI was 25 +/- 16.7 vs 40.4 +/- 20.4, respectively (P = 0.037). Only 3 and 2 children, respectively, required colectomy during 1-year follow-up (P = 0.89). Microbiome data at time of admission were analyzed for 25 children, of whom 17 (68%) had a predominant bacterial species (>33% abundance); response was not associated with the specific species, whereas decreased microbiome diversity at admission was associated with day-5 response in the IVCS arm. CONCLUSION: Patients with ASC have alterations in the microbiome characterized by loss of diversity and presence of predominant bacterial species. Quadruple therapy in addition to IVCS improved disease activity on day 5, but larger studies are needed to determine whether this is associated with improved long-term outcomes (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02033408)."

In this exploratory, proof-of-concept study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of FMT in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). METHODS: In this double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, superiority trial, we randomly allocated (1:1) adults with active peripheral PsA (>/=3 swollen joints) despite ongoing treatment with methotrexate to one gastroscopic-guided FMT or sham transplantation into the duodenum. Safety was monitored throughout the trial. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants experiencing treatment failure (ie, needing treatment intensification) through 26 weeks. Key secondary endpoints were change in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR20) response at week 26. RESULTS: Of 97 screened, 31 (32%) underwent randomisation (15 allocated to FMT) and 30 (97%) completed the 26-week clinical evaluation. No serious adverse events were observed. Treatment failure occurred more frequently in the FMT group than in the sham group (9 (60%) vs 3 (19%); risk ratio, 3.20; 95% CI 1.06 to 9.62; p=0.018).

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover intervention trial was conducted with 69 participants (36 in Group A, 33 in Group B), aiming to investigate the potential of postbiotics in alleviating diarrhea-associated symptoms. Participants received postbiotic Probio-Eco(R) and placebo for 21 days each in alternating order, with a 14-day washout period between interventions. The results showed that postbiotic intake resulted in significant improvements in Bristol stool scale score, defecation frequency, urgency, and anxiety. Moreover, the postbiotic intervention increased beneficial intestinal bacteria, including Dysosmobacter welbionis and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, while reducing potential pathogens like Megamonas funiformis. The levels of gut Microviridae notably increased. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis revealed postbiotic-driven enrichment of beneficial metabolites, including alpha-linolenic acid and p-methoxycinnamic acid, and reduction of diarrhea-associated metabolites, including theophylline, piperine, capsaicin, and phenylalanine. Targeted metabolomics confirmed a significant increase in fecal butyric acid after postbiotic intervention. The levels of aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine and tryptophan, and their related metabolites, 5-hydroxytryptophan and kynurenine, decreased after the postbiotic intervention, suggesting diarrhea alleviation was through modulating the tryptophan-5-hydroxytryptamine and tryptophan-kynurenine pathways. Additionally, chenodeoxycholic acid, a diarrhea-linked primary bile acid, decreased substantially. In conclusion, postbiotics have shown promise in relieving chronic diarrhea."

Here, using metagenomics, we profile phage populations - the phageome - in individuals recruited into two double-blind randomized trials of FMT in ulcerative colitis. We leverage the trial designs to observe that phage populations behave similarly to bacterial populations, showing temporal stability in health, dysbiosis in active disease, modulation by antibiotic treatment and by FMT. We identify a donor bacteriophage putatively associated with disease remission, which on genomic analysis was found integrated in a bacterium classified to Oscillospiraceae, previously isolated from a centenarian and predicted to produce vitamin B complex except B12. Our study provides an in-depth assessment of phage populations during different states and suggests that bacteriophage tracking has utility in identifying determinants of disease activity and resolution."

In the human gut microbiome, phages have been implicated in influencing human health, with successful engraftment of donor phages correlated with FMT treatment efficacy. The impact that gastrointestinal phages exert on human health has primarily been connected to their ability to modulate the bacterial communities in the gut. Nonetheless, how FMT affects recipients' phage populations, and in turn, how this influences the gut environment, is not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of FMT on the phageome composition of participants within the Gut Bugs Trial (GBT), a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that investigated the efficacy of FMT in treating obesity and comorbidities in adolescents. Stool samples collected from donors at the time of treatment and recipients at four time points (i.e., baseline and 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 26 weeks post-intervention), underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Phage sequences were identified and characterized in silico to examine evidence of phage engraftment and to assess the extent of FMT-induced alterations in the recipients' phageome composition. RESULTS: Donor phages engrafted stably in recipients following FMT, composing a significant proportion of their phageome for the entire course of the study (33.8 +/- 1.2% in females and 33.9 +/- 3.7% in males). Phage engraftment varied between donors and donor engraftment efficacy was positively correlated with their phageome alpha diversity. FMT caused a shift in recipients' phageome toward the donors' composition and increased phageome alpha diversity and variability over time. CONCLUSIONS: FMT significantly altered recipients' phage and, overall, microbial populations. The increase in microbial diversity and variability is consistent with a shift in microbial population dynamics. This proposes that phages play a critical role in modulating the gut environment and suggests novel approaches to understanding the efficacy of FMT in altering the recipient's microbiome.

Of 153 participants (76 FMT, 77 placebo) with an average age of 66.5 years, 25 participants (32.9%) in the FMT arm and 23 (29.9%) in the placebo arm experienced the primary endpoint of diarrhea and possible or definite CDI recurrence or death within 56 days of capsule administration (absolute difference, 3.0% [95% confidence interval, -11.7% to 17.7%]). Stratification by number of recurrences revealed no statistically significant differences. There were no clinically important differences in adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: FMT therapy versus placebo did not reduce CDI recurrence or death at 56 days. There were no meaningful differences in adverse events between treatment groups.

"Compared to histamine-2 receptor antagonist, proton pump inhibitor induces stronger oral-to-gut microbial transmission and gut microbiome alterations: a randomised controlled trial.","Zhu J||Sun C||Li M||Hu G||Zhao XM||Chen WH","Gut","10.1136/gutjnl-2023-330168","73","7","2024","OBJECTIVE: We aim to compare the effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) on the gut microbiota through longitudinal analysis. DESIGN: Healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either PPI (n=23) or H2RA (n=26) daily for seven consecutive days. We collected oral (saliva) and faecal samples before and after the intervention for metagenomic next-generation sequencing. We analysed intervention-induced alterations in the oral and gut microbiome including microbial abundance and growth rates, oral-to-gut transmissions, and compared differences between the PPI and H2RA groups. RESULTS: Both interventions disrupted the gut microbiota, with PPIs demonstrating more pronounced effects. PPI usage led to a significantly higher extent of oral-to-gut transmission and promoted the growth of specific oral microbes in the gut. This led to a significant increase in both the number and total abundance of oral species present in the gut, including the identification of known disease-associated species like Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus anginosus. Overall, gut microbiome-based machine learning classifiers could accurately distinguish PPI from non-PPI users, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.924, in contrast to an AUROC of 0.509 for H2RA versus non-H2RA users. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that PPIs have a greater impact on the gut microbiome and oral-to-gut transmission than H2RAs, shedding light on the mechanism underlying the higher risk of certain diseases associated with prolonged PPI use.

"Effects of Retrograde Colonic Enema-Based Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in the Treatment of Childhood Constipation: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Trial.","Gu X||Yang Z||Kou Y||Yang F||Wang Y||Chen Y||Wang E||Jiang X||Bai Y||Zhang Z||Zhang S","The American journal of gastroenterology","10.14309/ajg.0000000000002958","119","11","2024","INTRODUCTION: Management of intractable childhood constipation is still challenging. The efficacy of retrograde colonic enema (RCE) with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in intractable childhood constipation has not been established, although both have demonstrated potential in gastrointestinal diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of RCE-based FMT in the treatment of intractable constipation in children. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial with 110 children was conducted. The patients were randomly assigned to the FMT with RCE group or the placebo with RCE group. All participants received a daily RCE, followed by a 4-week FMT treatment (twice a week) and a 12-week follow-up period. Spontaneous bowel movements >/= 3 per week were the main outcomes, and the risk ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Changes in intestinal bacterial profile were analyzed by BOX-PCR-based DNA fingerprinting and sequencing. The adverse effects were assessed based on symptoms. RESULTS: At the end of the follow-up period, 22 patients (40.0%) in the FMT with RCE group and 10 patients (18.2%) in the placebo with RCE group had >/= 3 spontaneous bowel movements per week (net difference = 21.8%, 95% CI: 13.2%-30.4%; risk ratio: 1.364, 95% CI: 1.063-1.749; P < 0.05). Both RCE and FMT enriched the intestinal bacterial diversity of patients with constipation. The adverse events were all mild self-limiting gastrointestinal symptoms. DISCUSSION: FMT enhances the efficacy of RCE, and the use of RCE-based FMT is a safe and effective method in the treatment of intractable constipation in children."

A novel type 2 OPV (nOPV2) has been developed to be more genetically stable with similar tolerability and immunogenicity to that of Sabin type 2 vaccines to mitigate the risk of cVDPV2. We aimed to assess these aspects of nOPV2 in poliovirus vaccine-naive newborn infants. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, controlled, phase 2 trial we enrolled newborn infants at the Matlab Health Research Centre, Chandpur, Bangladesh. We included infants who were healthy and were a single birth after at least 37 weeks' gestation. Infants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either two doses of nOPV2 or placebo, administered at age 0-3 days and at 4 weeks. Exclusion criteria included receipt of rotavirus or any other poliovirus vaccine, any infection or illness at the time of enrolment (vomiting, diarrhoea, or intolerance to liquids), diagnosis or suspicion of any immunodeficiency disorder in the infant or a close family member, or any contraindication for venipuncture. The primary safety outcome was safety and tolerability after one and two doses of nOPV2, given 4 weeks apart in poliovirus vaccine-naive newborn infants and the primary immunogenicity outcome was the seroconversion rate for neutralising antibodies against type 2 poliovirus, measured 28 days after the first and second vaccinations with nOPV2. Study staff recorded solicited and unsolicited adverse events after each dose during daily home visits for 7 days. Poliovirus neutralising antibody responses were measured in sera drawn at birth and at age 4 weeks and 8 weeks. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04693286. FINDINGS: Between Sept 21, 2020, and Aug 16, 2021, we screened 334 newborn infants, of whom three (<1%) were found to be ineligible and one (<1%) was withdrawn by the parents; the remaining 330 (99%) infants were assigned to receive nOPV2 (n=220 [67%]) or placebo (n=110 [33%]). nOPV2 was well tolerated; 154 (70%) of 220 newborn infants in the nOPV2 group and 78 (71%) of 110 in the placebo group had solicited adverse events, which were all mild or moderate in severity. Severe unsolicited adverse events in 11 (5%) vaccine recipients and five (5%) placebo recipients were considered unrelated to vaccination. 306 (93%) of 330 infants had seroprotective maternal antibodies against type 2 poliovirus at birth, decreasing to 58 (56%) of 104 in the placebo group at 8 weeks. In the nOPV2 group 196 (90%) of 217 infants seroconverted by week 8 after two doses, when 214 (99%) had seroprotective antibodies. INTERPRETATION: nOPV2 was well tolerated and immunogenic in newborn infants, with two doses, at birth and 4 weeks, resulting in almost 99% of infants having protective neutralising antibodies.

We performed a longitudinal analysis on 172 samples from 28 infants at 8 post-birth time points and a cross-sectional analysis at 1 month in 79 infants from 3 cohorts. Although no significant associations with bacterial composition, metabolic pathways, short-chain fatty acids, and bile acids were found, we observed subtle differences between the groups at the bacterial strain level and in the load of antibiotic resistance genes. Rather, feeding mode was a predominant and defining factor impacting infant microbial composition. In conclusion, antibiotic administration during CS has only limited effects on the early-life gut microbiome."

Stored stool samples collected from cases of severe GE in the phase III trial were tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction using TaqMan Array Cards. Etiology was attributed by calculating the adjusted attributable fraction (AF) for each pathogen. A test-negative design was used to estimate VE. The pathogens with the highest AFs for severe diarrhea were rotavirus (23.5%), adenovirus 40/41 (17.0%), Shigella spp./enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, norovirus GII, enterotoxigenic E. coli, and Cryptosporidium spp. A considerable proportion of the disease in these children could not be explained by the pathogens tested. Severe GE cases associated with rotavirus and Shigella spp. were more likely to have a longer duration of vomiting and diarrhea, respectively. Cases attributed to Cryptosporidium spp. were more severe and required hospitalization. In the intention-to-treat population, VE was estimated to be 43.9% before and 46.5% after adjustment for co-infections; in the per-protocol population, VE was 46.7% before and 49.1% after adjustments. Rotavirus continued to be the leading cause of severe GE in this age group. The adjusted VE estimates obtained did not support co-infections as a major cause of lower vaccine performance in low- and middle-income countries."

Microbe","10.1016/j.lanmic.2024.100975","6","3","2025","BACKGROUND: Vonoprazan and amoxicillin (VA) dual therapy as a mainstream Helicobacter pylori regimen has gained momentum worldwide, but the optimum dosages remain unclear. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of VA dual therapy with 2 g amoxicillin or 3 g amoxicillin, and to assess the short-term effects of therapy on the gut microbiota and antibiotic resistome. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial at 12 centres in China. Individuals infected with H pylori, aged 18-70 years, and without previous eradication therapy were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio (block size of six) to receive vonoprazan (20 mg twice a day) with either low-dose amoxicillin (1 g twice a day; LVA therapy) or high-dose amoxicillin (1 g three times a day; HVA therapy) for 14 days. Gastric biopsies were collected before treatment for detection of antibiotic resistance. Stool samples were collected at baseline, week 2, and week 8-10 for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The primary outcome was the eradication rate of H pylori, assessed by (13)C urea breath test, in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Secondary outcomes were adverse events, adherence, antibiotic resistance, and alterations to the gut microbiota and antibiotic resistome. The margin used to establish non-inferiority was -0.10. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05649709. FINDINGS: Between Feb 13, 2023, and Jan 25, 2024, 504 patients (204 [40%] male and 300 [60%] female; mean age 43 years [SD 13]) were randomly assigned to LVA therapy or HVA therapy (n=252 in each group). No infections were resistant to amoxicillin. The H pylori eradication rate was 85.3% (215 of 252; 95% CI 80.4 to 89.2) in the LVA group and 86.5% (218 of 252; 81.7 to 90.2) in the HVA group in the intention-to-treat analysis (p=0.70) and 88.8% (213 of 240; 84.1 to 92.2) and 92.4% (218 of 236; 88.3 to 95.1), respectively, in the per-protocol analysis (p=0.18). The efficacy of LVA was non-inferior to HVA in the intention-to-treat analysis (risk difference -1.2%, 95% CI -7.3 to 4.9, p=0.0022) and the per-protocol analysis (-3.6%, -9.0 to 1.7, p=0.0085). 31 (12%) patients in the LVA group and 43 (17%) patients in the HVA group reported adverse events. Adherence to therapy was 97% in the LVA group and 96% in the HVA group. The diversity of gut microbiota decreased after treatment but was restored to baseline at week 8-10 in both groups. The abundance of beta-lactam-related resistance genes was increased at week 2 after treatment, and was restored to pretreatment level at week 8-10 for the LVA group but not the HVA group. INTERPRETATION: LVA dual therapy was effective and non-inferior to HVA dual therapy as first-line treatment of H pylori infection and showed a non-lasting effect on the abundance of beta-lactam-related resistance genes. High amoxicillin dosage (eg, 3 g per day) is not required to achieve high cure rates with vonoprazan dual therapy.

We conducted a large-scale 42-day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the effect of probiotics in alleviating CC. 163 patients diagnosed with CC (following Rome IV criteria) were randomly divided into probiotic (n = 78; received Lactiplantibacillus plantarum P9 [P9]; 1 x10(11) CFU/day) and placebo (n = 85; received placebo material) groups. Ingesting P9 significantly improved the weekly mean frequency of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) and spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs), while significantly reducing the level of worries and concerns (WO; P < 0.05). Comparing with the placebo group, P9 group was significantly enriched in potentially beneficial bacteria (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Ruminococcus_B gnavus), while depriving of several bacterial and phage taxa (Oscillospiraceae sp., Lachnospiraceae sp., and Herelleviridae; P < 0.05). Interesting significant correlations were also observed between some clinical parameters and subjects' gut microbiome, including: negative correlation between Oscillospiraceae sp. and SBMs; positive correlation between WO and Oscillospiraceae sp., Lachnospiraceae sp. Additionally, P9 group had significantly (P < 0.05) more predicted gut microbial bioactive potential involved in the metabolism of amino acids (L-asparagine, L-pipecolinic acid), short-/medium-chain fatty acids (valeric acid and caprylic acid). Furthermore, several metabolites (p-cresol, methylamine, trimethylamine) related to the intestinal barrier and transit decreased significantly after P9 administration (P < 0.05). In short, the constipation relief effect of P9 intervention was accompanied by desirable changes in the fecal metagenome and metabolome. Our findings support the notion of applying probiotics in managing CC."

Prednisolone therapy has shown modest survival benefits over placebo at 28 but not 90 days. Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) has shown promise in these patients. We compared the efficacy and safety of the two therapies in SAH patients. METHODS: Steroid eligible SAH patients were randomized in an open-label study to prednisolone (n = 60) 40 mg/day for 28 days (assessed at day-7 for continuation) or healthy donor FMT (n = 60) through naso-duodenal tube, daily for seven days. Primary outcome of study was day-90 survival. RESULTS: Patients in prednisolone and FMT arms were comparable at baseline (discriminant function score 65 +/- 16.2 and 68 +/- 14, MELD score 17.1 and 16.5, respectively). Of 120 patients, 112 [prednisolone-57; FMT-55] completed trial. As per intention-to-treat analysis, 90-day survival was achieved by 56.6% (34/60) patients in prednisolone and 75% (45/60) in FMT group (p = 0.044, FMT HR = 0.528, 95%CI 0.279-0.998). Secondary outcome of 28-day survival [78.33% (47/60) and 88.33% (53/60) (p = 0.243, FMT HR = 0.535, 95%CI 0.213-1.34)] with comparable severity scores over time between both arms. Infections accounted for 11 (19.3%) and 2 (3.6%) deaths in prednisolone and FMT groups, respectively (p = 0.01). Path-tracing showed a slow establishment of microbiota and alpha diversity (Shannon index) improvement by day-28 (p = 0.029). FMT resulted in 23 new taxa by day-28, reduction from baseline in pathogenic taxa [Campylobacter (19-fold, p = 0.035), anaerobes (Parcubacteria, Weisella and Leuconostocaceae)], and increase of Alphaproteobacteria [~ sevenfold, p = 0.047] and Thaumarcheota (known ammonia oxidizer, p = 0.06). Lachnospiraceae (p = 0.008), Prevotella and Viellonella communities in gut favored survival (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In severe alcoholic hepatitis, FMT is safe and improves 90-day survival and reduces infections by favorably modulating microbial communities. It can be a useful alternative to prednisolone therapy."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, and controlled, non-inferiority study. Patients (n = 194) enrolled from six centers were randomly divided into either the VA or EBAM group. H. pylori eradication was determined using (13) C urea breath tests (UBT) 4-6 weeks post-treatment. Fecal samples were collected, and gut microbial populations were analyzed by 16S rDNA and metagenomic sequencing technology. RESULTS: Eradication rates of H. pylori in the VA and EBAM groups were 88.7% and 91.8%, respectively, according to intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis; 95.6% and 96.7% with per-protocol (PP) analysis; and 94.5% and 96.7% with modified ITT (mITT) analysis (all p > 0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in the VA group was significantly lower compared to the EBAM group, and compliance within both groups was good. There was no difference in alpha-diversity or microbial composition in the VA and EBAM groups at one-month post-treatment compared to baseline, except for a markedly reduced abundance of Bacteroides in the EBAM group. CONCLUSION: VA therapy achieved excellent eradication rates with low adverse reactions, good compliance, and little impact on gut microbiota. VA therapy should be recommended as a first-line treatment against H. pylori."

However, whether therapeutic microbiota modulation prevents aGVHD is unknown. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of third-party fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) administered at the peak of microbiota injury in 100 patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving induction chemotherapy and alloHCT recipients. Despite improvements in microbiome diversity, expansion of commensals, and shrinkage of potential pathogens, aGVHD occurred more frequently after FMT than placebo. Although this unexpected finding could be explained by clinical differences between the two arms, we asked whether a microbiota explanation might be also present. To this end, we performed multi-omics analysis of preintervention and postintervention gut microbiome and serum metabolome. We found that postintervention expansion of Faecalibacterium, a commensal genus with gut-protective and anti-inflammatory properties under homeostatic conditions, predicted a higher risk for aGVHD. Faecalibacterium expansion occurred predominantly after FMT and was due to engraftment of unique donor taxa, suggesting that donor Faecalibacterium-derived antigens might have stimulated allogeneic immune cells. Faecalibacterium and ursodeoxycholic acid (an anti-inflammatory secondary bile acid) were negatively correlated, offering an alternative mechanistic explanation. In conclusion, we demonstrate context dependence of microbiota effects where a normally beneficial bacteria may become detrimental in disease. While FMT is a broad, community-level intervention, it may need precision engineering in ecologically complex settings where multiple perturbations (e.g., antibiotics, intestinal damage, alloimmunity) are concurrently in effect. SIGNIFICANCE: Post-FMT expansion of Faecalibacterium, associated with donor microbiota engraftment, predicted a higher risk for aGVHD in alloHCT recipients. Although Faecalibacterium is a commensal genus with gut-protective and anti-inflammatory properties under homeostatic conditions, our findings suggest that it may become pathogenic in the setting of FMT after alloHCT. Our results support a future trial with precision engineering of the FMT product used as GVHD prophylaxis after alloHCT."

The current aim was to evaluate rifaximin efficacy on individual and composite IBS-D symptoms using definitions not previously examined. METHODS: Phase III post hoc analyses of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and the open-label phase of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were conducted. Adults with IBS-D received a 2-week course of rifaximin 550 mg TID. Individual and composite responses for abdominal pain (mean weekly improvements from baseline of >/=30%, >/=40%, or >/=50%), bloating (mean weekly improvements from baseline of >/=1 or >/=2 points; or >/=30%, >/=40%, or >/=50%), stool consistency (mean weekly average stool consistency score <3 or <4), and urgency (improvement from baseline of >/=30% or >/=40% in percentage of days with urgency) for >/=2 of the first 4 weeks after treatment, and weekly for 12 weeks, were assessed. FINDINGS: Overall, 1258 patients from the double-blind trials (rifaximin [n = 624]; placebo [n = 634]) and 2438 from an open-label trial were analyzed. The percentage of bloating or urgency responders was significantly greater with double-blind rifaximin versus placebo (P </= 0.03). A significantly greater percentage of the double-blind group were composite abdominal pain and bloating responders versus placebo for all thresholds analyzed (P < 0.05). A significantly greater percentage of the double-blind group were tri-symptom composite end point responders (abdominal pain, bloating, and fecal urgency) versus placebo (P = 0.001). A significantly greater percentage of patients achieved response (>/=30% composite tri-symptom threshold) with double-blind rifaximin versus placebo as early as 1 week posttreatment, with significance maintained through >/=5 weeks after treatment. Open-label results were consistent with those of the double-blind study. IMPLICATIONS: Rifaximin significantly improved multiple, concurrent IBS-D symptoms, using clinically relevant definitions of treatment response. Using a novel tri-symptom composite end point (ie, abdominal pain, bloating, fecal urgency), adults with IBS-D treated with a 2-week course of rifaximin were significantly more likely to be composite end point responders than those receiving placebo (>/=30% or >/=40% threshold) for the three symptoms. Thus, rifaximin not only met current standard thresholds used for adjudication of responders in clinical trials but also achieved higher thresholds for many of these symptoms, suggesting potential for even more robust clinical improvements.

Approximately 5% of patients develop chronic antibiotic-dependent or antibiotic-refractory pouchitis without any effective treatment. The aim of this trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of chronic pouchitis. METHODS: This was a single-center, double-blinded, parallel group trial comparing donor fecal microbiota transplantation with placebo (autologous transplant) in chronic pouchitis. Twenty-six patients were recruited at the Helsinki University Hospital between December 2017 and August 2018 and were randomly allocated a 1:1 ratio to either donor fecal microbiota transplantation or placebo. The protocol included 2 transplantations into the pouch on weeks 0 and 4, and patients were followed up for 52 weeks. RESULTS: Nine patients in the intervention group and 8 patients in the placebo group relapsed during the 52-week follow-up, and the relapse-free survival did not differ between the groups (P = 0.183, log-rank; hazard ratio, 1.90 [95% confidence interval, 0.73-4.98; P = 0.190]).

We identified key indicators for poultry feces management and investigated their social determinants using data from a baseline survey of a randomized-controlled trial of a poultry management training program in rural Western Uganda. The baseline survey was conducted in the Masindi and Kiryandongo districts of Uganda in September 2019, and data collected from 609 households were used. We evaluated indicators for poultry feces management behaviors using scale development methods, including descriptive statistics, bivariate correlation analyses, and Factor Analysis of Mixed Data. We also investigated social determinants of key poultry feces management behaviors using logistic and multinomial logistic regression models. A significant increase in odds of having free-roaming poultry was found for each additional poultry owned (OR = 1.18, P < 0.001). The odds of a household having an observed enclosure for poultry increased by 5% with each incremental poultry owned (OR = 1.05, P < 0.001), and by 4% with increasing wealth with each additional point on the poverty probability index score (OR = 1.04, P < 0.001). Our results also suggest enclosures are intermittently used and constructing them without further intervention likely will not be sufficient for effectively managing animal fecal contamination. We recommend that future studies on animal feces management measure indicators for corralling and feces disposal practices and evaluate their relationship to enteric pathogen exposure and health outcomes. Insights from this work can inform the development of robust indicators of poultry feces management behaviors that can be used for monitoring and evaluation purposes."
"Effect of probiotic administration during pregnancy on the functional diversity of the gut microbiota in healthy pregnant women.","Ma G||Yan H||Tye KD||Tang X||Luo H||Li Z||Xiao X","Microbiology spectrum","10.1128/spectrum.00413-24","12","6","2024","Our study aims to investigate the impact of probiotic consumption during pregnancy on gut microbiota functional diversity in healthy pregnant women. Thirty-two pregnant women were randomly assigned to two groups. The probiotic group (PG) consisted of pregnant women who consumed triple viable Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus tablets from the 32nd week of pregnancy until delivery. The functional profiles of the gut microbiota were predicted through high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing results using PICRUSt software and referencing the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. In the gut microbiota of the PG, the genera Blautia and Ruminococcus, as well as the species Subdoligranulum, showed significantly higher relative abundances compared to the control group (CG) (P < 0.05). At Level 1 of the KEGG signaling pathways, there was a significant reduction in the functional genes of the gut microbiota involved in Organismal Systems in the PG (P < 0.05). In Level 2 of the KEGG signaling pathways, there was a significant reduction in the functional genes of the gut microbiota involved in Infectious Disease in the PG (P < 0.05). In Level 3 of the KEGG signaling pathways, the PG exhibited a significant increase in the functional genes of the gut microbiota involved in ABC transporters, Oxidative phosphorylation, Folate biosynthesis, and Biotin metabolism (P < 0.05). The CG showed a significant increase in the functional genes related to Cysteine and methionine metabolism, Vitamin B6 metabolism, Tuberculosis, and Vibrio cholerae pathogenic cycle (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our findings suggest that probiotic supplementation during pregnancy has a significant impact on functional metabolism in healthy pregnant women. IMPORTANCE: Probiotics are considered beneficial to human health. There is limited understanding of how probiotic consumption during pregnancy affects the functional diversity of the gut microbiota. The aim of our study is to investigate the impact of probiotic consumption during pregnancy on the functional diversity of the gut microbiota. Our findings suggest that probiotic supplementation during pregnancy has a significant impact on functional metabolism. This could potentially open up new avenues for preventing various pregnancy-related complications. This also provides new insights into the effects of probiotic consumption during pregnancy on the gut microbiota and offers a convenient method for exploring the potential mechanisms underlying the impact of probiotics on the gut microbiota of pregnant women."

METHODS: We investigated associations of biomarkers of tubular injury and inflammation with kidney structural features in 244 adults with type 1 diabetes from the Renin-Angiotensin System Study, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial testing effects of enalapril or losartan on changes in glomerular, tubulointerstitial, and vascular parameters from baseline to 5-year kidney biopsies. Biosamples at biopsy were assessed for kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNFR1), arginine-to-citrulline ratio in plasma, and uromodulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in urine. We examined cross-sectional correlations between biomarkers and biopsy features and baseline biomarker associations with 5-year changes in biopsy features. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 30 years (SD 10) and diabetes duration 11 years (SD 5); 53% were women. The mean GFR measured by iohexol disappearance was 128 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 19) and median urinary albumin excretion was 5 mu g/min (interquartile range, 3-8). KIM-1 was associated with most biopsy features: higher mesangial fractional volume (0.5% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.1 to 0.9] greater per SD KIM-1), glomerular basement membrane (GBM) width (14.2 nm [95% CI, 6.5 to 22.0] thicker), cortical interstitial fractional volume (1.1% [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.6] greater), fractional volume of cortical atrophic tubules (0.6% [95% CI, 0.2 to 0.9] greater), and arteriolar hyalinosis index (0.03 [95% CI, 0.1 to 0.05] higher). sTNFR1 was associated with higher mesangial fractional volume (0.9% [95% CI, 0.5 to 1.3] greater) and GBM width (12.5 nm [95% CI, 4.5 to 20.5] thicker) and lower GBM surface density (0.003 mu m 2 / mu m 3 [95% CI, 0.005 to 0.001] lesser). EGF and arginine-to-citrulline ratio correlated with severity of glomerular and tubulointerstitial features. Baseline sTNFR1, uromodulin, and EGF concentrations were associated with 5-year glomerular and tubulointerstitial feature progression. CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers of tubular injury and inflammation were associated with kidney structural parameters in early type 1 diabetes and may be indicators of kidney disease risk.

"Efficacy and safety of a synbiotic infant formula for the prevention of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections: a randomized controlled trial.","Piloquet H||Vrignaud B||Gillaizeau F||Capronnier O||Berding K||Gunther J||Hecht C||Regimbart C","The American journal of clinical nutrition","10.1016/j.ajcnut.2024.03.005","119","5","2024","BACKGROUND: Early life nutrition is crucial for the development of the gut microbiota that, in turn, plays an essential role in the maturation of the immune system and the prevention of infections. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether feeding synbiotic infants and follow-on formulas during the first year of life reduces the incidence rate (IR) of infectious diarrhea compared with standard formulas. Secondary endpoints included the IR of other infectious diseases as well as fecal milieu parameters. METHODS: In this double-blind, controlled trial, 460 healthy, 1-mo-old infants were randomly assigned to receive a synbiotic [galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS)/Limosilactobacillus fermentum CECT 5716] (IF, n = 230) or a control formula (CF, n = 230) until 12 mo of age. A reference group of breastfed infants (HM, n = 80) was included. Data on infections were recorded throughout the study period and stool samples were collected at 4 and 12 mo of age. RESULTS: IR of infectious diarrhea during the first year of life was 0.60 (CF), 0.56 (IF), and 0.29 (HM), with no statistically significant difference between groups. The IR of lower respiratory tract infections, 1 of the secondary endpoints, however, was lower in IF than in CF [0.79 compared with 1.01, IR ratio = 0.77 (0.60-1.00)]. Additionally, fecal pH was significantly lower at 4 mo (P < 0.0001), whereas secretory IgA was significantly higher at 12 mo of age (P = 0.015) in IF compared with CF. CONCLUSIONS: Although no difference is observed in the incidence of diarrhea, consumption of a synbiotic formula containing L. fermentum CECT5716 and GOS in infancy may reduce the incidence of lower respiratory tract infections and affect the immune system and fecal milieu. Additional research is warranted to further investigate the potential interaction of the gut-lung axis. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02221687."

We evaluated the efficacy of VOS compared with placebo in patients with comorbidities and other risk factors for rCDI. METHODS: Adults with rCDI were randomized to receive VOS or placebo (4 capsules daily for 3 days) following standard-of-care antibiotics. In this post hoc analysis, the rate of rCDI through week 8 was assessed in VOS-treated participants compared with placebo for subgroups including (i) Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score category (0, 1-2, 3-4, >/=5); (ii) baseline creatinine clearance (<30, 30-50, >50 to 80, or >80 mL/minute); (iii) number of CDI episodes, inclusive of the qualifying episode (3 and >/=4); (iv) exposure to non-CDI-targeted antibiotics after dosing; and (v) acid-suppressing medication use at baseline. RESULTS: Of 281 participants screened, 182 were randomized (59.9% female; mean age, 65.5 years). Comorbidities were common with a mean overall baseline age-adjusted CCI score of 4.1 (4.1 in the VOS arm and 4.2 in the placebo arm). Across all subgroups analyzed, VOS-treated participants had a lower relative risk of recurrence compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In this post hoc analysis, VOS reduced the risk of rCDI compared with placebo, regardless of baseline characteristics, concomitant medications, or comorbidities."

Although inactivated polio vaccines (IPV) effectively protect the recipient from clinical poliomyelitis, fecal shedding of live virus still occurs following infection with either wildtype or vaccine-derived strains of poliovirus. In the drive to eliminate the last cases of polio globally, improvements in both oral polio vaccines (OPV) (to prevent reversion to virulence) and injectable polio vaccines (to improve mucosal immunity and prevent viral shedding) are underway. The E. coli labile toxin with two or ""double"" attenuating mutations (dmLT) may boost immunologic responses to IPV, including at mucosal sites. We performed a double-blinded phase I controlled clinical trial to evaluate safety, tolerability, as well as systemic and mucosal immunogenicity of IPV adjuvanted with dmLT, given as a fractional (1/5th) dose intradermally (fIPV-dmLT). Twenty-nine volunteers with no past exposure to OPV were randomized to a single dose of fIPV-dmLT or fIPV alone. fIPV-dmLT was well tolerated, although three subjects had mild but persistent induration and hyperpigmentation at the injection site. A >/= 4-fold rise in serotype-specific neutralizing antibody (SNA) titers to all three serotypes was seen in 84% of subjects receiving fIPV-dmLT vs. 50% of volunteers receiving IPV alone. SNA titers were higher in the dmLT-adjuvanted group, but only differences in serotype 1 were significant. Mucosal immune responses, as measured by polio serotype specific fecal IgA were minimal in both groups and differences were not seen. fIPV-dmLT may offer a benefit over IPV alone. Beyond NAB responses protecting the individual, studies demonstrating the ability of fIPV-dmLT to prevent viral shedding are necessary. Studies employing controlled human infection models, using monovalent OPV post-vaccine are ongoing. Studies specifically in children may also be necessary and additional biomarkers of mucosal immune responses in this population are needed. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifer: NCT03922061."

Methods: Probiotic effects were evaluated at the beginning (T0), at four and eight weeks of treatment (T1 and T2, respectively), and after four weeks of follow-up from the end of treatment (T3) (n = 19) compared to the placebo group (n = 22). AR symptoms and quality of life were evaluated by the mini rhinitis quality of life questionnaire (MiniRQLQ) at each time point. Allergic immune response and fecal microbiota compositions were assessed at T0, T2, and T3. The study was registered on Clinical-Trial.gov (NCT05344352). Results: The probiotic group showed significant improvement in the MiniRQLQ score at T1, T2, and T3 vs. T0 (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, p < 0.01, respectively). At T2, the probiotic group showed an increase in Dorea, which can be negatively associated with allergic diseases, and Fusicatenibacter, an intestinal bacterial genus with anti-inflammatory properties (p-value FDR-corrected = 0.0074 and 0.013, respectively). Conversely, at T3 the placebo group showed an increase in Bacteroides and Ruminococcaceae unassigned, (p-value FDR-corrected = 0.033 and 0.023, respectively) which can be associated with allergies, while the probiotic group showed a significative increase in the Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio (p-value FDR-corrected = 0.023). Conclusions: This probiotic formulation improves symptoms and quality of life in subjects with AR, promoting a shift towards anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic bacterial species in the intestinal microbiota."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether bacterial load in drinking water is associated with altered risk of allergic diseases. METHODS: We recruited 1,110 schoolchildren aged 6-16 years between 2011 and 2013 in Pozega-Slavonia County in Croatia, where we capitalized on a natural experiment whereby individuals receive drinking water through public mains supply or individual wells. We obtained data on microbial content of drinking water for all participants; 585 children were randomly selected for more detailed assessments, including skin prick testing. Since water supply was highly correlated with rural residence, we compared clinical outcomes across four groups (Rural/Individual, Rural/Public, Urban/Individual and Urban/Public). For each child, we derived quantitative index of microbial exposure (bacterial load in the drinking water measured during the child's first year of life). RESULTS: Cumulative bacterial load in drinking water was higher (median [IQR]: 6390 [4190-9550] vs 0 [0-0]; P < .0001), and lifetime prevalence of allergic diseases was significantly lower among children with individual supply (5.5% vs 2.3%, P = .01; 14.4% vs 6.7%, P < .001; 25.2% vs 15.1%, P < .001; asthma, atopic dermatitis [AD] and rhinitis, respectively). Compared with the reference group (Urban/Public), there was a significant reduction in the risk of ever asthma, AD and rhinitis amongst rural children with individual supply: OR [95% CI]: 0.14 [0.03,0.67], P = .013; 0.20 [0.09,0.43], P < .001; 0.17 [0.10,0.32], P < .001. Protection was also observed in the Rural/Public group, but the effect was consistently highest among Rural/Individual children. In the quantitative analysis, the risk of allergic diseases decreased significantly with increasing bacterial load in drinking water in the first year of life (0.79 [0.70,0.88], P < .001; 0.90 [0.83,0.99], P = .025; 0.80 [0.74,0.86], P < .001; current wheeze, AD and rhinitis).

Here we provide support for the hypothesis that agricultural development and fertilizer use in West Africa increase the burden of the parasitic disease schistosomiasis by fuelling the growth of submerged aquatic vegetation that chokes out water access points and serves as habitat for freshwater snails that transmit Schistosoma parasites to more than 200 million people globally(8-10). In a cluster randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03187366) in which we removed invasive submerged vegetation from water points at 8 of 16 villages (that is, clusters), control sites had 1.46 times higher intestinal Schistosoma infection rates in schoolchildren and lower open water access than removal sites. Vegetation removal did not have any detectable long-term adverse effects on local water quality or freshwater biodiversity. In feeding trials, the removed vegetation was as effective as traditional livestock feed but 41 to 179 times cheaper and converting the vegetation to compost provided private crop production and total (public health plus crop production benefits) benefit-to-cost ratios as high as 4.0 and 8.8, respectively. Thus, the approach yielded an economic incentive-with important public health co-benefits-to maintain cleared waterways and return nutrients captured in aquatic plants back to agriculture with promise of breaking poverty-disease traps. To facilitate targeting and scaling of the intervention, we lay the foundation for using remote sensing technology to detect snail habitats. By offering a rare, profitable, win-win approach to addressing food and water access, poverty alleviation, infectious disease control and environmental sustainability, we hope to inspire the interdisciplinary search for planetary health solutions(11) to the many and formidable, co-dependent global grand challenges of the twenty-first century."

However, the effect of BQT and subsequent fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) on the gut microbiota is less known. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary hospital in China from January 2019 to October 2020, with the primary endpoints the effect of BQT on the gut microbiota and the effect of FMT on the gut microbiota after bismuth quadruple therapy eradication therapy. A 14-day BQT with amoxicillin and clarithromycin was administered to H. pylori-positive subjects, and after eradication therapy, patients received a one-time FMT or placebo treatment. We then collected stool samples to assess the effects of 14-day BQT and FMT on the gut microbiota. 16 s rDNA and metagenomic sequencing were used to analyze the structure and function of intestinal flora. We also used Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) to evaluate gastrointestinal symptom during treatment. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were recruited and 15 were assigned to either FMT or placebo groups. After eradication therapy, alpha-diversity was decreased in both groups. At the phylum level, the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes decreased, while Proteobacteria increased. At the genus level, the abundance of beneficial bacteria decreased, while pathogenic bacteria increased. Eradication therapy reduced some resistance genes abundance while increased the resistance genes abundance linked to Escherichia coli. While they all returned to baseline by Week 10. Besides, the difference was observed in Week 10 by the diarrhea score between two groups. Compared to Week 2, the GSRS total score and diarrhea score decreased in Week 3 only in FMT group. CONCLUSIONS: The balance of intestinal flora in patients can be considerably impacted by BQT in the short term, but it has reverted back to baseline by Week 10. FMT can alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms even if there was no evidence it promoted restoration of intestinal flora."

Its effects in healthy subjects has recently been studied, revealing its interaction with the gut microbiota. In this double-blind, randomized, cross-over, twice 3-week exploratory study, we investigated the impacts of CG on the cardiometabolic profile and gut microbiota composition and functions in 15 subjects at cardiometabolic risk. They consumed as a supplement 4.5 g of CG daily or maltodextrin as control. Before and after interventions, fasting and postprandial metabolic parameters and exhaled gases (hydrogen [H(2)] and methane [CH(4)]) were evaluated. Gut microbiota composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis), fecal concentrations of bile acids, long- and short-chain fatty acids (LCFA, SCFA), zonulin, calprotectin and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) were analyzed. Compared to control, CG supplementation increased exhaled H(2) following an enriched-fiber breakfast ingestion and decreased postprandial glycemia and triglyceridemia response to a standardized test meal challenge served at lunch. Of note, the decrease in postprandial glycemia was only observed in subjects with higher exhaled H(2), assessed upon lactulose breath test performed at inclusion. CG decreased a family belonging to Actinobacteria phylum and increased 3 bacterial taxa: Erysipelotrichaceae UCG.003, Ruminococcaceae UCG.005 and Eubacterium ventriosum group. Fecal metabolites, inflammatory and intestinal permeability markers did not differ between groups. In conclusion, we showed that CG supplementation modified the gut microbiota composition and improved postprandial glycemic response, an early determinant of cardiometabolic risk. Our results also suggest breath H(2) production as a non-invasive parameter of interest for predicting the effectiveness of dietary fiber intervention."

Probiotics is a promising intervention to improving intestinal dysbiosis. A double-blind clinical trial to investigate the ability of probiotics to modulate gut microbiota compositions in patients receiving hemodialysis (HD) was undertaken. METHODS: Fifty HD patients were enrolled and randomized, receiving either probiotics or placebo for 6 months. The responses to the interventions on gut microbiome, serum and fecal metabolome, serum albumin and endotoxin, endothelial activation markers and inflammatory markers were assessed. RESULTS: Totally, 22 in the probiotics group (11 males; 14 non-diabetic) and 23 in the placebo group (13 males; 17 non-diabetic) completed the study. Compared to that in the placebo group, probiotics did not significantly alter species diversity of the fecal microbiome. Probiotics did, however, restore the community composition, with particular significance in non-diabetic HD patients (P = 0.007 by Adonis analysis). Specifically, according to the results of linear discriminate analysis effect size, probiotics raised the proportions of family Bacteroidaceae and Enterococcaceae, and reduced Ruminococcaceae, Halomonadaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Clostridiales Family XIII. Incertae Sedis and Erysipelotrichaceae in non-diabetic HD patients. Additionally, probiotics reduced the abundances of several uremic retention solutes in serum or feces, including indole-3-acetic acid-O-glucuronide, 3-guanidinopropionic acid, and 1-methylinosine (P < 0.05). In the probiotic arm, no significant changes were observed in other secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, outcomes from this study suggest that probiotics do have benefits on improving intestinal imbalances and lowering exposure to several uremic toxins in HD patients."

Biomarkers were assayed using ELISA and Luminex. Associations between baseline values and all-cause 24-week mortality were analysed using Cox models, and for cause-specific mortality used Fine & Gray models, including prophylaxis randomisation, viral load, CD4, WHO stage, age, BMI, and site as covariates; and weighted according to inverse probability of selection into the substudy. Higher baseline CRP, IFN-gamma, IL-6 and IP-10 were associated with higher all-cause mortality; and higher IL-23, IL-2 and RANTES with lower all-cause mortality. Associations varied by cause of death: tuberculosis-associated mortality was most strongly associated with higher CRP and sST2, and cryptococcosis-associated mortality with higher IL-4 and lower IL-8.

After 12 weeks of treatment, the secondary endpoints were favorably differentiated in the synbiotic group when compared with the placebo group. Two patients in the synbiotic group reported transient adverse events (headache). The results indicate that treatment of IBS patients with the synbiotic significantly improved all major symptoms of IBS and was well-tolerated. The ClinicalTrials.gov registration was NCT05731232."
"Alteration of the Gut-Lung Axis After Severe COVID-19 Infection and Modulation Through Probiotics: A Randomized, Controlled Pilot Study.","Horvath A||Habisch H||Prietl B||Pfeifer V||Balazs I||Kovacs G||Foris V||John N||Kleinschek D||Feldbacher N||Gronbaek H||Moller HJ||Zukauskaite K||Madl T||Stadlbauer V","Nutrients","10.3390/nu16223840","16","22","2024","BACKGROUND: The gut-lung axis could be a potential therapeutic target for improving post-acute COVID-19 symptoms, and probiotics have been proposed as possible modulators. AIM: We conducted a pilot study to understand alterations in the gut-lung axis and to explore the effects of a probiotic in post-acute COVID-19 disease. METHODS: We included patients after severe COVID-19 disease (sCOV, n = 21) in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test the effect of a probiotic (Pro-Vi 5, Institute Allergosan, Graz, Austria) in a six-month intervention and used patients after mild disease (mCOV, n = 10) as controls, to compare the intestinal microbiome, metabolome, and patient-reported outcomes and biomarkers along the gut-lung axis at baseline and throughout probiotic intervention. RESULTS: Compared to mCOV patients, sCOV patients showed lower microbial richness, which was significantly improved by probiotic intervention. A reorganization of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae taxa was observed in sCOV patients but remained unaffected by the intervention. Serum metabolome showed a dysregulation of lipoproteins in accordance with higher BMI and comorbidities in sCOV patients. HDL and LDL fractions/components were temporarily decreased in the probiotic group. Stool metabolome was altered at baseline in sCOV patients and an increase in L-DOPA after 3 months and butyrate after 6 months of intervention could be observed. Probiotics partially improved reduced quality of life and modulated altered immune responses in sCOV patients. Increased intestinal permeability at baseline remained unaffected. CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence of long-term alterations of the gut-lung axis after severe COVID-19 infection and suggests that probiotics can modulate the biomarkers of the gut-lung axis."
"Fecal microbiota transplantation alleviates mild-moderate COVID-19 associated diarrhoea and depression symptoms: A prospective study of a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.","Jiang X||Gao X||Ding J||Pang B||Pei Y||Zhao Z||Zhao N||Wang Z||Chen C||Gao D||Yan F||Wang F||Liu C||Zhang Z||Li Z||Zhao Z","Journal of medical virology","10.1002/jmv.29812","96","8","2024","Currently, the emergence of the endemic Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation still poses a serious threat to public health. However, it remains elusive about the role of fecal microbiota transplantation in treating COVID-19. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolling a cohort of 40 COVID-19 patients with mild-moderate symptoms. Our results showed that fecal microbiota transplantation provided an amelioration in diarrhoea (p = 0.026) of digestive system and depression (p = 0.006) of neuropsychiatric-related symptom in COVID-19 patients, respectively. Meanwhile, we found that the number of patients with diarrhoea decreased from 19 to 0 on day 7 after fecal microbiota transplantation treatment, and it was statistically changed compared to the placebo group (p = 0.047). Of note, the serum concentration of aspartate aminotransferase-to-alanine aminotransferase ratio (AST/ALT, fecal microbiota transplantation, pre vs. post: 0.966 vs. 0.817), a biomarker for predicting long COVID-19, was significantly reduced by fecal microbiota transplantation. In all, our study supports that fecal microbiota transplantation could be a novel therapeutic strategy for COVID-19 patients with diarrhoea and depressive symptoms, which is potentially valuable in ameliorating long COVID-19 symptoms."
"Impact of probiotic supplements on behavioural and gastrointestinal symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder: A randomised controlled trial.","Narula Khanna H||Roy S||Shaikh A||Chhabra R||Uddin A","BMJ paediatrics open","10.1136/bmjpo-2024-003045","9","1","2025","OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether probiotic supplementation can improve behavioural and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 2-9 years and further explore the correlation between these symptoms. DESIGN: Single-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Five developmental paediatric outpatient clinics of 'Continua Kids'. PATIENTS: Children aged 2-9 years diagnosed with ASD along with their caregivers. INTERVENTIONS: Probiotic or placebo sachet reconstituted in 50 mL of lukewarm milk/water, taken two times per day for 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in behavioural (measured by Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2) and Aberrant Behaviour Checklist-2 (ABC-2) tools) and GI (measured by GI Severity Index (GSI) score) symptoms after receiving intervention for 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 180 children with ASD were enrolled in the study (probiotic group: 90 and placebo group: 90). All children completed the study. The probiotic group showed a significant reduction in behavioural symptom severity as measured by the SRS-2 tool (47.77% vs 23.33%; p=0.000) compared with the placebo. Probiotic-treated children demonstrated significant reductions in severe symptoms, including social withdrawal/lethargy (40%), stereotypic behaviour (37.77%), hyperactivity (34.44%) and inappropriate speech (32.22%) post-intervention (p=0.000). They also had marked improvements in constipation (p=0.003) and diarrhoea (p=0.043) compared with the placebo group. Both groups exhibited a statistically significant correlation between behavioural and GI symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic supplementation improved behavioural and GI symptoms in children with ASD with no adverse effects. Both symptoms were significantly correlated. However, these results need to be validated in a larger sample size. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CTRI/2021/11/038213."

Methods: This phase 2 trial had two parts: part 1, a 48-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of LUM/IVA in children aged 2-5 years (previously reported) was followed by a 48-week open-label treatment period in which all children received LUM/IVA (part 2; reported here). Endpoints assessed in part 2 included absolute changes from baseline in chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) global score at Week 96; weight-for-age, stature-for-age, and body mass index (BMI)-for-age z-scores at Week 96; lung clearance index based on lung volume turnover required to reach 2.5% of starting N2 concentration (LCI(2.5)) through Week 96; chest MRI morphological score, chest MRI perfusion score, weight, stature, BMI, and microbiology cultures (oropharyngeal swabs) at Week 96; sweat chloride, amount of immunoreactive trypsinogen, fecal elastase-1 concentration, and fecal calprotectin through Week 96; and number of pulmonary exacerbations, time to first pulmonary exacerbation, and number of CF-related hospitalizations. Results: Forty-nine children received one or more doses of LUM/IVA in the open-label period (33 in the LUM/IVA to LUM/IVA group and 16 in the placebo to LUM/IVA group), with a mean exposure of 47.1 (standard deviation [SD], 5.2) weeks. The mean absolute change in MRI global score (negative value indicates improvement) from baseline at Week 96 was -2.7 (SD, 7.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], -5.2 to -0.1) in the LUM/IVA to LUM/IVA group and -5.6 (SD, 6.9; 95% CI, -9.2 to -1.9) in the placebo to LUM/IVA group. Improvements in LCI(2.5), sweat chloride concentration, and markers of pancreatic function and intestinal inflammation were also observed in both groups. Growth parameters remained stable in both groups. The majority of children had adverse events considered mild (38.8%) or moderate (40.8%). Two (4.1%) children discontinued LUM/IVA treatment because of adverse events (distal intestinal obstruction syndrome [n = 1] and alanine aminotransferase increase [n = 1]). Conclusions: These findings confirm the potential for early LUM/IVA treatment to alter the trajectory of CF disease progression, including CF lung disease, in children as young as 2 years of age.

The Wells and Enteric disease Transmission trial is the first randomised controlled trial to estimate the burden of disease that can be attributed to the consumption of untreated private well water. To estimate the attributable incidence of gastrointestinal illness (GI) associated with private well water, we will test if the household treatment of well water by ultraviolet light (active UV device) versus sham (inactive UV device) decreases the incidence of GI in children under 5 years of age. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The trial will enrol (on a rolling basis) 908 families in Pennsylvania, USA, that rely on private wells and have a child 3 years old or younger. Participating families are randomised to either an active whole-house UV device or a sham device. During follow-up, families will respond to weekly text messages to report the presence of signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal or respiratory illness and will be directed to an illness questionnaire when signs/symptoms are present. These data will be used to compare the incidence of waterborne illness between the two study groups. A randomly selected subcohort submits untreated well water samples and biological specimens (stool and saliva) from the participating child in both the presence and absence of signs/symptoms. Samples are analysed for the presence of common waterborne pathogens (stool and water) or immunoconversion to these pathogens (saliva). ETHICS: Approval has been obtained from Temple University's Institutional Review Board (Protocol 25665). The results of the trial will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

The aim of the present investigation was to study the effects of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum HEAL9 and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei 8700:2 on the single-cell parasitome, with a primary focus on Blastocystis. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 78 Swedish children with celiac disease autoimmunity participating in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to either receive a mixture of supplementation with L. plantarum HEAL9 and L. paracasei 8700:2 (n = 38) or placebo (n = 40). A total of 227 stool samples collected at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of intervention, respectively, were retrospectively analyzed for Blastocystis by quantitative real-time PCR and subtyped by massively parallel amplicon sequencing. Other single-cell parasites were detected by untargeted 18S rDNA amplicon sequencing and verified by real-time PCR. The relation between the parasites and the bacteriome community was characterized by using 16S rDNA profiling of the V3-V4 region. RESULTS: Three different single-cell protists were identified, of which the highest prevalence was found for Dientamoeba fragilis (23.1%, 18/78 children), followed by Blastocystis (15.4%, 12/78) and Entamoeba spp. (2.6%, 2/78). The quantity of the protists was stable over time and not affected by probiotic intervention (P = 0.14 for Blastocystis, P = 0.10 for D. fragilis). The positivity of the protists was associated with increased bacteriome diversity (measured by multiple indices, P < 0.03). Bacterial composition was influenced by the presence of the protists: positivity of Blastocystis was inversely associated with Akkermansia (at the levels of the genus as well as its family, order, class and phylum); P < 0.002), Faecalibacterium (P = 0.003) and Romboutsia (P = 0.029); positivity of D. fragilis was inversely associated with families Enterobacteriaceae (P = 0.016) and Coriobacteriaceae (P = 0.022) and genera Flavonifractor (P < 0.001), Faecalibacterium (P = 0.009), Lachnoclostridium (P = 0.029), Ruminococcus (P < 0.001) and Granulicatella (P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of single-cell protists is low in children with celiac disease autoimmunity. The colonization was stable regardless of the probiotic intervention and associated with increased diversity of the fecal bacteriome but inversely associated with some beneficial bacteria."

Microbiota composition and deduced functions were profiled using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and predictive metagenomics, respectively. Probiotics were detected at day 5 of administration but otherwise had no discernable effects, whereas detection of bacterial infection (P<0.001) and participant age (P<0.001) had the largest effects on microbiota composition, microbial diversity, and deduced bacterial functions. Participants under 1 year had lower bacterial diversity than older aged pre-schoolers; compositional changes of individual bacterial taxa were associated with maturation of the gut microbiota. Advances in age were associated with differences in gut microbiota composition and deduced microbial functions, which have the potential to impact health later in life.

Gastroenterology & hepatology","10.1016/S2468-1253(21)00393-9","7","4","2022","BACKGROUND: Strictures are the most common structural complication of Crohn's disease. Surgery and endoscopic balloon dilation are the main treatments; drug therapy has been considered contraindicated. Given that most strictures have an inflammatory component, we aimed to find out whether strictures are responsive to drug treatment and whether intensive drug therapy is more effective than standard drug therapy. METHODS: This open-label, single-centre, randomised controlled trial was performed in one specialist inflammatory bowel disease centre in Australia. Patients aged 18 years or older with Crohn's disease were included. Eligible patients had a de novo or postoperative anastomotic intestinal stricture on MRI or ileocolonoscopy, symptoms consistent with chronic or subacute intestinal obstruction (postprandial abdominal pain in the presence of a confirmed stricture), and evidence of active intestinal inflammation. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive intensive high-dose adalimumab (160 mg adalimumab once per week for 4 weeks followed by 40 mg every 2 weeks, with escalation of dose at 4 months and 8 months if assessment of disease activity indicated active inflammation) plus thiopurine (initial dose of azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg or mercaptopurine 1.5 mg/kg, with dose adjustment based on thiopurine metabolite testing) or standard adalimumab monotherapy (160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, then 40 mg every 2 weeks) using stratified fixed block randomisation. Stratification factors were stricture dilation at study baseline colonoscopy and current biologic drug use. The primary endpoint was improvement (decrease) in the 14-day obstructive symptom score at 12 months by one or more points compared with baseline. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03220841, and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Sept 10, 2017, and Sept 6, 2019, 123 patients were screened and 77 randomly assigned to intensive adalimumab plus thiopurine treatment (n=52) or standard adalimumab treatment (n=25). At 12 months, improvement in obstructive symptom score was noted in 41 (79%) of 52 patients in the intensive treatment group and 16 (64%) of 25 in the standard treatment group (odds ratio [OR] 2.10 [95% CI 0.73-6.01]; p=0.17). Treatment failure occurred in five (10%) patients in the intensive treatment group versus seven (28%) in the standard treatment group (OR 0.27 [95% CI 0.08-0.97]; p=0.045); four patients in each group required stricture surgery (0.44 [0.10-1.92]; p=0.27). Crohn's Disease Activity Index was less than 150 in 36 (69%) patients in the intensive treatment group versus 15 (60%) in the standard treatment group (1.50 [0.56-4.05]; p=0.42). MRI at 12 months showed improvement using the stricture MaRIA score (>/=25%) in 31 (61%) of 51 versus seven (28%) of 25 patients (3.99 [1.41-11.26]; p=0.0091). MRI complete stricture resolution was seen in ten (20%) versus four (16%) patients (1.28 [0.36 to 4.57]; p=0.70). Intestinal ultrasound at 12 months showed improvement (>25%) in bowel wall thickness in 22 (51%) of 43 versus seven (33%) of 21 patients (2.10 [0.71 to 6.21]; p=0.18). Faecal calprotectin normalised in 32 (62%) versus 11 (44%) patients (2.04 [0.77-5.36]; p=0.15). Normalisation of CRP was seen in 32 (62%) versus 11 (44%) patients (2.04 [0.77-5.36]; p=0.15). Eight (15%) patients in the intensive treatment group and four (16%) in the standard treatment group reported serious adverse events. No deaths occurred during the study. INTERPRETATION: Crohn's disease strictures are responsive to drug treatment. Most patients had improved symptoms and stricture morphology. Treat-to-target therapy intensification resulted in less treatment failure, a reduction in stricture-associated inflammation, and greater improvement in stricture morphology, although these differences were not significantly different from standard therapy.

Less is known about the short- and long-term effects of FMT on larger panels of ARGs. We analyzed 226 pre- and post-treatment stool samples from a randomized placebo-controlled trial of FMT in 100 patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation or receiving anti-leukemia induction chemotherapy for 47 ARGs. These patients have heavy antibiotic exposure and a high incidence of colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms. Samples from each patient spanned a period of up to 9 months, allowing us to describe both short- and long-term effects of FMT on ARGs, while the randomized design allowed us to distinguish between spontaneous changes vs. FMT effect. We find an overall bimodal pattern. In the first phase (days to weeks after FMT), low-level transfer of ARGs largely associated with commensal healthy donor microbiota occurs. This phase is followed by long-term resistance to new ARGs as stable communities with colonization resistance are formed after FMT. The clinical implications of these findings are likely context-dependent and require further research. In the setting of cancer and intensive therapy, long-term ARG decolonization could translate into fewer downstream infections."

METHODS: In a non-inferiority, randomized clinical trial, H. pylori infected and treatment-naive patients were randomly assigned to receive 14 days of either vonoprazan dual (vonoprazan 20 mg and amoxicillin 1 g twice daily) or quadruple therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg + amoxicillin 1 g + furazolidone 100 mg + bismuth potassium citrate 600 mg twice daily). H. pylori status was confirmed using (13)C-urea breath tests or fecal antigen test. The primary outcome was the H. pylori eradication rate following vonoprazan dual and quadruple therapy at 4-12 weeks. We also compared drug compliance to either regimen and documented their side effect. RESULTS: A total of 190 subjects were randomized. The eradication rate of vonoprazan dual and quadruple therapy were 87.4% and 92.6% (p = 0.23) by intention-to-treat analysis, respectively, and 96.5% and 97.7% (p = 0.63) by per-protocol analysis, respectively.

UC standard regimen treatment has various side effects besides the efficacy, so there is an interest in administering complementary medicine to reduce adverse effects and increase the efficacy, as well. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and anti-inflammatory effect of Thymus kotschyanus as an additive treatment in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of UC patients. METHODS: Thirty UC out-patients with mesalazine regimen treatment that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were participated in a 12 week trial and were randomly chosen for the treatment and control group. Fifteen patients were administered a placebo as a control and 15 patients were received Thymus kotschyanus extract by a dose of 0.5 g in a day in the treatment group. Laboratory tests were performed at baseline and week 12. The primary outcome was a reduction in fecal calprotectin as the main intestine inflammatory marker. Likewise, reduction in SCCAI, SIDBQ, and SEO indices were considered as secondary aims. RESULTS: Fecal calprotectin was decreased by 54.74% in the treatment group, as compared with the placebo group at week 12 (p = 0.02). A significant reduction in SCCAI was also shown between the two study groups (p = 0.01). Thymus kotschyanus extract was safe and no severe side effects were reported.

A recent placebo-controlled clinical trial found a 39% reduction in UTI symptoms among recurrent UTI sufferers who consumed a daily cranberry beverage for 24 weeks. Using metagenomic sequencing of stool from a subset of these trial participants, we assessed the impact of cranberry consumption on the gut microbiota, a reservoir for UTI-causing pathogens such as Escherichia coli, which causes > 80% of UTIs. RESULTS: The overall taxonomic composition, community diversity, carriage of functional pathways and gene families, and relative abundances of the vast majority of observed bacterial taxa, including E. coli, were not changed significantly by cranberry consumption. However, one unnamed Flavonifractor species (OTU41), which represented </=1% of the overall metagenome, was significantly less abundant in cranberry consumers compared to placebo at trial completion. Given Flavonifractor's association with negative human health effects, we sought to determine OTU41 characteristic genes that may explain its differential abundance and/or relationship to key host functions. Using comparative genomic and metagenomic techniques, we identified genes in OTU41 related to transport and metabolism of various compounds, including tryptophan and cobalamin, which have been shown to play roles in host-microbe interactions. CONCLUSION: While our results indicated that cranberry juice consumption had little impact on global measures of the microbiome, we found one unnamed Flavonifractor species differed significantly between study arms. This suggests further studies are needed to assess the role of cranberry consumption and Flavonifractor in health and wellbeing in the context of recurrent UTI.

Samples were collected during eight quarterly visits approximately 1-3.5 years after intervention initiation. Overall, there were no substantial differences in environmental fecal contamination between households enrolled in the sanitation and control arms. Statistically significant reductions were found in stored water and child hands after pooling across sampling rounds, but the effects were small and not consistent across rounds. In addition, we assessed potential effect modification of intervention effects by follow-up time, season, wealth, community-level latrine density and coverage, population density, and domestic animal ownership. While the intervention had statistically significant effects within some subgroups, there were no consistent patterns of effect modification. Our findings support a growing consensus that on-site latrines are insufficient to prevent fecal contamination in the rural household environment."

Study participants were stratified by sex and block-randomised in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with either tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide (600 mg orally every 8 h) or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (500 mg amoxicillin and 125 mg clavulanic acid orally every 8 h). The study included 10 days of treatment (days 1-10) and four follow-up visits (days 14, 21, 90, and 180). The trial was open-label for clinical investigators and patients, but masked for microbiology investigators. Faecal samples were collected at all visits. Sequencing of 16S rDNA was used to measure the diversity metrics, and quantitative culture to quantify selected taxa. The primary outcomes were changes in the alpha and beta diversity and log count of colony-forming units for selected taxa between samples compared with baseline (day 1), and whether any changes reverted during the follow-up period. The analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04376554). FINDINGS: The study was conducted between Jan 23, 2020, and April 6, 2021. 49 volunteers were screened for eligibility, among whom 30 evaluable participants (14 men and 16 women) were assigned: 15 (50%) to the tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide group and 15 (50%) to the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid group. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Complete follow-up was available for all participants, and all participants except one completed treatment as assigned. The diversity metrics showed significant changes from baseline during the treatment period. Significant decreases in richness were observed on days 4-10 (p</=0.0011) in the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid group and on days 4-14 (p</=0.0019) in the tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide group. Similarly, evenness was significantly decreased during treatment in the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid group (day 4, p=0.030) and the tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide group (days 4-10, p<0.0001) compared with baseline. Quantitative cultures showed significant decreases in Enterobacterales (days 4-7, p</=0.0030), Enterococcus spp (days 4-14, p=0.025 to p<0.0001), Bifidobacterium spp (days 2-4, p</=0.026), and Bacteroides spp (days 4-10, p</=0.030) in the tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide group. Similarly, in amoxicillin-clavulanic acid recipients, significant changes were observed in Enterobacterales (days 4-10, p</=0.048), Bifidobacterium spp (days 2-4, p</=0.013), and Lactobacillus spp (days 2-4, p</=0.020). Samples from the follow-up period were not significantly different from those at baseline in beta diversity analysis (PERMANOVA, p>0.99). By the end of the study, no significant change was observed compared with baseline in either group. There were no deaths or severe adverse events. INTERPRETATION: The impact of tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide on the gut microbiome was similar to that of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. The safety of antibiotic use with regard to the microbiome should be given attention, as dysbiosis is associated with health and disease. FUNDING: Spero Therapeutics."

GalNAc conjugation targets the liver through the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR). This two-part phase 1 study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RO7062931 in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who were virologically suppressed. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Part 1 was a single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers randomized to receive a single RO7062931 dose (0.1-4.0 mg/kg), or placebo. Part 2 was a multiple ascending dose study in patients with CHB randomized to receive RO7062931 at 0.5, 1.5, or 3.0 mg/kg or placebo every month for a total of 2 doses (Part 2a) or RO7062931 at 3.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 3.0 mg/kg every week (QW), or 4.0 mg/kg QW or placebo for a total of 3-5 doses (Part 2b). Sixty healthy volunteers and 59 patients received RO7062931 or placebo. The majority of adverse events (AEs) reported were mild in intensity. Common AEs included self-limiting injection site reactions and influenza-like illness. Supradose-proportional increases in RO7062931 plasma exposure and urinary excretion occurred at doses >/=3.0 mg/kg. In patients with CHB, RO7062931 resulted in dose-dependent and time-dependent reduction in HBsAg versus placebo. The greatest HBsAg declines from baseline were achieved with the 3.0 mg/kg QW dose regimen (mean nadir ~0.5 log(10)  IU/mL) independent of HBeAg status. CONCLUSIONS: RO7062931 is safe and well tolerated at doses up to 4.0 mg/kg QW. Supradose-proportional exposure at doses of 3.0-4.0 mg/kg was indicative of partial saturation of the ASGPR-mediated liver uptake system. Dose-dependent declines in HBsAg demonstrated target engagement with RO7062931."

RV3-BB vaccine (G3P[6]) is based on a neonatal rotavirus strain that replicates well in the newborn gut in the presence of breast milk. This study investigated the association between maternal serum antibodies and vaccine response in infants administered the RV3-BB vaccine. Serum was collected antenatally from mothers of 561 infants enrolled in the RV3-BB Phase II study conducted in Blantyre, Malawi, and analysed for rotavirus-specific serum IgA and IgG antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Infant vaccine take was defined as cumulative IgA seroconversion (>/=3 fold increase) and/or stool vaccine shedding. Maternal IgA or IgG antibody titres did not have a negative impact on vaccine-like stool shedding at any timepoint. Maternal IgG (but not IgA) titres were associated with reduced take post dose 1 (p < 0.005) and 3 (p < 0.05) in the neonatal vaccine schedule group but not at study completion (week 18). In LMICs where high maternal antibodies are associated with low rotavirus vaccine efficacy, RV3-BB in a neonatal or infant vaccine schedule has the potential to provide protection against severe rotavirus disease."
"Stunting Status and Exposure to Infection and Inflammation in Early Life Shape Antibacterial Immune Cell Function Among Zimbabwean Children.","Mutasa K||Tome J||Rukobo S||Govha M||Mushayanembwa P||Matimba FS||Chiorera CK||Majo FD||Tavengwa NV||Mutasa B||Chasekwa B||Humphrey JH||Ntozini R||Prendergast AJ||Bourke CD","Frontiers in immunology","10.3389/fimmu.2022.899296","13",NA,"2022","BACKGROUND: Children who are stunted (length-for-age Z-score<-2) are at greater risk of infectious morbidity and mortality. Previous studies suggest that stunted children have elevated inflammatory biomarkers, but no studies have characterised their capacity to respond to new infections (i.e., their immune function). We hypothesised that antibacterial immune function would differ between stunted and non-stunted children and relate to their health and environment during early life. METHODS: We enrolled a cross-sectional cohort of 113 HIV-negative children nested within a longitudinal cluster-randomised controlled trial of household-level infant and young child feeding (IYCF) and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions in rural Zimbabwe (SHINE; Clinical trials registration: NCT01824940). Venous blood was collected at 18 months of age and cultured for 24 h without antigen or with bacterial antigens: heat-killed Salmonella typhimurium (HKST) or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TNFalpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, hepcidin, soluble (s)CD163, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and IFNbeta were quantified in culture supernatants by ELISA to determine antigen-specific immune function. The effect of stunting status and early-life exposures (anthropometry, inflammation at 18 months, maternal health during pregnancy, household WASH) on immune function was tested in logit and censored log-normal (tobit) regression models. RESULTS: Children who were stunted (n = 44) had higher proportions (86.4% vs. 65.2%; 88.6% vs. 73.4%) and concentrations of LPS-specific IL-6 (geometric mean difference (95% CI): 3.46 pg/mL (1.09, 10.80), p = 0.035) and IL-8 (3.52 pg/mL (1.20, 10.38), p = 0.022) than non-stunted children (n = 69). Bacterial antigen-specific pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations were associated with biomarkers of child enteropathy at 18 months and biomarkers of systemic inflammation and enteropathy in their mothers during pregnancy. Children exposed to the WASH intervention (n = 33) produced higher LPS- (GMD (95% CI): 10.48 pg/mL (1.84, 60.31), p = 0.008) and HKST-specific MPO (5.10 pg/mL (1.77, 14.88), p = 0.003) than children in the no WASH group (n = 80). There was no difference in antigen-specific immune function between the IYCF (n = 55) and no IYCF groups (n = 58). CONCLUSIONS: Antibacterial immune function among 18-month-old children in a low-income setting was shaped by their stunting status and prior exposure to maternal inflammation and household WASH. Heterogeneity in immune function due to adverse exposures in early life could plausibly contribute to infection susceptibility."
"Effects of Adding Lean Red Meat to a U.S.-Style Healthy Vegetarian Dietary Pattern on Gut Microbiota and Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Young Adults: a Crossover Randomized Controlled Trial.","Wang Y||Lindemann SR||Cross TL||Tang M||Clark CM||Campbell WW","The Journal of nutrition","10.1016/j.tjnut.2023.03.013","153","5","2023","BACKGROUND: Limited research evidence exists on the effects of red meat on gut microbiota in human adults. OBJECTIVE: We aim to assess the effects of consuming a Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern (HDP), without or with unprocessed or processed lean red meats, on gut microbiota and fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels in healthy young adults. Secondary outcomes are cardiovascular disease risk factors. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled, crossover trial with 3 3-wk dietary interventions, each separated by a 5-wk washout period with habitual dietary intake. Nineteen participants (8 females, age 26 +/- 4 y old, BMI 23 +/- 3 kg/m(2)) consumed 3 study diets in random order: 1) healthy lacto-ovo vegetarian diet (LOV); 2) LOV plus 3 ounces/d of cooked unprocessed lean red meat (URM); and 3) LOV plus 3 ounces/d of cooked processed lean red meat (PRM). Fecal and fasting blood samples were collected before and during the last 2 wk of each intervention. We measured fecal bacterial community structure using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing (V4 region, primers 515F-806R). Community diversity, structure, and taxonomic composition were computed using Mothur v.1.44.3. RESULTS: The addition of unprocessed or processed lean red meats to a LOV HDP did not influence short-term changes in bacterial taxonomic composition. Independent of red meat intake, the HDP led to changes in 23 bacteria; reductions in serum total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C concentrations; but no changes in fecal SCFA, serum triglycerides, HDL-C concentrations, TC/HDL-C ratio, or blood pressures. With data from all 3 diet interventions combined, changes in some bacteria were associated with improvements in TC, LDL-C, triglycerides, and HDL-C concentrations, and TC/HDL-C ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy young adults who adopt an HDP that may be vegetarian or omnivorous, including lean red meat, experience short-term changes in gut microbial composition, which associate with improvements in multiple lipid-related cardiovascular risk factors.

The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of summer acupoint application treatment (SAAT) on the abundance and biological structure of gut microbiota in healthy Asian adults. Based on the CONSORT guidelines, 72 healthy adults were included in this study, randomly divided into 2 groups, receiving either traditional (acupoint application within known relevant meridians, Group A) or sham (treated with placebo prepared by mixing the equal amount of starch and water, Group B) SAAT. SAAT stickers include extracts from Rhizoma Corydalis, Sinapis alba, Euphorbia kansui, Asari Herba, and the treatment group received 3 sessions of SAAT for 24 months, administered to BL13 (Feishu), BL17 (Geshu), BL20 (Pishu), and BL23 (Shenshu) acupoints. Fecal microbial analyses via ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing were performed on donor stool samples before and after 2 years of SAAT or placebo treatment to analyze the abundances, diversity, and structure of gut microbiota. No significant baseline differences were present between groups. At the phylum level, the baseline relative abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria was identified in fecal samples collected from each group. After treatment, the relative abundance of Firmicutes was significantly increased in both groups (P < .05). Notably, a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Fusobacteria was observed in the SAAT treatment group (P < .001), while the abundance of Bacteroidetes was decreased significantly in the placebo group (P < .05). At the genus level, the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium and Subdoligranulum species in the 2 groups were all significantly increased (P < .05). In addition, a significant reduction in the relative abundance of Blautia, Bacteroides, and Dorea in Group A (P < .05) and Eubacterium hallii group and Anaerostipes (P < .05) in Group B was observed after treatment. Our findings indicated SAAT substantially influenced the bacterial community structure in the gut microbiota of healthy Asian adults, which might serve as potential therapeutic targets for related diseases, and provided a foundation for future studies aimed at elucidating the microbial mechanisms underlying SAAT for the treatment of various conditions such as obesity, insulin resistance, irritable bowel syndrome."

In contrast, VE303 is a defined consortium of eight purified, clonal bacterial strains developed for prevention of rCDI. In the phase 2 CONSORTIUM study, high-dose VE303 was well tolerated and reduced the odds of rCDI by more than 80% compared to placebo. VE303 organisms robustly colonized the gut in the high-dose group and were among the top taxa associated with non-recurrence. Multi-omic modeling identified antibiotic history, baseline stool metabolites and serum cytokines as predictors of both on-study CDI recurrence and VE303 colonization. VE303 potentiated early recovery of the host microbiome and metabolites with increases in short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids and bile salt hydrolase genes after antibiotic treatment for CDI, which is considered important to prevent CDI recurrences. These results support the idea that VE303 promotes efficacy in rCDI through multiple mechanisms."

Although potatoes are suggested to adversely affect cardiometabolic health, controlled trials that can establish causality are limited. Consistent with potatoes being rich in micronutrients and resistant starch, we hypothesized that their inclusion in a Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)-based dietary pattern would improve cardiometabolic and gut health in metabolic syndrome (MetS) persons. In a randomized cross-over trial, MetS persons (n = 27; 32.5 +/- 1.3 year) consumed a DGA-based diet for 2 weeks containing potatoes (DGA + POTATO; 17.5 g/day resistant starch) or bagels (DGA + BAGEL; 0 g/day resistant starch) prior to completing oral glucose and gut permeability tests. Blood pressure, fasting glucose and insulin, and insulin resistance decreased (p < 0.05) from baseline regardless of treatment without any change in body mass. Oral glucose-induced changes in brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, nitric oxide homeostasis, and lipid peroxidation did not differ between treatment arms. Serum endotoxin AUC0-120 min and urinary lactulose/mannitol, but not urinary sucralose/erythritol, were lower in DGA + POTATO. Fecal microbiome showed limited between-treatment differences, but the proportion of acetate was higher in DGA + POTATO. Thus, short-term consumption of a DGA-based diet decreases cardiometabolic risk, and the incorporation of resistant starch-containing potatoes into a healthy diet reduces small intestinal permeability and postprandial endotoxemia."

However, the role of mycophenolate in the first-line treatment of adult-onset idiopathic minimal change disease (MCD) has not been systematically studied in a randomized fashion. AIM: To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium combined with low-dose corticosteroid as first-line treatment for MCNS. DESIGN: A prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial. METHODS: Twenty adult patients with biopsy proven MCD were recruited and randomly assigned to receive either enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium (EC-MPS) plus low-dose prednisolone (Group 1: Prednisolone 0.25 mg/kg/day, n = 10) or standard-dose prednisolone (Group 2: Prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day, n = 10). RESULTS: After 24 weeks of therapy, eight patients in Group 1 vs. seven of patients in Group 2 achieved complete remission (P = 0.606). Both groups showed a significant reduction of urine protein excretion (P < 0.05) and increased serum albumin (P < 0.001) vs. baseline levels. However, no significant between-group differences were demonstrated. The relapse rate was also similar in both groups. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated but there were more patient reported adverse effects in the standard-dose prednisolone group. CONCLUSION: EC-MPS plus low-dose prednisolone is non-inferior to standard-dose prednisolone therapy in inducing clinical remission and preventing relapse in adult-onset idiopathic MCD and is associated with better tolerability and less adverse effects.

Cancer patients and, among them, hematological patients are most vulnerable to these infections. Gut colonization by MRGNB is a common phenomenon occurring during hospitalization and chemotherapy exposure. In the neutropenic phase that occurs after chemotherapy, MRGNB translocation occurs increasing patient's mortality. Fluoroquinolone prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin efficacy is now being questioned due to the increase of incidence in MRGNB. METHODS: A phase III randomized, controlled, clinical trial, open-label parallel-group with a 1:1 ratio, aimed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of oral fosfomycin versus oral ciprofloxacin for febrile neutropenia prevention in patients with acute leukemia (AL) or hematopoietic cell transplant (HSC) receptors. Weekly surveillance cultures are planned to detect gut colonization. Changes in fecal microbiome at the beginning and end of prophylaxis will also be analyzed. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide evidence of the efficacy of an alternative drug to ciprofloxacin for febrile neutropenia prevention in high-risk hematological patients. The battery of planned microbiological studies will allow us to evaluate prospectively the microbiological safety of both pharmacological strategies in terms of the selection of MRGNB occurring in each arm. In addition, valuable information on the way in which each drug changes the fecal microbiome of the patients throughout the treatment will be generated.

SPR206 is a novel polymyxin derivative with potent in vitro and in vivo activity against A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and multiple clinically important species of Enterobacterales, including multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant strains. This was a first-in-human (FIH) double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-, and multiple-ascending-dose study of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of SPR206 in 94 healthy subjects. Following intravenous (i.v.) administration (1-h infusion) at single doses of 10 mg to 400 mg and multiple doses of 25 mg to 150 mg every 8 h (q8h) for 7 days and 100 mg q8h for 14 days, SPR206 was generally safe and generally well tolerated. While the incidence of adverse events increased with dose, most were of mild severity. Systemic exposure (maximum concentration of drug in serum [C(max)] and area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]) to SPR206 was approximately dose proportional, time to peak concentrations ranged from 1.1 to 1.3 h, and half-life ranged from 2.4 to 4.1 h. No appreciable accumulation occurred with repeated dosing of SPR206, and trough concentrations suggest that steady state was achieved by day 2. Urinary excretion of unchanged SPR206 was dose dependent across single- (SAD) and multiple-ascending-dose (MAD) cohorts, and the percentage of dose excreted as SPR206 was up to >50%. Importantly, no evidence of nephrotoxicity was observed over 14 days of 100 mg q8h dosing of SPR206; a dosing regimen anticipated to exceed requirements for clinical efficacy.

In-bed range of motion (ROM) exercise has effects on muscle strength, cardiac parameters and excretion. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of abdominal massage and in-bed ROM exercise on gastrointestinal complications and patient comfort in intensive care patients receiving enteral nutrition. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in the internal intensive care units of two tertiary public hospitals. The sample consisted of 130 patients randomly assigned to three groups (abdominal massage = 44, in-bed ROM exercise = 43, control = 43). The individuals received abdominal massage and in-bed ROM exercises every morning before enteral feeding for 3 days. We assessed gastrointestinal complications and comfort levels of the patients 24 h after each intervention. RESULTS: While the differences in abdominal distention, defecation status, constipation, and gastric residual volume complications were significant (p < .05), there was no significant difference in diarrhea and vomiting (p > .05). Comfort level showed a statistically significant change in the experimental groups in the in-group comparison (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Abdominal massage and in-bed ROM exercise reduce abdominal distention, constipation and gastric residual volume. Abdominal massage affects the frequency of defecation; and, both interventions increase the comfort while reducing the pain level over time."

There is emerging evidence that host engraftment of donor taxa is a tenet of successful FMT. We undertook a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study to characterize the response to FMT in children and young adults with mild to moderate active Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Subjects with CD or UC were randomized to receive antibiotics and weekly FMT or placebo in addition to baseline medications. We enrolled 15 subjects aged 14-29 years. Four subjects had CD, and 11 had UC. Subjects exhibited a wide range of microbial diversity and donor engraftment. Specifically, engraftment ranged from 26 to 90% at week 2 and 3-92% at 2 months. Consistent with the current literature, increases over time of both alpha diversity (p < 0.05) and donor engraftment (p < 0.05) correlated with improved clinical response. We discovered that the post-antibiotic but pre-FMT time point was rich in microbial correlates of eventual engraftment. Greater residual alpha diversity after antibiotic treatment was positively correlated with engraftment and subsequent clinical response. Interestingly, a transient rise in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus was also positively correlated with engraftment, a finding that we recapitulated with our analysis of another FMT trial."

Fatty acid desaturases (FADS) are putative new zinc status biomarkers. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to test the efficacy of zinc-biofortified rice (BFR) in preschool-aged children with zinc deficiency. Our hypothesis was that consumption of BFR would increase plasma zinc concentration (PZC). METHODS: We conducted a 9-mo, double-masked intervention trial in 12-36-mo-old rural Bangladeshi children, most of whom were zinc-deficient (PZC <70 microg/dL) and stunted (n = 520). The children were randomly assigned to receive either control rice (CR) or BFR provided in cooked portions to their households daily, with compliance monitoring. The primary outcome was PZC. Secondary outcomes were zinc deficiency, linear growth, infection-related morbidity, FADS activity indices, intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) and fecal calprotectin. We applied sparse serial sampling for midpoint measures and analyzed data by intention-to-treat using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: At baseline, median (IQR) PZC was 60.4 (56.3-64.3) microg/dL, 78.1% of children were zinc deficient, and 59.7% were stunted. Mean +/- SD daily zinc intakes from the CR and BFR during the trial were 1.20 +/- 0.34 and 2.22 +/- 0.47 mg/d, respectively (P < 0.001). There were no significant time-by-treatment effects on PZC, zinc deficiency prevalence, FADS activity, I-FABP, or fecal calprotectin (all P > 0.05). There was a time-treatment interaction for height-for-age z-scores (P < 0.001) favoring the BFR group. The morbidity longitudinal prevalence ratio was 1.08 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.12) comparing the BFR and CR groups, due to more upper respiratory tract illness in the BFR group. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of BFR for 9 mo providing  approximately 1 mg of additional zinc daily to Bangladeshi children did not significantly affect PZC, prevalence of zinc deficiency, or FADS activity.The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03079583."
"Environmental and behavioural exposure pathways associated with diarrhoea and enteric pathogen detection in 5-month-old, periurban Kenyan infants: a cross-sectional study.","Baker KK||Mumma JAO||Simiyu S||Sewell D||Tsai K||Anderson JD||MacDougall A||Dreibelbis R||Cumming O","BMJ open","10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059878","12","10","2022","OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test whether household environmental hygiene and behavioural conditions moderated associations between diarrhoea and enteric pathogen detection in infants 5 months of age in Kenya and pathogen sources, including latrine access, domestic animal co-habitation and public food sources. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study utilising enrolment survey data of households participating in the Safe Start cluster-randomised controlled trial . SETTING: Kisumu, Kenya. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 898 caregivers with 5-month (22 week +/- 1 week) aged infants were enrolled in the study and completed the enrolment survey. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were (1) caregiver-reported 7-day diarrhoea prevalence and (2) count of types of enteric viruses, bacteria and parasites in infant stool. Exposures and effect modifiers included water access and treatment, cohabitation with domestic animals, sanitation access, handwashing practices, supplemental feeding, access to refrigeration and flooring. RESULTS: Reported handwashing after handling animals (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=0.20; 95% CI=0.06 to 0.50) and before eating (aOR=0.44; 95% CI=0.26 to 0.73) were strongly associated with lower risk of caregiver-reported diarrhoea, while cohabitation with animals (aOR=1.54; 95% CI=1.01 to 2.34) living in a household with vinyl-covered dirt floors (aOR=0.60; 95% CI=0.45 to 0.87) were strongly associated with pathogen codetection in infants. Caregiver handwashing after child (p=0.02) or self-defecation (p=0.03) moderated the relationship between shared sanitation access and infant exposure to pathogens, specifically private latrine access was protective against pathogen exposure of infants in households, where caregivers washed hands after defecation. In the absence of handwashing, access to private sanitation posed no benefits over shared latrines for protecting infants from exposure. CONCLUSION: Our evidence highlights eliminating animal cohabitation and improving flooring, postdefecation and food-related handwashing, and safety and use of cow milk sources as interventions to prevent enteric pathogen exposure of young infants in Kenya.

"Safety and tolerability of frozen, capsulized autologous faecal microbiota transplantation. A randomized double blinded phase I clinical trial.","Stefansson M||Bladh O||Flink O||Skolling O||Ekre HP||Rombo L||Engstrand L||Ursing J","PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0292132","18","9","2023","BACKGROUND: Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is recommended treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection and is studied as a potential modifier of other gastrointestinal and systemic disorders. Autologous FMT limits the potential risks of donor transplant material and enables prophylactic treatment. Capsulized FMT is convenient and accessible, but safety data are lacking. AIMS: To describe safety and tolerability of capsules containing autologous FMT, compared to placebo, in healthy volunteers treated with antibiotics. METHOD: Healthy volunteers without antibiotic exposure during the past three months, that had a negative Clostridioides difficile stool sample, were recruited. Study persons donated faeces for production of capsules containing autologous microbiota. They were then given Clindamycin for seven days to disrupt the intestinal microbiota, which was followed by a two-day washout. Study persons were then randomized (1:1) to unsupervised treatment with autologous faecal matter or placebo, with two capsules twice daily for five days. A standardized questionnaire about side effects and tolerability, daily until day 28, and on days 60 and 180, was completed. RESULTS: Twenty-four study persons were included, all completed the treatment. One person from the placebo and FMT groups each, were lost to follow up from days 21 and 60, respectively. No study person experienced serious side effects, but severe fatigue was reported during the antibiotic period (n = 2). Reported side effects were mild to moderate and there were no significant differences between the groups. Reported general and intestinal health improved significantly and similarly in both groups after the antibiotic treatment. Time to normalized intestinal habits were 17 and 19 days from study start in the placebo group and the FMT group, respectively (p = 0.8). CONCLUSION: Capsulized frozen autologous faecal microbiota transplantation was safe and well tolerated but did not affect time to normalized intestinal habits compared to placebo.

This study assessed safety and efficacy of a probiotic in altering the intestinal milieu and mitigating gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) in endurance runners. In a double blind, crossover study, 16 runners were randomized to 4 weeks of daily supplementation with a probiotic cocktail containing Pediococcus acidilactici bacteria and Lactobacillus plantarum or placebo. Fasting blood and stool samples were collected for measurement of gut permeability markers, immune parameters, and microbiome analyses. Treadmill run tests were performed before and after treatment; participants ran at 65%-70% of VO(2max) at 27  degrees C for a maximum of 90 min or until fatigue/GIS developed. A blood sample was collected after the treadmill run test. In healthy individuals, 4 weeks of probiotic supplementation did not alter health parameters, although a marginal reduction in aspartate aminotransferase levels was observed with probiotic treatment only (p = 0.05). GIS, gut permeability-associated parameters (intestinal fatty acid binding protein, lipopolysaccharide binding protein, zonulin, and cytokines), and intestinal microbial content were not altered by the probiotic supplementation. Post-run measurements of GIS and gut-associated parameters did not differ between groups; however, the observed lack of differences is confounded by an absence of measurable functional outcome as GIS was not sufficiently induced during the run. Under the current study conditions, the probiotic was safe to use, and did not affect gut- or immune-associated parameters, or intestinal symptoms in a healthy population. The probiotic might reduce tissue damage, but more studies are warranted."
"The relationships between depression, inflammation and self-reported disease activity in IBD and their impact on healthcare usage.","Seaton N||Wileman V||Norton C||Hudson J||Mondelli V||Moss-Morris R","BMC gastroenterology","10.1186/s12876-025-03691-8","25","1","2025","BACKGROUND: Depression is common in people living with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Depression rates increase with active disease and are linked to poorer clinical outcomes. Previous studies investigating the relationship between contemporaneous IBD disease activity and depression are often poorly controlled, use small samples and/or rely on self-reported measures of disease activity. Depression and self-reported disease activity (SRDA) are linked to increased healthcare usage, however, objective inflammation is rarely statistically controlled. The primary aim was to understand how self-reported disease activity and inflammation are related to depression. Secondary aims included assessing the relative influence of self-reported disease activity, inflammation and depression on healthcare usage. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data collected as part of a randomised controlled trial (trial registration no: ISRCTN71618461) of a digital treatment for symptom self-management in IBD (n = 599). Bivariate associations of demographic and clinical variables with depression were conducted to identify relevant covariates. Multiple linear regressions assessed (i) the relationships between depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)), SRDA (IBD-Control) and intestinal inflammation (faecal calprotectin (FCP)) and (ii) whether these variables explained variance in healthcare usage and economic indicators. RESULTS: Depression was significantly predicted by SRDA (beta = -0.82, p < 0.001) but not FCP, with the model explaining 37% of the variance in depression (F(2,596) = 175.1, p < 0.001). FCP was only weakly associated with SRDA (r = -0.16, p < 0.001). Depression was independently associated with visits to primary care (beta = 0.19, p < 0.001), IBD secondary care (beta = 0.13, p < 0.001), IBD-related A&E attendance (beta = 0.10 p < 0.05) and the impact of IBD on productivity (beta = 0.24 p < 0.001) in the last 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Depression was related to SRDA but not FCP. Depression was also associated with healthcare usage even when SRDA and inflammation were statistically controlled. Routinely assessing and treating depression in IBD alongside managing inflammation may improve symptoms for patients and reduce healthcare costs."

We assessed the intestinal immunity in healthy adults in Belgium conferred by a co-formulation of IPV with the mucosal adjuvant double mutant Labile Toxin (dmLT) derived from Escherichia coli. METHODS: Healthy fully IPV-vaccinated 18-45-year-olds were randomly allocated to three groups: on Day 1 two groups received one full dose of IPV (n = 30) or IPV + dmLT (n = 30) in a blinded manner, and the third received an open-label dose of bivalent live oral polio vaccine (bOPV types 1 and 3, n = 20). All groups received a challenge dose of bOPV on Day 29. Participants reported solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AE) using study diaries. Mucosal immune responses were measured by fecal neutralization and IgA on Days 29 and 43, with fecal shedding of challenge viruses measured for 28 days. Humoral responses were measured by serum neutralizing antibody (NAb). RESULTS: Solicited and unsolicited AEs were mainly mild-to-moderate and transient in all groups, with no meaningful differences in rates between groups. Fecal shedding of challenge viruses in both IPV groups exceeded that of the bOPV group but was not different between IPV and IPV + dmLT groups. High serum NAb responses were observed in both IPV groups, alongside modest levels of fecal neutralization and IgA. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of dmLT to IPV administered intramuscularly neither affected humoral nor intestinal immunity nor decreased fecal virus shedding following bOPV challenge. The tolerability of the dose of dmLT used in this study may allow higher doses to be investigated for impact on mucosal immunity. Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT04232943."

The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of three monoclonal microbial formulations of L. lactis spp. cremoris (EDP1066) on the immune response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Potential effects on the gut microbiota were also investigated. METHODS: The trial was registered on Netherlands Trial Register (trial ID NL7519, https://trialsearch.who.int). Eighty-one healthy subjects (median 28, range 18-59 years) were randomized to 28 days of enteric-coated capsules at five doses (n = 13) (1.5 * 10(12) total cells daily), freeze-dried powder at one dose (n = 12) (3.0 * 10(11) total cells daily) or five doses (n = 12), minitablets at one dose (n = 12) or five doses (n = 12), or placebo (n = 20) prior to KLH immunization. Antibody responses and circulating regulatory T cells (Tregs) were measured after KLH immunization, and skin responses were evaluated after a KLH rechallenge by laser speckle contrast imaging and multispectral imaging. Ex vivo lymphocyte (phytohemagglutinin) and monocyte (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) cytokine release assays were explored in the minitablet-treated groups only. The prevalence of L. lactis spp. cremoris in the gastrointestinal tract and the impact on the fecal microbiota were assessed by qPCR and 16S rRNA sequencing, respectively. RESULTS: Repeated-measures analysis of covariances revealed no significant treatment effects on the antibody responses to KLH, number of Tregs, or KLH skin rechallenge outcomes. Ex vivo LPS-driven cytokine responses in whole blood were lower in the low dose minitablet group compared to placebo: tumor necrosis factor (estimated difference (ED) from placebo: -44.2%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -65.3% to -10.3%), interleukin (IL)-1beta (ED -41.4%, 95% CI -63.5% to -5.8%), and IL-6 (ED -39.2%, 95% CI -56.8% to -14.5%). The fecal presence of L. lactis spp. cremoris increased during treatment by all EDP1066 formulations and normalized 5 days after the last dose. Microbiome alpha-diversity did not change by the treatments compared to placebo. DISCUSSION: The EDP1066 formulations did not affect the immune response to KLH immunization in healthy individuals. However, exposure to L. lactis spp. cremoris in minitablet formulation impacted ex vivo whole blood LPS cytokine response. The clinical impact of these effects awaits further investigations.

Lactulose, as a prebiotic, has been widely used to improve gut health, yet its effect on AP is unclear. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized trial of moderate severe AP patients complicated with intestinal dysfunction. A total of 73 participants were randomly assigned to receive either lactulose or Chinese herb rhubarb for 1 week. The primary efficacy endpoint was the recovery of intestinal function. The serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and gut barrier indexes were examined. The fecal samples from patients before and after treatment were collected. 16 S rRNA gene sequencing analysis was performed to explore the composition of gut microbiota and the amount of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). RESULTS: The intestinal dysfunction was prominently improved after 7 days of treatment with either lactulose or rhubarb. The serum levels of cytokines and gut permeability index were decreased after treatment, with stronger down-regulated degree in lactulose group than rhubarb. The potential beneficial genus Bifidobacterium was enriched in lactulose group, while pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia-Shigella and Neisseria were abundant in rhubarb group. Of note, the level of SCFAs was remarkably increased after treatment, with higher amount in lactulose group than rhubarb group. CONCLUSIONS: Lactulose could not only restore intestinal function but also regulate gut microbiota and promote the production of SCFAs."

In this post hoc analysis of the phase 3 ECOSPOR III trial, we assessed impact of a microbiota-based oral therapeutic (fecal microbiota spores, live; VOWST Oral Spores [VOS], formerly SER-109]; Seres Therapeutics) compared with placebo, on AR gene (ARG) abundance in patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI). METHODS: Adults with rCDI were randomized to receive VOS or placebo orally for 3 days following standard-of-care antibiotics. ARG and taxonomic profiles were generated using whole metagenomic sequencing of stool at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 8, and 24 posttreatment. RESULTS: Baseline (n = 151) and serial posttreatment stool samples collected through 24 weeks (total N = 472) from 182 patients (59.9% female; mean age: 65.5 years) in ECOSPOR III as well as 68 stool samples obtained at a single time point from a healthy cohort were analyzed. Baseline ARG abundance was similar between arms and significantly elevated versus the healthy cohort. By week 1, there was a greater decline in ARG abundance in VOS versus placebo (P = .003) in association with marked decline of Proteobacteria and repletion of spore-forming Firmicutes, as compared with baseline. We observed abundance of Proteobacteria and non-spore-forming Firmicutes were associated with ARG abundance, while spore-forming Firmicutes abundance was negatively associated. CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept analysis suggests that microbiome remodeling with Firmicutes spores may be a potential novel approach to reduce ARG colonization in the gastrointestinal tract."

Co-primary endpoints included: i) proportion of patients in complete symptomatic and viral remission; ii) proportion progressing to moderate or severe disease with hospitalization, or death; and iii) days on Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Three hundred subjects were randomized (median age 37.0 years [range 18 to 60], 161 [53.7%] women, 126 [42.0%] having known metabolic risk factors), and 293 completed the study (97.7%). Complete remission was achieved by 78 of 147 (53.1%) in probiotic group compared to 41 of 146 (28.1%) in placebo (RR: 1.89 [95 CI 1.40-2.55]; P < .001), significant after multiplicity correction. No hospitalizations or deaths occurred during the study, precluding the assessment of remaining co-primary outcomes. Probiotic supplementation was well-tolerated and reduced nasopharyngeal viral load, lung infiltrates and duration of both digestive and non-digestive symptoms, compared to placebo. No significant compositional changes were detected in fecal microbiota between probiotic and placebo, but probiotic supplementation significantly increased specific IgM and IgG against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) compared to placebo. It is thus hypothesized this probiotic primarily acts by interacting with the host's immune system rather than changing colonic microbiota composition.

Older patients with C difficile infection are often frail and have comorbidities, leading to high mortality rates. The frailty burden in older people might restrict access to treatments, such as C difficile infection-specific antibiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation. We aimed to investigate the clinical effects of early comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and frailty evaluation, including home visits and assessment for faecal microbiota transplantation, in older patients with C difficile infection. METHODS: In this randomised, quality improvement trial with a pragmatic design, patients from the Central Denmark Region aged 70 years or older with a positive PCR test for C difficile toxin were randomly assigned (1:1) to CGA or standard care, both with equal access to faecal microbiota transplantation. Patients and investigators were unmasked to treatment. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality, and was compared in the study groups according to the intention-to-treat principle. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05447533. FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2022, and May 3, 2023, we randomly assigned 217 patients to CGA (n=109) or standard care (n=108). The median patient age was 78 years (IQR 74-84). 116 (53%) of 217 patients were female and 101 (47%) were male. 16 (15%; 95% CI 9-23) of 109 patients in the CGA group and 22 (20%; 14-29) of 108 patients in the standard-care group died within 90 days (odds ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.32-1.38. No serious adverse events or deaths related to patient assessment or faecal microbiota transplantation were recorded in either group. Deaths directly attributable to C difficile infection were lower in the CGA group (seven [44%] of 16 deaths vs 18 [82%] of 22 deaths in the standard-care group; p=0.020).

"Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial of Reloxaliase in Enteric Hyperoxaluria.","Lieske JC||Lingeman JE||Ferraro PM||Wyatt CM||Tosone C||Kausz AT||Knauf F","NEJM evidence","10.1056/EVIDoa2100053","1","7","2022","BACKGROUND: Enteric hyperoxaluria is caused by increased intestinal oxalate absorption and can lead to kidney stones, chronic kidney disease, and kidney failure. Reloxaliase is an orally administered recombinant enzyme that degrades oxalate along the gastrointestinal tract, thereby preventing its absorption. METHODS: We randomly assigned participants with enteric hyperoxaluria to reloxaliase or placebo, three to five times per day with food for 4 weeks. The primary end point was percent change from baseline in 24-hour urinary oxalate (UOx) excretion during weeks 1 to 4. Secondary end points included the proportion of participants with more than a 20% reduction in 24-hour UOx and an efficacy assessment in the bariatric surgery subgroup. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients underwent randomization. The 24-hour UOx decreased from a baseline geometric mean of 83.2 to 67.4 mg/24 hr during weeks 1 to 4 in reloxaliase-treated participants. Corresponding data for placebo-treated participants were 84.2 to 78.1 mg/24 hr. Estimates from the mixed-effect model repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis showed a 22.6% reduction in geometric mean UOx during weeks 1 to 4 for reloxaliase and 9.7% for placebo, a difference of 14.3 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.9 to 22.8; P=0.004). A 20% or greater reduction in 24-hour UOx was observed in 48.3% of reloxaliase-treated participants and 31.6% of placebo-treated participants (P=0.06). In the bariatric surgery subgroup, MMRM analysis showed a 21.2% reduction in geometric mean UOx for reloxaliase and a 6.0% reduction for placebo, for a difference of 16.2 percentage points (95% CI, 4.2% to 26.7%). Adverse events occurred in 69% of reloxaliase-treated participants versus 53% of individuals taking placebo and were most commonly gastrointestinal. All but one of the adverse events were grade 1 or 2 in severity; no reloxaliase-treated participants discontinued the study. CONCLUSIONS: Reloxaliase treatment for 4 weeks reduced UOx excretion in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria; adverse events were relatively common, but not dose-limiting. These data establish the foundation for a clinical trial to determine the impact of reloxaliase on nephrolithiasis in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria.

METHODS: A total of 108 infants with anemia, who were exclusively breast fed at 4 to 6 mo and weaned and formula fed at 6 to 9 mo, were recruited. The eligible infants were randomly assigned to fortified group 0 (FG0), fortified group 1 (FG1), or fortified group 2 (FG2) and were given formula fortified with 0 mg/100 g, 38 mg/100 g, and 76 mg/100 g of bLF, respectively, for 3 mo. The morbidity of diarrhea and respiratory tract infections (RTIs), the duration of respiratory and diarrhea-related illnesses, and the levels of fecal human beta-defensin 2 (HBD-2), cathelicidin LL-37 (LL-37), secretory IgA (sIgA), butyrate, and calprotectin were assessed. RESULTS: After the exclusion of 12 dropouts, the primary outcome measures, including episodes and duration of diarrhea and RTIs during the intervention, were obtained from 96 infants (35, 33, and 28 in FG0, FG1, and FG2, respectively). Compared with infants in FG0, there was a lower morbidity of rhinorrhea, wheezing, and skin rash among infants in FG1 (P < 0.05) and a lower morbidity of respiratory-related illness and wheezing among infants in FG2 (P < 0.05). Furthermore, a lower morbidity of diarrhea-related illness, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea was observed among infants in FG2 than those in the other two groups (P < 0.05). In addition, the FG1 infants had a lower morbidity of vomiting and nausea than the FG0 infants (P < 0.05). The HBD-2, LL-37, sIgA, and calprotectin levels were significantly higher whereas the butyrate level was significantly lower in the FG2 infants than in infants in the other two groups after 3 mo of intervention (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The bLF-fortified formula was effective in reducing the morbidity of diarrhea and RTIs in infants with anemia, with the 76 mg/100 g bLF-fortified formula exhibiting a stronger effect. The bLF fortification could be a new strategy for the prevention of diarrhea and RTIs in infants with anemia."

The primary outcome of the study was the number of patients with cleared VREfm colonization after the 4-week intervention. Secondary outcomes were clearance of VREfm colonization at weeks 8, 16, and 24, number of VREfm infections (isolated from nonintestinal foci), and changes in fecal microbiome diversity after the intervention. The trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in hospitalized adult VREfm carriers. Patients were enrolled and randomized to receive 60 billion CFU of LGG daily or placebo for 4 weeks. For a subgroup of patients, rectal swabs for VREfm were collected also at 8, 16, and 24 weeks and analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. Patients ingesting a minimum of 50% of the probiotic during the 4-week intervention were included in subsequent outcome analyses (48 of 81 patients). Twelve of 21 patients in the LGG group (57%) compared to 15 of 27 patients in the placebo group (56%) cleared their VREfm carriage. Eighteen patients completed the entire 24-week intervention with the same minimum compliancy. Of these, almost 90% in both groups cleared their VREfm carriage. We found a statistically significant difference between VREfm clearers and nonclearers regarding metronidazole and vancomycin usage as well as length of hospitalization after inclusion. The microbiome analyses revealed no significant difference in alpha diversity between the LGG and the placebo group. Beta diversity differed between the groups and the different time points. This study did not show an effect of LGG in eradication of VREfm after a 4-week intervention. IMPORTANCE Whereas other studies exploring the effect of L. rhamnosus in clearing VREfm from the intestine included children and adults, with a wider age range, our study consisted of a geriatric patient cohort. The natural clearance of VREfm in this study was almost 60% after 4 weeks, thus much higher than described previously. Also, this study characterizes the microbiome of VREfm patients in detail. This article showed no effect of the probiotic L. rhamnosus in clearing VREfm from the intestine of patients."
"Impact of Low-Cost Point-of-Use Water Treatment Technologies on Enteric Infections and Growth among Children in Limpopo, South Africa.","Hill CL||McCain K||Nyathi ME||Edokpayi JN||Kahler DM||Operario DJ||Taylor DDJ||Wright NC||Smith JA||Guerrant RL||Samie A||Dillingham RA||Bessong PO||Rogawski McQuade ET","The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","10.4269/ajtmh.20-0228","103","4","2020","Enteric infections early in life have been associated with poor linear growth among children in low-resource settings. Point-of-use water treatment technologies provide effective and low-cost solutions to reduce exposure to enteropathogens from drinking water, but it is unknown whether the use of these technologies translates to improvements in child growth. We conducted a community-based randomized controlled trial of two water treatment technologies to estimate their effects on child growth in Limpopo, South Africa. We randomized 404 households with a child younger than 3 years to receive a silver-impregnated ceramic water filter, a silver-impregnated ceramic tablet, a safe-storage water container alone, or no intervention, and these households were followed up quarterly for 2 years. We estimated the effects of the interventions on linear and ponderal growth, enteric infections assessed by quantitative molecular diagnostics, and diarrhea prevalence. The silver-impregnated ceramic water filters and tablets consistently achieved approximately 1.2 and 3 log reductions, respectively, in total coliform bacteria in drinking water samples. However, the filters and tablets were not associated with differences in height (height-for-age z-score differences compared with no intervention: 0.06, 95% CI: -0.29, 0.40, and 0.00, 95% CI: -0.35, 0.35, respectively). There were also no effects of the interventions on weight, diarrhea prevalence, or enteric infections. Despite their effectiveness in treating drinking water, the use of the silver-impregnated ceramic water filters and tablets did not reduce enteric infections or improve child growth. More transformative water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions that better prevent enteric infections are likely needed to improve long-term child growth outcomes."
"Different gut microbial communities correlate with efficacy of albendazole-ivermectin against soil-transmitted helminthiases.","Schneeberger PHH||Gueuning M||Welsche S||Hurlimann E||Dommann J||Haberli C||Frey JE||Sayasone S||Keiser J","Nature communications","10.1038/s41467-022-28658-1","13","1","2022","Soil-transmitted helminth infections represent a large burden with over a quarter of the world's population at risk. Low cure rates are observed with standard of care (albendazole); therefore, a more effective combination therapy (albendazole and ivermectin) is being investigated but showed variable treatment efficacies without evidence of intrinsic parasite resistance. Here, we analyzed the microbiome of Trichuris trichiura and hookworm-infected patients and found an association of different enterotypes with treatment efficacy. 80 T. trichiura-infected patients with hookworm co-infections from Pak-Khan, Laos, received either albendazole (n = 41) or albendazole and ivermectin combination therapy (n = 39). Pre-/post-treatment stool samples were collected to monitor treatment efficacy and microbial communities were profiled using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, qPCR, and shotgun sequencing. We identified three bacterial enterotypes and show that pre-treatment enterotype is associated with efficacy of the combination treatment for both T. trichiura (CR(ET1) = 5.8%; CR(ET2) = 16.6%; CR(ET3) = 68.8%) and hookworm (CR(ET1) = 31.3%; CR(ET2) = 16.6%; CR(ET3) = 78.6%).

The gut microbiota of human virus immunodeficiency (HIV)-infected children remains barely explored. We aimed to characterize the fecal microbiota in vertically HIV-infected children and to explore the effects of its modulation with a symbiotic nutritional intervention. METHODS: a pilot, double blind, randomized placebo-controlled study including HIV-infected children who were randomized to receive a nutritional supplementation including prebiotics and probiotics or placebo for four weeks. HIV-uninfected siblings were recruited as controls. The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced in fecal samples. RESULTS: 22 HIV-infected children on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and with viral load (VL) <50/mL completed the follow-up period. Mean age was 11.4 +/- 3.4 years, eight (32%) were male. Their microbiota showed reduced alpha diversity compared to controls and distinct beta diversity at the genus level (Adonis p = 0.042). Patients showed decreased abundance of commensals Faecalibacterium and an increase in Prevotella, Akkermansia and Escherichia. The nutritional intervention shaped the microbiota towards the control group, without a clear directionality. CONCLUSIONS: Vertical HIV infection is characterized by changes in gut microbiota structure, distinct at the compositional level from the findings reported in adults. A short nutritional intervention attenuated bacterial dysbiosis, without clear changes at the community level. SUMMARY: In a group of 24 vertically HIV-infected children, in comparison to 11 uninfected controls, intestinal dysbiosis was observed despite effective ART. Although not fully effective to restore the microbiota, a short intervention with pre/probiotics attenuated bacterial dysbiosis."

Few data with adequate evidence exists as regards the effect of Cyclosporine (CsA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on pathological prognostic parameters in patients with steroid resistant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The purpose of the present study is to compare the effect of cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil in addition to steroids on functional and histopathologic renal parameters in patients with steroid resistant FSGS one year after treatment.Material and methods. Thirty-seven adults with primary FSGS patients resistant to steroid therapy consecutively randomized to treatment with either MMF or cyclosporine. Low dose prednisolone added to both groups. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and blood pressure (BP) were determined at all examinations and a second renal biopsy was taken 12 months after treatment with either of cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil.Results. GFR significantly increased in MMF group p < 0.01 after 6 months and unchanged after 12 months. On the other hand, GFR significantly decrease in CsA group p < 0.001 after 6 months and reduced more after 12 months p < 0.001 compared to base line levels. There was a significant difference of GFR between the 2 groups at 6 months p < 0.001. The extent of proteinuria decreased significantly in CsA group after 12 months p < 0.001. The extent of arteriolar hyalinosis increased significantly in CsA group (0.78 to 1.81 score, p < 0.001) but was unchanged in MMF group (0.93 to 0.96 score), whereas interstitial fibrosis increased to same level in both groups (grade 3).Conclusion. Conversion to MMF in those patients may be superior to CsA as regards GFR after 12 months after treatment in spite of the presence of greater level of protein excretion. The increased arteriolar hyalinosis during CsA treatment most likely results in higher BP compared to MMF treatment in patients with FSGS resistant to steroids."
"Impact of wheat aleurone on biomarkers of cardiovascular disease, gut microbiota and metabolites in adults with high body mass index: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.","Fava F||Ulaszewska MM||Scholz M||Stanstrup J||Nissen L||Mattivi F||Vermeiren J||Bosscher D||Pedrolli C||Tuohy KM","European journal of nutrition","10.1007/s00394-022-02836-9","61","5","2022","PURPOSE: Aleurone is a cereal bran fraction containing a variety of beneficial nutrients including polyphenols, fibers, minerals and vitamins. Animal and human studies support the beneficial role of aleurone consumption in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Gut microbiota fiber fermentation, polyphenol metabolism and betaine/choline metabolism may in part contribute to the physiological effects of aleurone. As primary objective, this study evaluated whether wheat aleurone supplemented foods could modify plasma homocysteine. Secondary objectives included changes in CVD biomarkers, fecal microbiota composition and plasma/urine metabolite profiles. METHODS: A parallel double-blind, placebo-controlled and randomized trial was carried out in two groups of obese/overweight subjects, matched for age, BMI and gender, consuming foods supplemented with either aleurone (27 g/day) (AL, n = 34) or cellulose (placebo treatment, PL, n = 33) for 4 weeks. RESULTS: No significant changes in plasma homocysteine or other clinical markers were observed with either treatment. Dietary fiber intake increased after AL and PL, animal protein intake increased after PL treatment. We observed a significant increase in fecal Bifidobacterium spp with AL and Lactobacillus spp with both AL and PL, but overall fecal microbiota community structure changed little according to 16S rRNA metataxonomics. Metabolomics implicated microbial metabolism of aleurone polyphenols and revealed distinctive biomarkers of AL treatment, including alkylresorcinol, cinnamic, benzoic and ferulic acids, folic acid, fatty acids, benzoxazinoid and roasted aroma related metabolites. Correlation analysis highlighted bacterial genera potentially linked to urinary compounds derived from aleurone metabolism and clinical parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Aleurone has potential to modulate the gut microbial metabolic output and increase fecal bifidobacterial abundance. However, in this study, aleurone did not impact on plasma homocysteine or other CVD biomarkers.

Given the acknowledged probiotic properties of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 100 fracture patients with post-surgery constipation were centrally enrolled and administered orally with L. rhamnosus JYLR-127 to assess the efficacy of probiotic-adjuvant therapy in alleviating post-fracture constipation symptoms. The results showed that L. rhamnosus JYLR-127 improved fecal properties, promoted gastrointestinal recovery, and relieved constipation symptoms, which were mainly achieved by elevating Firmicutes (p < 0.01) and descending Bacteroidetes (p < 0.001), hence remodeling the disrupted intestinal microecology. In addition, blood routine presented a decrease in C-reactive protein levels (p < 0.05) and an increase in platelet counts (p < 0.05) after probiotic supplementation, prompting the feasibility of L. rhamnosus JYLR-127 in anti-inflammation, anti-infection and hemorrhagic tendency prevention after fracture surgery. Our study to apply probiotics in ameliorating constipation after fracture surgery is expected to bless the bothered patients, and provide broader application scenarios for L. rhamnosus preparations."

In developing countries, systemic therapies are not usually successful due to elevated antibiotic resistance. Additionally, oral H. pylori infection and periodontal disease correlate with gastric treatment failures. This study aimed to explore the effect of an integral therapy, comprising oral hygiene and concomitant systemic treatment, to increase the eradication of gastric infection and recurrences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, randomized, four-arm, parallel-group, open-label clinical trial was conducted to investigate the efficacy of integral therapy to eradicate gastric H. pylori infection and avoid recurrences in double-positive (real-time PCR oral and gastric infection) patients. Oral hygiene involved mouthwash with neutral electrolyzed water (NEW), with or without periodontal treatment. One hundred patients were equally distributed into four groups: NS, NS-PT, NEW, and NEW-PT. All patients had concomitant systemic therapy and additionally, the following oral treatments: mouthwash with normal saline (NS), periodontal treatment and mouthwash with normal saline (NS-PT), mouthwash with NEW (NEW), and periodontal treatment and mouthwash with NEW (NEW-PT). Gastric and oral infection and symptoms were evaluated one and four months after treatments. RESULTS: Integral therapy with NEW-PT increased gastric eradication rates compared with NS or NS-PT (84%-96% vs. 20%-56%; p < 0.001). Even more, a protective effect of 81.2% (RR = 0.1877; 95% CI: 0.0658-0.5355; p = 0.0018) against recurrences and 76.6% (RR = 0.2439; 95% CI: 0.1380-0.4310; p < 0.001) against treatment failure (eradication of infection and associated symptoms) was observed in patients from the NEW and NEW-PT groups. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of oral hygiene and systemic treatment can increase the eradication of gastric infection, associated symptoms, and recurrences. NEW is recommended as an antiseptic mouthwash due to its efficacy and short- and long-term safety."

STUDY DESIGN: By analyzing 1468 expecting biological parent pairs for HLA-conferred susceptibility for type 1 diabetes, 465 couples (32 %) potentially eligible for the study were identified. After further parental consent, 332 babies to be born were randomized at 35th gestational week. HLA genotyping was performed at birth in 309 infants. Out of 87 eligible children, 73 infants participated in the intervention study: 33 in the EHF group and 40 in the control group. Clinical visits took place at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age. The infants were provided either EHF or conventional formula whenever breastfeeding was not available or additional feeding was required over the first 9 months of life. The main outcome was the lactulose to mannitol ratio (L/M ratio) at 9 months. The secondary outcomes were L/M ratio at 3, 6, and 12 months of age, and fecal calprotectin and human beta-defensin 2 (HBD-2) levels at each visit. RESULTS: Compared with controls, the median L/M ratio was lower in the EHF group at 9 months (.006 vs .028; P = .005). Otherwise, the levels of intestinal permeability, fecal calprotectin, and HBD-2 were comparable between the two groups, although slight differences in the age-related dynamics of these markers were observed. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to decrease intestinal permeability in infancy through weaning to an extensively hydrolyzed formula. This may reduce the early exposure to dietary antigens.

We aimed to assess clinical outcomes of increased adalimumab dose intervals versus conventional dosing in patients with Crohn's disease in stable remission. METHODS: The LADI study was a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority, parallel, randomised controlled trial, done in six academic hospitals and 14 general hospitals in the Netherlands. Adults (aged >/=18 years) diagnosed with luminal Crohn's disease (with or without concomitant perianal disease) were eligible when in steroid-free clinical and biochemical remission (defined as Harvey-Bradshaw Index [HBI] score <5, faecal calprotectin <150 mug/g, and C-reactive protein <10 mg/L) for at least 9 months on a stable dose of 40 mg subcutaneous adalimumab every 2 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to the intervention group or control group by the coordinating investigator using a secure web-based system with variable block randomisation (block sizes of 6, 9, and 12). Randomisation was stratified on concomitant use of thiopurines and methotrexate. Patients and health-care providers were not masked to group assignment. Patients allocated to the intervention group increased adalimumab dose intervals to 40 mg every 3 weeks at baseline and further to every 4 weeks if they remained in clinical and biochemical remission at week 24. Patients in the control group continued their 2-weekly dose interval. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of persistent flares at week 48 defined as the presence of at least two of the following criteria: HBI score of 5 or more, C-reactive protein 10 mg/L or more, and faecal calprotectin more than 250 mug/g for more than 8 weeks and a concurrent decrease in the adalimumab dose interval or start of escape medication. The non-inferiority margin was 15% on a risk difference scale. All analyses were done in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03172377, and is not recruiting. FINDINGS: Between May 3, 2017, and July 6, 2020, 174 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n=113) or the control group (n=61). Four patients from the intervention group and one patient from the control group were excluded from the analysis for not meeting inclusion criteria. 85 (50%) of 169 participants were female and 84 (50%) were male. At week 48, the cumulative incidence of persistent flares in the intervention group (three [3%] of 109) was non-inferior compared with the control group (zero; pooled adjusted risk difference 1.86% [90% CI -0.35 to 4.07). Seven serious adverse events occurred, all in the intervention group, of which two (both patients with intestinal obstruction) were possibly related to the intervention. Per 100 person-years, 168.35 total adverse events, 59.99 infection-related adverse events, and 42.57 gastrointestinal adverse events occurred in the intervention group versus 134.67, 75.03, and 5.77 in the control group, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The individual benefit of increasing adalimumab dose intervals versus the risk of disease recurrence is a trade-off that should take patient preferences regarding medication and the risk of a flare into account.

To interrogate this discrepancy, we measured the enteric infections from this study. METHODS: We leveraged the Early Life Interventions for Childhood Growth and Development in Tanzania (ELICIT) trial, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of antimicrobial therapy with azithromycin and nitazoxanide provided quarterly to infants from 6 to 15 months of age. We tested 5,479 stool samples at time points across the study for 34 enteropathogens using quantitative PCR. RESULTS: There was substantial carriage of enteropathogens in stool. Azithromycin administration led to reductions in Campylobacter jejuni/coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, and Shigella/EIEC (absolute risk difference ranged from -0.06 to 0.24) 2 weeks after treatment however there was no effect after 3 months. There was no difference in Giardia after nitazoxanide administration (ARR 0.03 at the 12 month administration). When examining the effect of azithromycin versus placebo on the subset of children infected with specific pathogens at the time of treatment, a small increase in weight-for-age Z score was seen only in those infected with Campylobacter jejuni/coli (0.10 Z score, 95% CI -0.01-0.20; length-for-age Z score 0.07, 95% CI -0.06-0.20). CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial intervention of quarterly azithromycin plus or minus nitazoxanide led to only transient decreases in enteric infections with Shigella/EIEC, enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), Campylobacter, and Giardia. There was a trend towards improved growth in children infected with Campylobacter that received quarterly azithromycin."

Up to 15-20% of children infected by high-risk STEC (i.e., E. coli that produce Shiga toxin 2) develop hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney failure (i.e., hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)), over half of whom require acute dialysis and 3% die. Although no therapy is widely accepted as being able to prevent the development of HUS and its complications, several observational studies suggest that intravascular volume expansion (hyperhydration) may prevent end organ damage. A randomized trial is needed to confirm or refute this hypothesis. METHODS: We will conduct a pragmatic, embedded, cluster-randomized, crossover trial in 26 pediatric institutions to determine if hyperhydration, compared to conservative fluid management, improves outcomes in 1040 children with high-risk STEC infections. The primary outcome is major adverse kidney events within 30 days (MAKE30), a composite measure that includes death, initiation of new renal replacement therapy, or persistent kidney dysfunction. Secondary outcomes include life-threatening, extrarenal complications, and development of HUS. Pathway eligible children will be treated per institutional allocation to each pathway. In the hyperhydration pathway, all eligible children are hospitalized and administered 200% maintenance balanced crystalloid fluids up to targets of 10% weight gain and 20% reduction in hematocrit. Sites in the conservative fluid management pathway manage children as in- or outpatients, based on clinician preference, with the pathway focused on close laboratory monitoring, and maintenance of euvolemia. Based on historical data, we estimate that 10% of children in our conservative fluid management pathway will experience the primary outcome. With 26 clusters enrolling a mean of 40 patients each with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.11, we will have 90% power to detect a 5% absolute risk reduction. DISCUSSION: HUS is a devastating illness with no treatment options. This pragmatic study will determine if hyperhydration can reduce morbidity associated with HUS in children with high-risk STEC infection. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05219110 .

Use of oral vaccines as challenge agents in controlled human infection models is a potential approach to CoP discovery that remains underexplored. In a live-attenuated, oral rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix, GlaxoSmithKline) efficacy trial conducted among infants in Dhaka, Bangladesh, we explored the potential for the second dose of the two-dose series to be considered a challenge agent through which RVA immunity could be explored, using fecal virus shedding post-dose 2 as a marker of mucosal immunity. Among 180 vaccinated infants who completed the parent study per protocol, the absence of fecal vaccine shedding following the second dose of Rotarix suggested intestinal mucosal immunity generated by the first dose and a decreased risk of RVA diarrhea through 2 years of life (RR 0.616, 95% CI 0.392-0.968). Further development of controlled human infection models for group A rotaviruses, especially in prospective studies with larger sample sizes, may be a promising tool to assess rotavirus vaccine efficacy and CoPs."

(b) Methods: Once a cholera patient (confirmed by bacterial culture) is identified at a health facility, a health promoter delivers a targeted WASH intervention to the cholera hotspot (households within 20 m of a cholera patient) through both in-person visits during the first week and bi-weekly WASH mobile messages for the 3-month program period. A randomized controlled trial of the CHoBI7 Cholera Rapid Response Program was conducted with 284 participants in 15 cholera hotspots around cholera patients in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh. This program was compared to the standard message in Bangladesh on the use of oral rehydration solution for dehydration. Five-hour structured observation of handwashing with soap and diarrhea surveillance was conducted monthly. (c) Findings: Handwashing with soap at food- and stool-related events was significantly higher in the CHoBI7 Cholera Rapid Response Program arm compared to the standard message arm at all timepoints (overall 54% in the CHoBI7 arm vs. 23% in the standard arm, p < 0.05).

Optimal FMT donor and recipient characteristics are unknown. We assessed the safety and efficacy of FMT in patients with prior overt HE, comparing five FMT donors. We performed an open-label study of FMT capsules, administered 5 times over 3 weeks. Primary outcomes were change in psychometric HE score (PHES) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Serial stool samples underwent shallow shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Ten patients completed FMT administration and 6-month follow-up. Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score did not change after FMT (14 versus 14, p = 0.51). Thirteen minor adverse events and three serious adverse events (two unrelated to FMT) were reported. One SAE was extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli bacteremia. The PHES improved after three doses of FMT (+2.1, p < 0.05), after five doses of FMT (+2.9, p = 0.007), and 4 weeks after the fifth dose of FMT (+3.1, p = 0.02). Mean change in the PHES ranged from -1 to +6 by donor. Two taxa were identified by random forest analysis and confirmed by linear regression to predict the PHES- Bifidobacterium adolescentis (adjusted R(2) = 0.27) and B. angulatum (adjusted R(2) = 0.25)-both short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers. Patients who responded to FMT had higher levels of Bifidobacterium as well as other known beneficial taxa at baseline and throughout the study.

"Efficacy and Safety of BB-12 Supplemented Strawberry Yogurt For Healthy Children on Antibiotics (PLAY ON).","Merenstein D||Sparenborg J||Tan T||D'Amico F||Kumar A||Herbin Smith K","Annals of family medicine","10.1370/afm.22.s1.4765","21","Suppl 3","2024","Context: Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. One of the most common indications for probiotic treatment is the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Unfortunately, many probiotic products used for AAD are not supported by rigorous independent research, and often results in non-evidence-based usage. The overarching objective is to move research forward for the most well-studied Bifidobacterium strain. Objectives: The primary aim is to test the efficacy of high dose, BB-12-supplemented yogurt in preventing AAD, compared to yogurt without BB-12, in children receiving antibiotics. Other aims are to further assess the safety of yogurt supplemented with BB-12, and to carry out longitudinal community structure and gene expression analysis of fecal microbiota to evaluate the impact of high dose BB-12 in a pediatric population receiving antibiotics. The microbiota includes hundreds of species, and its disruption is hypothesized to be an important factor in the development of AAD. AIM 1: To test the efficacy of high dose, BB-12-supplemented yogurt in preventing AAD, compared to yogurt without BB-12, in children receiving antibiotics. Hypothesis: Children receiving antibiotics who receive the yogurt with BB-12 will demonstrate less diarrhea than those receiving a control yogurt without BB-12. This is a Phase II trial that requires additional safety evaluation of high dose BB-12. Hypotheses 3: Administration of antibiotics will alter the composition and gene expression profile of the gut microbiota in pediatric patients, and concomitant ingestion of BB-12 in yogurt will mitigate the antibiotic-induced disturbance in the gut microbiota, as identified using 16S rRNA and metatranscriptomic profiling. Study Design and Analysis: We will finish in the June 2023 a Phase II, randomized, doubleblinded controlled trial with allocation concealment. Setting: Capital Areal Primary Care Practice Based Research Network. Population Studied: 270 patients, ages 3-12 years, clinically diagnosed with a respiratory infection requiring 7-10 days of antibiotics. Interventions: The two arms are, BB-12-supplemented yogurt and non-supplemented control yogurt, in a 1:1 randomized allocation. Participants of all ages will be asked to consume the same dose, 100 ml, of product per day. The 100 ml serving of probiotic yogurt will deliver >/=1010 CFU of BB-12. The BB-12 probiotic was not be added."

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been applied as an effective tool for reestablishing the structure of gut microbiota. However, whether FMT could be applied as a routine SIBO treatment has not been investigated. METHODS: In this trial, 55 SIBO patients were enrolled. All participants were randomized in two groups, and were given FMT capsule or placebo capsules once a week for 4 consecutive weeks. Measurements including the lactulose hydrogen breath test gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as fecal microbiota diversity were assessed before and after FMT therapy. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal symptoms significantly improved in SIBO patients after treatment with FMT compared to participants in placebo group. The gut microbiota diversity of FMT group had a significant increase, while placebo group showed none. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that applying FMT for patients with SIBO can alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, indicating that FMT may be a promising and novel therapeutic regimen for SIBO.

DESIGN: A cluster randomised controlled trial was employed with two arms: handwashing with water and wood ash versus handwashing with water alone. SETTING: Rural households of East Dembiya District, Central Gondar Zone, Amhara National Regional State, Ethiopia. PARTICIPANTS: 440 mothers and caregivers of children younger than 5 years assigned (1:1, 220 in each group) in clusters, with buffer zones between each cluster. INTERVENTION: Health education on effective handwashing was given to the intervention and control groups. Participants in the intervention group used wood ash of the same quantity (ie, one closed palm). OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was microbial contamination of the hands, measured by means of Escherichia coli counts before and after handwashing. RESULTS: At baseline, 75.9% and 67.7% of the participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively, had dirt on their fingernails, and the hands of all participants in both groups were contaminated with E. coli. The mean E. coli counts recovered at baseline were 3.07 log10 colony forming unit (CFU)/swab in the intervention group and 3.03 log10 CFU/swab in the control group, while at endline it was 1.4 log10 CFU/swab in the intervention group and 3.02 log10 CFU/swab in the control group. The mean E.coli counts was reduced by 1.65 log10 due to the intervention (difference-in-differences: beta= -1.65, 95% CI= -1.84 to -1.46). CONCLUSION: Two-thirds of the swab samples tested positive for E. coli after handwashing with water and wood ash, which indicates wood ash is not very effective in terms of completely removing micro-organisms on the hands. However, wood ash was significantly better than water alone in reducing the concentration of faecal coliform organisms on the hands. Local health authorities should primarily promote handwashing with soap. However, in the absence of soap, use of wood ash over water alone might be appropriate.

It is unclear whether it is just a commensal or an infectious parasite that prompts eradication.The main objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of metronidazole in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms harbouring only Blastocystis sp. In addition, we explored whether Blastocystis subtype or concomitant parasitic infection detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may influence treatment outcome. METHODS: We included adults with persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (>14 days) visiting a primary care physician and in whom stool microscopy revealed only Blastocystis sp. Eligible patients were randomized to receive 10 days of metronidazole or placebo, followed by a crossover if still symptomatic. The primary outcome was normal stool consistency. Secondary outcomes were the changes in other abdominal symptoms (bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain, number of daily bowel movements) and general wellbeing. After the clinical phase of the study, Blastocystis subtypes were determined by PCR sequencing and stool samples were tested for 11 other protozoa with an in-house PCR. RESULTS: We screened 581 outpatients for inclusion, of which 50 met the eligibility criteria. There was no difference in the primary outcome, nor any of the secondary outcomes between the subjects treated with metronidazole and placebo.The most frequent Blastocystis subtypes were ST4 (11/36) and ST2 (10/36). The in-house PCR was positive for other protozoa in 25% (10/40) of the patients. We identified Dientamoeba fragilis in 5, Entamoeba dispar in 3 and Cyclospora cayetanensis in 2 patients. Stratified analysis according to Blastocystis subtype or the presence of other protozoa showed no significant difference in treatment outcome with metronidazole or placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients infected with Blastocystis sp., metronidazole, compared with placebo, was not better in improving gastrointestinal symptoms, irrespective of subtype or microscopically undetected coinfection with other protozoa."

The consumption of whole fat dairy products, naturally containing such polar lipids (PL), is associated with health benefits, but the impact on sphingolipidome remains unknown.METHODSIn a 4-week randomized controlled trial, 58 postmenopausal women daily consumed milk PL-enriched cream cheese (0, 3, or 5 g of milk PL). Postprandial metabolic explorations were performed before and after supplementation. Analyses included SM and Cer species in serum, chylomicrons, and feces. The ileal contents of 4 ileostomy patients were also explored after acute milk PL intake.RESULTSMilk PL decreased serum atherogenic C24:1 Cer, C16:1 SM, and C18:1 SM species (Pgroup < 0.05).

Polydextrose (PDX), a nondigestible oligosaccharide, has been reported as a fermentable fiber with potential benefits. This study aimed to investigate the possible influence of PDX supplementation on intestinal function in HD patients. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 28 patients who received daily oral supplementation with 12 g of PDX or placebo (corn starch) for 2 months. ROME IV criteria were used to define constipation and questionnaires were applied to patient assessment of constipation symptoms (PAC-SYM) and their impact on the patient assessment of constipation quality of life. The Bristol scale was used to assess stool consistency. Commercial Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay kits were used to evaluate the interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha plasma levels. RESULTS: 25 patients completed the study; 16 in the PDX group [7 females, 48.5 years (IQR = 15.5)] and 9 in the control group [3 females, 44.0 years (IQR = 6.0)]. According to ROME IV criteria, 55% of patients were diagnosed with constipation. PAC-SYM faecal symptoms domain was reduced after 2 months of PDX supplementation (P = .004). We also observed a significant reduction in the PAC-QoL-concerns domain (P = .02). The average values for PAC-SYM and patient assessment of constipation quality of lifewere reduced significantly after intervention with PDX. There were no significant changes after the intervention period concerning biochemical variables, food intake, and inflammation markers. No adverse effects were observed during the supplementation period. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that short-term PDX supplementation may have favourable results on intestinal function and the quality of life of chronic kidney disease patients in HD."

Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutic 2 (MET-2) is an oral encapsulated formulation of 40 lyophilised bacterial species initially isolated from stool of a healthy donor, but subsequently manufactured independently of donors, eliminating potential risks introduced by changes in donor health. The aim of this study was to determine MET-2 activity, safety, and tolerability. METHODS: This phase 1, open-label, single-group feasibility study was done in Alberta, Canada. The main inclusion criteria were mild to moderate C difficile infection and at least one episode of C difficile infection recurrence (ie, two episodes of C difficile infection) within 12 months. Initial daily treatment was ten oral capsules for 2 days, then three capsules for 8 days. If C difficile infection recurred, a higher dose was offered: 20 capsules for 2 days, then three capsules for 8 days. Patients were followed for adverse events and C difficile infection recurrence up to day 130. The primary outcome was absence of C difficile infection recurrence (fewer than three unformed bowel movements in 24 h persisting for at least 2 days) at day 40 by intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes were mortality or hospitalisation due to C difficile infection, infections attributed to treatment, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhoea during treatment, quality of life (C difficile Health Related Quality of Life Questionnaire) before and after treatment, and engrafted MET-2 bacteria in patient stool. Absence of C difficile infection recurrence at day 130 was an exploratory outcome. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02865616 FINDINGS: Between Sept 19, 2018, and Feb 28, 2020, we enrolled 19 adult patients with at least two episodes of mild to moderate C difficile infection (median age 65 years [IQR 56-67]; 12 women [63%], seven men [37%]). Recurrent C difficile infection was absent at day 40 in 15 (79%) of 19 patients after initial treatment, increasing to 18 (95%) 40 days after retreatment. No mortality associated with C difficile infection, infections associated with MET-2 treatment, or other serious adverse events were observed. The most common self-limited, mild to moderate symptoms reported during treatment were diarrhoea in 12 (63%) of 19 patients and abdominal cramps in 12 (63%). After MET-2 treatment, quality of life improved significantly, as did alpha diversity in stool microbial composition (p=1.93x10(-6)). MET-2 associated taxa were found in greater abundance in most patients after treatment compared with baseline. 16 (84%) of 19 patients did not have recurrence of C difficile infection by day 130. INTERPRETATION: MET-2 appears to be safe, efficacious, and well tolerated among patients with recurrent C difficile infection. Results must be validated in controlled studies. FUNDING: NuBiyota."

To address this problem, a novel hollow fiber ultrafilter (HFU) was developed for household water treatment. To test its impact on water quality and infant health, we conducted a cluster-randomized longitudinal evaluation in 10 intervention and 10 comparison villages in Kenya, attempting to enroll all households with infants (< 12 months old). We conducted a baseline survey, distributed HFUs to intervention households, made biweekly home visits for 1 year to assess water treatment practices and diarrhea in infants, and tested water samples from both groups every 2 months for Escherichia coli. We enrolled 92 infants from intervention households and 74 from comparison households. During the 1-year study period, 45.7% of intervention households and 97.3% of comparison households had at least one stored water sample test positive for E. coli. Compared with comparison households, the odds of E. coli contamination in stored water was lower for intervention households (odds ratio [OR]: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.74), but there was no difference in the odds of reported diarrhea in infants, adjusting for covariates (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.74, 1.90). Although nearly all water samples obtained from unprotected sources and filtered by the HFU were free of E. coli contamination, HFUs alone were not effective at reducing diarrhea in infants."

In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we included 89 term neonates treated with antibiotics. Neonates received the study product for six weeks. FGIDs, assessed by the Infant Gastrointestinal Symptom Questionnaire, crying and sleep duration were assessed at four and eight weeks, and six months after enrolment. Faecal samples were collected six weeks and twelve months after enrolment. The gut microbial community composition was analysed using 16S amplicon sequencing and qPCR. The proportion of infants with FGIDs was greater in the control group, although the difference between the groups was significant only six months after enrolment. At all time points, the probiotic group presented a longer sleep duration and shorter crying time than the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Probiotic consumption had no significant effect on the gut microbiota composition except for increased L. reuteri DSM 17938 abundance in the probiotic group at six weeks after enrolment. At specific time points after supplementation with L. reuteri DSM 17938, a reduction in the prevalence of FGIDs was observed in the probiotic group. However, no observable effect on the gut microbiota was detected during the intervention. We believe that probiotic supplementation in neonates during and after antibiotic treatment to minimise the negative effects of antibiotics on gut function during this vulnerable period of human development warrants further investigation.

We hypothesized that the intestinal microbiota changes earlier than this timepoint, and analyzed fecal samples obtained 1 week after treatment from 64 patients diagnosed with recurrent CDI and included in a randomized clinical trial, where the infection was treated with either vancomycin-preceded FMT (N = 24), vancomycin (N = 16) or fidaxomicin (N = 24). In comparison with non-responders, patients with sustained resolution after FMT had increased microbial alpha diversity, enrichment of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, depletion of Enterobacteriaceae, more pronounced donor microbiota engraftment, and resolution of gut microbiota dysbiosis. We found that a constructed index, based on markers for the identified genera Escherichia and Blautia, successfully predicted clinical outcomes at Week 8, which exemplifies a way to utilize clinically feasible methods to predict treatment failure. Microbiota changes were restricted to patients who received FMT rather than antibiotic monotherapy, indicating that FMT confers treatment response in a different way than antibiotics. We suggest that early identification of microbial community structures after FMT is of clinical value to predict response to the treatment."

The water exchange method has the advantage of facilitating intubation during colonoscopy. Here, we evaluated the effects of water exchange on procedure-related variables related to SBE. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary-care referral center in China. Patients due for attempted total enteroscopy were randomly allocated to undergo water exchange-assisted (water exchange group) or carbon dioxide-insufflated enteroscopy (CO(2) group). All patients were planned to undergo both anterograde and retrograde procedures. The primary outcome was the total enteroscopy rate. Secondary outcomes included the maximal insertion depth, positive findings, procedural time, and adverse events. RESULTS: In total, 110 patients were enrolled, with 55 in each group. Baseline characteristics between the two groups were comparable. Total enteroscopy was achieved in 58.2 % (32/55) of the water exchange group and 36.4 % (20/55) of the control group (P = 0.02). The mean (standard deviation) estimated intubation depth was 521.2 (101.4) cm in the water exchange group and 481.6 (95.2) cm in the CO(2) group (P = 0.04).

While novel microbiome therapeutics gain approval, the efficacy of a full-spectrum, oral microbiome therapeutic is unknown. This study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of CP101, an orally administered microbiome therapeutic, to restore a diverse microbiome and prevent recurrent CDI in a broad population. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in adults with recurrent CDI. Participants with one or more CDI recurrences and diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction or toxin enzyme immunoassay for the qualifying episode were included. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive a single oral dose of either CP101 ( approximately 6 x 10(11) colony-forming units of lyophilized microbial cells) or placebo after standard-of-care antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants without CDI recurrence through week 8. Safety, efficacy, and microbiome endpoints were evaluated through weeks 8 and 24. RESULTS: A total of 198 participants were analyzed: CP101 (n = 102) and placebo (n = 96). Overall, 27.5% had a first recurrence, and 62.7% were diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction-based testing. The proportion without CDI recurrence through week 8 was significantly higher in the CP101 group compared to the placebo group (74.5% [76 of 102] vs 61.5% [59 of 96], respectively; P = .0488), with durable efficacy observed through week 24 (73.5% [75 of 102] vs 59.4% [57 of 96], respectively; P = .0347). Similar efficacy was observed regardless of diagnostic modality or number of CDI recurrences. Rapid and durable increase in microbiome diversity was observed in the CP101 group compared to the placebo group. The incidence of adverse events was similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: CP101 was superior to placebo in reducing recurrent CDI with a safety profile similar to placebo. (ClinicalTrials.gov, Number NCT03110133)."

The objective of the Preventative Intervention for Cholera for 7 Days (PICHA7) program is to develop evidence-based water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions to reduce cholera and other severe diarrheal diseases in the DRC. The study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of PICHA7 program delivery in increasing handwashing with a cleansing agent at stool/vomit- and food-related events in a healthcare facility setting among diarrhea patients and patient attendants. A pilot of the PICHA7 program was conducted among 284 participants in 27 healthcare facilities from March 2020 to November 2021 in urban Bukavu in the South Kivu Province of the DRC. The standard arm received the standard message provided in the DRC to diarrhea patients on the use of oral rehydration solution and a basic WASH message at healthcare facility discharge. The PICHA7 arm received the PICHA7 WASH pictorial module delivered by a health promoter focused on handwashing with a cleansing agent at the bedside of the diarrhea patient in the healthcare facility and provision of a soapy water bottle (water and detergent powder). Within 24 h of intervention delivery, a three-hour structured observation of handwashing practices at stool/vomit- and food-related events (key events) was conducted in healthcare facilities of diarrhea patients and their attendants. Compared to the standard arm, there was significantly more handwashing with a cleansing agent at key events in the PICHA7 arm (40% vs. 15%) (odds ratio: 5.04; (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.01, 12.7)). These findings demonstrate that delivery of the PICHA7 WASH pictorial module and provision of a soapy water bottle to diarrhea patients and their attendants presents a promising approach to increase handwashing with a cleansing agent among this high-risk population in healthcare facilities in the eastern DRC."

METHODS: Food-insecure adult smallholder farmers living with HIV in western Kenya were recruited to participate in a cluster-randomized controlled trial of a multisectoral agricultural and asset loan intervention. We used baseline data on experiences of FI (using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale, range: 0-27) and WI (using a modified scale developed for this region, range: 0-51) in the prior month (n = 716). Outcomes included probable depression (using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist), fatigue and diarrhea in the prior month, and overall mental and physical health (using the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey, range: 0-100). We first assessed Pearson correlations between FI, WI, and sociodemographic characteristics. We then developed 3 regressions for each health outcome (control variables and FI; control variables and WI; control variables, FI, and WI) and compared model fit indexes. RESULTS: Correlations between household FI, WI, and wealth were low, meaning they measure distinct constructs. FI and WI were associated with numerous physical and mental health outcomes; accounting for both resource insecurities typically provided the best model fit. For instance, when controlling for FI, each 10-point higher WI score was associated with a 6.42-point lower physical health score (P < 0.001) and 2.92 times greater odds of probable depression (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Assessing both FI and WI is important for correctly estimating their relation with health outcomes. Interventions that address food- and water-related issues among persons living with HIV concurrently will likely be more effective at improving health than those addressing a single resource insecurity. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02815579."

We aimed to study the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 on intestinal permeability and stress-markers during public speech. Healthy students were randomized to L. rhamnosus-containing (test) or acidified (placebo) milk consumed twice daily for 4 weeks, with 46 subjects per treatment group. Small intestinal permeability was quantified by a 2 h urinary lactulose-mannitol ratio (LMR, primary outcome), fractional excretion of lactulose (FEL) and mannitol (FEM). Salivary cortisol, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Perceived Stress scores (PSS) were collected. No between-treatment differences were found for LMR (p = .71), FEL or FEM. Within-treatment analyses showed similar LMR and FEL but a stress-induced increase of FEM with the placebo (p < .05) but not test product. Despite a similar increase in salivary cortisol, the stress-induced increase in STAI was significantly lower with the test product vs. placebo (p = .01). Moreover, a stress-preventative effect of the probiotic was found for PSS and more pronounced in subjects with high stress-induced cortisol (p = .01). While increased FEM was mediated by salivary cortisol levels, the effect of the test product on subjective stress was not mediated by changes in FEM. No serious adverse events occurred. In conclusion, we demonstrated that L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 prevented stress-induced hyperpermeability to mannitol. Subjective but not objective stress-markers were reduced with L. rhamnosus vs. placebo, suggesting anxiolytic effects, which were independent of barrier stabilization and attractive for the reduction of stress in both health and disease.

"Improved Child Feces Management Mediates Reductions in Childhood Diarrhea from an On-Site Sanitation Intervention: Causal Mediation Analysis of a Cluster-Randomized Trial in Rural Bangladesh.","Contreras JD||Islam M||Mertens A||Pickering AJ||Arnold BF||Benjamin-Chung J||Hubbard AE||Rahman M||Unicomb L||Luby SP||Colford JM Jr||Ercumen A","Journal of epidemiology and global health","10.1007/s44197-024-00210-y","14","3","2024","BACKGROUND: The WASH benefits Bangladesh trial multi-component sanitation intervention reduced diarrheal disease among children < 5 years. Intervention components included latrine upgrades, child feces management tools, and behavioral promotion. It remains unclear which components most impacted diarrhea. METHODS: We conducted mediation analysis within a subset of households (n = 720) from the sanitation and control arms. Potential mediators were categorized into indicators of latrine quality, latrine use practices, and feces management practices. We estimated average causal mediation effects (ACME) as prevalence differences (PD), defined as the intervention's effect on diarrhea through its effect on the mediator. RESULTS: The intervention improved all indicators compared to controls. We found significant mediation through multiple latrine use and feces management practice indicators. The strongest mediators during monsoon seasons were reduced open defecation among children aged < 3 and 3-8 years, and increased disposal of child feces into latrines. The strongest mediators during dry seasons were access to a flush/pour-flush latrine, reduced open defecation among children aged 3-8 years, and increased disposal of child feces into latrines. Individual mediation effects were small (PD = 0.5-2 percentage points) compared to the overall intervention effect but collectively describe significant mediation pathways. DISCUSSION: The effect of the WASH Benefits Bangladesh sanitation intervention on diarrheal disease was mediated through improved child feces management and reduced child open defecation. Although the intervention significantly improved latrine quality, relatively high latrine quality at baseline may have limited benefits from additional improvements. Targeting safe child feces management may increase the health benefits of rural sanitation interventions."

As such, they are termed prolonged diarrhoea, and are associated with over two-thirds of all diarrhoeal deaths. Due to a lack of robust data, we aimed to evaluate a comparative background characteristics of young children with acute and prolonged diarrhoea, and their outcomes at day 90 follow-up. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of data from the Antibiotics for Children with Diarrhea (ABCD) trial. Children aged 2-23 months were enrolled between July 2017 and July 2019 from seven Asian and sub-Saharan African countries. For this analysis, we divide diarrhoea into two categories: acute diarrhoea (duration <7 days) and prolonged diarrhoea (duration >/=7-13 days). We used logistic regression to observe baseline crude and adjusted associations and linear regression to compare post-discharge outcomes. RESULTS: We analysed data on 8266 children, of whom 756 (9%) had prolonged diarrhoea and 7510 (91%) had acute diarrhoea. Pakistan had the highest proportion of children with prolonged diarrhoea (n/N = 178/1132, 16%), while Tanzania had the lowest (n/N = 12/1200, 1%). From an analysis that adjusted for sex, breastfeeding, nutritional status, clinical presentation, housing, water supply, sanitation, and country, we observed that presentation at a health facility with prolonged diarrhoea was associated with low age (2-12 months) (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02, 1.53; P = 0.028), presence of three or more under-five children in the family (aOR = 1.54; 95% CI = 1.26, 1.87; P < 0.001), maternal illiteracy (aOR = 1.45; 95% CI = 1.21, 1.74, P < 0.001), moderate underweight (aOR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.01, 1.55; P = 0.042) and pathogen (Campylobacter) (aOR = 1.27; 95% CI = 1.12, 1.44; P < 0.001). At day 90 follow-up, children with prolonged diarrhoea had significantly lower weight-for-age z-score compared to children with acute diarrhoea (-1.62, standard deviation (SD) = 1.11 vs -1.52, SD = 1.20; P = 0.032), as well as significantly higher frequency of hospital admission (6.1% vs 4.5%; P = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged diarrhoea was more common in children of younger age, those who were moderately underweight, those with Campylobacter in stool, those with three or more under-five children in a family, and those with illiterate mothers compared to those who had acute diarrhoea. Children with prolonged diarrhoea more often required hospitalisation during the three-month follow-up period compared to their counterparts."

The trial enrolled 2,705 married women and their children 3 years or younger in 96 rural settlements (geographic clusters) in Sylhet Division, Bangladesh. The intervention promoted home gardening and poultry rearing alongside child nutrition and health counseling over 3 years (2015-2018). An 8-month food hygiene behavior change component using emotional drivers was delivered beginning in mid-2017. Caregiver-reported diarrhea and symptoms of ARI in the week preceding the survey were recorded every 2 months. We analyzed 32,460 observations of 3,276 children over 4 years and found that 3.9% of children had diarrhea and 3.4% had an ARI in the prior 7 days. There was no overall effect of the intervention on 7-day diarrhea period prevalence (odds ratio [OR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.71-1.19), diarrhea point prevalence (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.78-1.36), or 7-day ARI period prevalence (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.88-1.60). There was no impact on diarrhea severity or differences in health-seeking behaviors. Our findings suggest that this homestead food production program was insufficient to reduce morbidity symptoms among children in a rural setting. More comprehensive water, sanitation, and hygiene measures, and behavioral recommendations may be needed to achieve impacts on child health."

We examined the impact of an urban school-based WASH programme (Project WISE) on child health and attendance. METHODS: The WISE cluster-randomised trial, conducted in 60 public primary schools in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia over one academic year, enrolled 2-4 randomly selected classes per school (~ 100 pupils) from grades 2 to 8 (aged 7-16) in an 'open cohort'. Schools were assigned 1:1 by stratified randomisation to receive the intervention during the 2021/2022 or the 2022/2023 academic year (waitlist control). The intervention included improvements to drinking water storage, filtration and access, handwashing stations and behaviour change promotion. Planned sanitation improvements were not realised. At four unannounced classroom visits post-intervention (March-June 2022), enumerators recorded primary outcomes of roll-call absence, and pupil-reported respiratory illness and diarrhoea in the past 7 days among pupils present. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. RESULTS: Of 83 eligible schools, 60 were randomly selected and assigned. In total, 6229 eligible pupils were enrolled (median per school 101.5; IQR 94-112), 5987 enrolled at study initiation (23rd November-22nd December 2021) and the remaining 242 during follow-up. Data were available on roll-call absence for 6166 pupils (99.0%), and pupil-reported illness for 6145 pupils (98.6%). We observed a 16% relative reduction in odds of pupil-reported respiratory illness in the past 7 days during follow-up in intervention vs. control schools (aOR 0.84; 95% CI 0.71-1.00; p = 0.046). There was no evidence of effect on pupil-reported diarrhoea in the past 7 days (aOR 1.15; 95% CI 0.84-1.59; p = 0.39) nor roll-call absence (aOR 1.07; 95% 0.83-1.38; p = 0.59). There was a small increase in menstrual care self-efficacy (aMD 3.32 on 0-100 scale; 95% CI 0.05-6.59), and no evidence of effects on other secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale intervention to improve school WASH conditions city-wide had a borderline impact on pupil-reported respiratory illness but no effect on diarrhoeal disease nor pupil absence. Future research should establish relationships between WASH-related illness, absence and other educational outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT05024890."

The WASH Benefits Bangladesh trial implemented a multicomponent sanitation intervention that led to a 39% reduction in the prevalence of diarrhea among children and a 25% reduction for ARI, measured 1 to 2 years after intervention implementation. We measured longer-term intervention effects on these outcomes between 1 to 3.5 years after intervention implementation, including periods with differing intensity of behavioral promotion. METHODS AND FINDINGS: WASH Benefits Bangladesh was a cluster-randomized controlled trial of water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition interventions (NCT01590095). The sanitation intervention included provision of or upgrades to improved latrines, sani-scoops for feces removal, children's potties, and in-person behavioral promotion. Promotion was intensive up to 2 years after intervention initiation, decreased in intensity between years 2 to 3, and stopped after 3 years. Access to and reported use of latrines was high in both arms, and latrine quality was significantly improved by the intervention, while use of child feces management tools was low. We enrolled a random subset of households from the sanitation and control arms into a longitudinal substudy, which measured child health with quarterly visits between 1 to 3.5 years after intervention implementation. The study period therefore included approximately 1 year of high-intensity promotion, 1 year of low-intensity promotion, and 6 months with no promotion. We assessed intervention effects on diarrhea and ARI prevalence among children <5 years through intention-to-treat analysis using generalized linear models with robust standard errors. Masking was not possible during data collection, but data analysis was masked. We enrolled 720 households (360 per arm) from the parent trial and made 9,800 child observations between June 2014 and December 2016. Over the entire study period, diarrheal prevalence was lower among children in the sanitation arm (11.9%) compared to the control arm (14.5%) (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.81, 95% CI 0.66, 1.00, p = 0.05; prevalence difference [PD] = -0.027, 95% CI -0.053, 0, p = 0.05). ARI prevalence did not differ between sanitation (21.3%) and control (22.7%) arms (PR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.82, 1.05, p = 0.23; PD = -0.016, 95% CI -0.043, 0.010, p = 0.23). There were no significant differences in intervention effects between periods with high-intensity versus low-intensity/no promotion. Study limitations include use of caregiver-reported symptoms to define health outcomes and limited data collected after promotion ceased. CONCLUSIONS: The observed effect of the WASH Benefits Bangladesh sanitation intervention on diarrhea in children appeared to be sustained for at least 3.5 years after implementation, including 1.5 years after heavy promotion ceased. Existing latrine access was high in the study setting, suggesting that improving on-site latrine quality can deliver health benefits when latrine use practices are in place. Further work is needed to understand how latrine adoption can be achieved and sustained in settings with low existing access and how sanitation programs can adopt transformative approaches of excreta management, including safe disposal of child and animal feces, to generate a hygienic home environment.

METHODS: In a double blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult participants aged 18-70 years old with MASLD were randomized to receive prebiotic (oligofructose-enriched inulin, 16 g/day; n = 22) or isocaloric placebo (maltodextrin; n = 20) for 24 weeks alongside weight loss counseling from a registered dietitian. Primary outcomes were change in intrahepatic fat % (IHF%) and hepatic injury from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included body composition, subjective appetite, serum lipids and cytokines, fecal microbiota, and serum metabolomics. RESULTS: At baseline, participants had IHF of 14.4 +/- 8.4%. The change in IHF from baseline to 24 weeks did not differ between prebiotic and placebo. Prebiotic participants had a greater decrease (p = 0.029) in percent trunk fat compared to placebo. Compared to placebo, prebiotic significantly decreased desire to eat and hunger ratings over the course of the intervention. Fecal microbiota analysis showed a significant increase in Bifidobacterium abundance with prebiotic. A pathway analysis based on untargeted serum metabolomics revealed a downregulation of taurine and hypotaurine metabolism in the placebo group which was conserved in the prebiotic group. CONCLUSION: Adding prebiotic fiber supplementation to weight loss counseling for adults with MASLD enhanced reductions in trunk fat and had a beneficial effect on subjective appetite compared to placebo. Improvements in fecal microbial profile and taurine metabolism revealed specific beneficial effects of prebiotics in the management of MASLD.

Consequently, it exerts detrimental effects on a part of the worldwide population who are afflicted with celiac disease (1%) or related disorders (5%), particularly due to the potential for cross-contamination even when adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Finding solutions to break down gluten during digestion has a high nutritional and social impact. Here, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled in vivo challenge investigated the gluten-degrading activity of a novel probiotic preparation comprising lactobacilli and their cytoplasmic extracts, Bacillus sp., and bacterial protease. In our clinical trial, we collected feces from 70 healthy volunteers at specific time intervals. Probiotic/placebo administration lasted 32 days, followed by 10 days of wash-out. After preliminary GFD to eliminate residual gluten from feces, increasing amounts of gluten (50 mg-10 g) were administered, each one for 4 consecutive days. Compared to placebo, the feces of volunteers fed with probiotics showed much lower amounts of residual gluten, mainly with increased intakes. Probiotics also regulate the intestinal microbial communities, improving the abundance of genera pivotal to maintaining homeostasis. Quantitative PCR confirmed that all probiotics persisted during the intervention, some also during wash-out. Probiotics promoted a fecal metabolome with potential immunomodulating activity, mainly related to derivatives of branched-chain amino acids and short-chain fatty acids. IMPORTANCE: The untapped potential of gluten-degrading bacteria and their application in addressing the recognized limitations of gluten-related disorder management and the ongoing risk of cross-contamination even when people follow a gluten-free diet (GFD) emphasizes the significance of the work. Because gluten, a common protein found in many cereals, must be strictly avoided to stop autoimmune reactions and related health problems, celiac disease and gluten sensitivity present difficult hurdles. However, because of the hidden presence of gluten in many food products and the constant danger of cross-contamination during food preparation and processing, total avoidance is frequently challenging. Our study presents a novel probiotic preparation suitable for people suffering from gluten-related disorders during GFD and for healthy individuals because it enhances gluten digestion and promotes gut microbiota functionality."

Despite high latrine coverage, only 37% of Indian households safely dispose of their child's feces into a latrine or have the child use the latrine, with the lowest rate in the state of Odisha at 12%. We evaluated a behavior change and hardware intervention designed to improve caregiver safe disposal of child feces and child latrine use. METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial among 74 villages in rural Odisha, India. Eligible villages previously participated in a water and sanitation infrastructure program. Following a baseline survey, half the villages were assigned to intervention and half to control. Caregivers of children < 5 years old from households with a latrine were eligible to participate. The intervention included five behavior change activities. Hardware was provided at the first activity, based on child age, to aid safe disposal and latrine training (wash basin and bucket with lid for children < 7 months old; latrine training mat platform with removable tray for children 7 to 48 months old). The primary outcome was caregiver reported 'safe disposal' as defined by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) which encompasses two behaviors: caregiver disposal of child's feces into a latrine and child latrine use. Safe disposal was measured four to six months after intervention delivery (endline). RESULTS: Endline analysis included 665 intervention caregivers (840 children) and 634 control caregivers (785 children). Prevalence of JMP-defined safe disposal was 1.16 times greater in the intervention arm compared to control (77.7% vs. 65.9%; prevalence ratio [PR] 1.16, 95% CI 1.04-1.29), with higher prevalence of caregiver safe disposal (18.6% vs. 13.6%; PR 1.46, 95% CI 1.12-1.92) but no significant difference in child latrine use (59.0% vs. 52.2%; PR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95-1.18). When restricted to children < 3 years old, JMP-defined safe disposal was 1.42 times greater (67.5% vs. 46.7%; PR 1.42 95% CI 1.21-1.67) with higher prevalence of both caregiver safe disposal (34.6% vs. 25.7%; PR 1.44, 95% CI 1.11-1.86) and child latrine use (32.9% vs. 20.9%; PR 1.41, 95% CI 1.08-1.83). CONCLUSIONS: The intervention increased JMP-defined safe disposal, with substantial improvements in both caregiver safe disposal and child latrine use among children < 3 years old. While future research is needed to demonstrate sustainability of these effects, our results suggest a potentially scalable intervention for improving child feces disposal and reducing disease.

STUDY: Treatment success rates across subgroups for PUNCH CD3 (NCT03244644) were estimated using a Bayesian hierarchical model, borrowing data from PUNCH CD2 (NCT02299570). Treatment-emergent adverse events were summarized for the double-blind treatment period within 8 weeks. RESULTS: Treatment differences between RBL and placebo at 8 weeks were similar to the total population for most subgroups. Treatment effect sizes were similar between CDI tests, higher for oral vancomycin courses >14 days versus </=14 days and higher for antibiotic washout periods of 3 days versus </=2 days. The largest reductions in the rate of rCDI with RBL versus placebo were observed for participants with a 3-day CDI antibiotic washout period and participants with >/=4 previous CDI episodes. Most RBL-treated participants experienced TEAEs that were mild or moderate in severity and related to preexisting conditions. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides further evidence of RBL efficacy and safety across subgroups, including those at high risk for rCDI."

A cluster-randomized controlled trial of the CHoBI7 mHealth program was conducted among diarrhea patient households in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Patients were randomized to three arms: standard recommendation on oral rehydration solution use, health facility delivery of CHoBI7 plus mHealth (weekly voice and text messages for 12 months) (no home visits), and health facility delivery of CHoBI7 plus two home visits and mHealth. Respiratory symptoms were assessed during monthly clinical surveillance over the 12-month surveillance period. Respiratory illness was defined as rapid breathing, difficulty breathing, wheezing, or coughing. Two thousand six hundred twenty-six participants in 769 households were randomly allocated to three arms: 849 participants to the standard message arm, 886 to the mHealth with no home visits arm, and 891 to the mHealth with two home visits arm. Compared with the standard message arm, participants in the mHealth with no home visits arm (Prevalence Ratio [PR]: 0.89 [95% CI: 0.80, 0.98]), and the mHealth with two home visits arm (PR: 0.89 [95% CI: 0.81, 0.99]) had significantly lower respiratory illness prevalence over the 12-month program period. Our findings demonstrate that the CHoBI7 mHealth program is effective in reducing respiratory illness among diarrhea patient households."

METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center trial, 280 patients with PD were screened, and 72 eligible patients were block-randomized (1:1) to receive either multistrain probiotics capsules (n = 34) or identical-appearing placebo (n = 38), for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in the average number of spontaneous bowel movements (SBM) per week during the last 2 weeks of intervention compared with the 2-week preintervention phase, recorded by daily stool diary. Secondary outcome measures included changes in stool consistency, constipation severity score, and quality of life related to constipation. Satisfaction with intervention received was assessed. Change in levels of fecal calprotectin, a marker of intestinal inflammation, was an exploratory outcome. RESULTS: SBM increased by 1.0 +/- 1.2 per week after treatment with probiotics and decreased by 0.3 +/- 1.0 per week in the placebo group (mean difference 1.3, 95% confidence interval 0.8-1.8, p < 0.001). Significant improvements were also seen for secondary outcomes after correction for multiple comparisons, including stool consistency (p = 0.009) and quality of life related to constipation (p = 0.001). In the treatment group, 65.6% reported satisfaction with the intervention vs only 21.6% in the placebo group (p < 0.001). One patient (2.9%) in the treatment group withdrew due to a nonserious adverse event. Fecal calprotectin did not change significantly during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Multistrain probiotics treatment was effective for constipation in PD. Further studies are needed to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of probiotics in PD, as well as their mechanisms of action. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT03377322. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that, for people with PD, multistrain probiotics significantly increased the average number of SBM per week."
"Improving knowledge, attitudes, and practices on dengue and diarrhea in rural primary school students, their parents, and teachers in Colombia: A cluster-randomized controlled trial.","Sarmiento-Senior D||Matiz MI||Vargas-Cruz S||Jaramillo JF||Olano VA||Lenhart A||Stenstrom TA||Alexander N||Overgaard HJ","PLoS neglected tropical diseases","10.1371/journal.pntd.0010985","16","12","2022","BACKGROUND: Improved education on water-related diseases in schools could help to reduce disease burden. This paper presents specific results on knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of a cluster-randomized controlled trial to reduce diarrheal disease and dengue entomological risk factors in rural primary schools in Colombia. The aim was to investigate whether enhanced educational interventions on dengue and diarrheal disease in schools could improve KAP scores related to these diseases in students and teachers in rural primary schools, as well as the students' parents. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A factorial cluster-randomized controlled trial was carried out in 35 rural primary schools in two municipalities in Cundinamarca, central Colombia. Schools were randomized into four arms: interventions related to diarrheal disease (DIA), dengue (DEN), both (DIADEN), or no interventions (control, CON). Both educational and physical interventions to reduce risk factors of dengue and diarrhea were implemented. Comprehensive teachers' manuals were developed and deployed to guide the learning activities. The intervention was carried out over two school years. The knowledge scores of students receiving dengue interventions (DEN, DIADEN) increased by 1.16 point score (0.75-1.56, p<0.001) and those receiving diarrhea interventions (DIA, DIADEN) increased by 1.15 point score (0.67-1.63, p<0.001). The attitude and practice scores of students receiving the diarrhea interventions increased (Attitudes: 0.41 [0.11-0.71, p = 0.01]; Practices: 0.33 [0.01-0.65, p = 0.042]), but not for those receiving the dengue interventions (p = 0.31 and p = 0.08, respectively). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: There were increases in knowledge scores among students, their teachers and their parents for both diseases. However, the attitudes and practices components were not affected to the same extent. The hypothesis that the students would disseminate knowledge acquired from the educational interventions to their parents was confirmed for dengue, but not for diarrhea.

The effect of culinary doses of herbs and spices consumed as part of a well-defined dietary pattern on gut bacterial composition has not been previously studied. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this prespecified exploratory analysis was to examine gut bacterial composition following an average American diet (carbohydrate: 50% kcal; protein: 17%; total fat: 33%; saturated fat: 11%) containing herbs and spices at 0.5, 3.3, and 6.6 g.d(-1).2100 kcal(-1) [low-, moderate-, and high-spice diets, respectively (LSD, MSD, and HSD)] in adults at risk for CVD. METHODS: Fifty-four adults (57% female; mean +/- SD age: 45 +/- 11 y; BMI: 29.8 +/- 2.9 kg/m(2); waist circumference: 102.8 +/- 7.1 cm) were included in this 3-period, randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding study. Each diet was provided for 4 wk with a minimum 2-wk washout period. At baseline and the end of each diet period, participants provided a fecal sample for 16S rRNA gene (V4 region) sequencing. QIIME2 was used for data filtration, sequence clustering, taxonomy assignment, and statistical analysis. RESULTS: alpha-diversity assessed by the observed features metric ( P = 0.046) was significantly greater following the MSD as compared with the LSD; no other between-diet differences in alpha-diversity were detected. Differences in beta-diversity were not observed between the diets ( P = 0.45). Compared with baseline, beta-diversity differed following all diets ( P < .02). Enrichment of the Ruminococcaceae family was observed following the HSD as compared with the MSD (relative abundance = 22.14%, linear discriminant analysis = 4.22, P = 0.03) and the LSD (relative abundance = 24.90%, linear discriminant analysis = 4.47, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of herbs and spices to an average American diet induced shifts in gut bacterial composition after 4 wk in adults at risk for CVD. The metabolic implications of these changes merit further investigation. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03064932."
"The impact of daily supplementation with rhamnogalacturonan-I on the gut microbiota in healthy adults: A randomized controlled trial.","Jian C||Sorensen N||Lutter R||Albers R||de Vos W||Salonen A||Mercenier A","Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie","10.1016/j.biopha.2024.116561","174",NA,"2024","Pectin and its derivatives have been shown to modulate immune signaling as well as gut microbiota in preclinical studies, which may constitute the mechanisms by which supplementation of specific pectic polysaccharides confers protection against viral respiratory infections. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled rhinovirus (RV16) challenge study, healthy volunteers were randomized to consume placebo (0.0 g/day) (N = 46), low-dose (0.3 g/day) (N = 49) or high-dose (1.5 g/day) (N = 51) of carrot derived rhamnogalacturonan-I (cRG-I) for eight weeks and they were subsequently challenged with RV-16. Here, the effect of 8-week cRG-I supplementation on the gut microbiota was studied. While the overall gut microbiota composition in the population was generally unaltered by this very low dose of fibre, the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. (mainly B. adolescentis and B. longum) was significantly increased by both doses of cRG-1. Moreover, daily supplementation of cRG-I led to a dose-dependent reduction in inter- and intra-individual microbiota heterogeneity, suggesting a stabilizing effect on the gut microbiota. The severity of respiratory symptoms did not directly correlate with the cRG-I-induced microbial changes, but several dominant groups of the Ruminococcaceae family and microbiota richness were positively associated with a reduced and hence desired post-infection response. Thus, the present results on the modulation of the gut microbiota composition support the previously demonstrated immunomodulatory and protective effect of cRG-I during a common cold infection."

Nutritional strategies have been proposed to modulate the gut microbiota and reduce the production of these toxins. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of amylose-resistant starch (RS) supplementation on TMAO plasma levels in HD patients. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT02706808) with patients undergoing HD enrolled in a previous pilot study. The participants were allocated to RS or placebo groups to receive 16 g/d of RS or placebo for 4 weeks. Plasma TMAO, choline, and betaine levels were measured with LC-MS/MS. Fecal microbiome composition was evaluated by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, followed by a search for TMA-associated taxa. Anthropometric, routine biochemical parameters, and food intake were evaluated. Twenty-five participants finished the study, 13 in the RS group, and 12 in the placebo group. RS supplementation did not reduce TMAO plasma levels. Moreover, no significant alterations were observed in choline, betaine, anthropometric, biochemical parameters, or food intake in both groups. Likewise, RS was not found to exert any influence on the proportion of potential TMA-producing bacterial taxa in fecal matter. RS supplementation did not influence plasma TMAO, choline, betaine, or fecal taxa potentially linked to TMAO. Thus, RS does not seem to modify the TMA-associated bacterial taxa, precursors of TMAO.

Although cardiometabolic prevention should start early, we lack evidence on the effects in children. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effects of wholegrain oats and rye intake on serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and plasma insulin (coprimary outcomes), other cardiometabolic markers, body composition, gut microbiota composition and metabolites, and gastrointestinal symptoms in children with high body mass index (BMI). METHODS: In a randomized crossover trial, 55 healthy Danish 8- to 13-y-olds received wholegrain oats and rye (""WG"") or refined grain (""RG"") products ad libitum for 8 wk in random order. At 0, 8, and 16 wk, we measured anthropometry, body composition by dual-energy absorptiometry, and blood pressure. Fasting blood and fecal samples were collected for analysis of blood lipids, glucose homeostasis markers, gut microbiota, and short-chain fatty acids. Gut symptoms and stool characteristics were determined by questionnaires. Diet was assessed by 4-d dietary records and compliance by plasma alkylresorcinols (ARs). RESULTS: Fifty-two children (95%) with a BMI z-score of 1.5 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- standard deviation) completed the study. They consumed 108 +/- 38 and 3 +/- 2 g/d wholegrain in the WG and RG period, which was verified by a profound difference in ARs (P < 0.001). Compared with RG, WG reduced LDL cholesterol by 0.14 (95% confidence interval: -0.24, -0.04) mmol/L (P = 0.009) and reduced total:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < 0.001) and triacylglycerol (P = 0.048) without altering body composition or other cardiometabolic markers. WG also modulated the abundance of specific bacterial taxa, increased plasma acetate, propionate, and butyrate and fecal butyrate and reduced fatigue with no other effects on gut symptoms. CONCLUSION: High intake of wholegrain oats and rye reduced LDL cholesterol and triacylglycerol, modulated bacterial taxa, and increased beneficial metabolites in children. This supports recommendations of exchanging refined grain with wholegrain oats and rye among children. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04430465."

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from Shamba Maisha (NCT02815579), a cluster randomized controlled trial of a multisectoral agricultural and asset loan intervention. Baseline data were collected from June 2016 to December 2017. We assessed associations between water insecurity and HIV-related outcomes, adjusting for clinical and behavioral confounders, including food insecurity. Each five-unit higher household water insecurity score (range: 0-51) was associated with 1.21 higher odds of having a viral load >/= 1000 copies/mL (95% CI 1.07, 1.36) and 1.26 higher odds of AIDS-defining illness (95% CI 1.11, 1.42). Household water insecurity was not associated with CD4 cell count (B: 0.27; 95% CI -3.59, 13.05). HIV treatment and support programs should consider assessing and addressing water insecurity in addition to food insecurity to optimize HIV outcomes."

We assess effects of water, sanitation, handwashing (WSH) and nutrition interventions on caregiver-reported antibiotic use in Bangladesh and Kenya, longitudinally measured at three timepoints among birth cohorts (ages 3-28 months) in a cluster-randomized trial. Over 50% of children used antibiotics at least once in the 90 days preceding data collection. In Bangladesh, the prevalence of antibiotic use was 10-14% lower in groups receiving WSH (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.90 (0.82-0.99)), nutrition (PR = 0.86 (0.78-0.94)), and nutrition+WSH (PR = 0.86 (0.79-0.93)) interventions. The prevalence of using antibiotics multiple times was 26-35% lower in intervention arms. Reductions were largest when the birth cohort was younger. In Kenya, interventions did not affect antibiotic use. In this work, we show that improving WSH and nutrition can reduce antibiotic use. Studies should assess whether such reductions translate to reduced antimicrobial resistance."

Some recent results suggest that GP-derived extracts could be promising additives in food, specially recommended for low-salt diets. The hypothesis tested in this paper is that the regular consumption of GP-derived seasonings could help in the control of hypertension and glycaemia. Methods: A randomized intervention study (6 weeks) was performed in high-risk cardiovascular subjects (n = 17) and in healthy subjects (n = 12) that were randomly allocated into intervention (2 g day(-1) of GP seasoning) or control (no seasoning consumed) groups. Blood samples, faeces, urine and blood pressure (BP) were taken at the baseline and at the end of the intervention. Faecal samples were analysed for microbiota composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and microbial-derived metabolites (short chain fatty acids and phenolic metabolites). Results: Among the clinical parameters studied, BP and fasting blood glucose significantly decreased (p < 0.05) after the seasoning intervention, but not for the control group. Notably, application of a novel approach based on ASV (Amplicon Sequence Variant) co-occurrence networks allowed us to identify some bacterial communities whose relative abundances were related with metadata. Conclusion: Our primary findings suggest that GP-seasoning may help in the modulation of cardiometabolic risk factors, mainly in the early stages. Furthermore, it evidences modulation of gut microbiota and functional bacterial communities by grape pomace, which might mediate the cardiometabolic effects of this by-product."

However, the safety and efficacy of postbiotics for preventing RTIs in preterm infants is not yet established. METHODS: We conducted a pilot double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the heat-killed lactic acid bacterium Pediococcus acidilactici K15 in 41 preterm infants born at <36 weeks of gestation and discharged from the NICU at Chiba University Hospital. RESULTS: Following once-daily K15 or placebo treatment for one year, no significant differences were found in the mean number of febrile days (4.5 [1.5-7.4] days vs. 6.6 [2.6-10.5] days). The subgroup analysis showed that the effect of treatment on the number of febrile days was more prominent in the K15 group than in the placebo group, among children with older siblings. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples illustrated that the genus Faecalimonas was enriched in the K15 group, potentially promoting butyrate production by butyrate-producing bacteria. No adverse events were found to be associated with K15 intake. CONCLUSION: There were no clear data to show the effectiveness of K15 in preventing fever and RTIs in preterm babies during infancy. A larger clinical trial is warranted."

There were no differences in clinical characteristics and gut colonization between both groups. In the responder group, there were significantly lower levels of five metabolites before beginning of the intervention: lactate, choline, ethanol, creatine, and formate. The fecal calprotectin level did not differ between groups prior to the intervention, but its level was significantly lower after intervention in the responder group. Possibly, the responder group with a ""metabolic niche"", including lower level of metabolites, especially lactate, that are potential products of Lactobacillus genus, would determine the response to probiotic treatment. These findings need to be confirmed, but identification of some differences in the fecal metabolomics and the calprotectin level suggests that further studies are warranted."

There is growing evidence demonstrating that theory-driven water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions are likely to yield greater behavior change than those based on health education alone. The Cholera Hospital-Based Intervention for 7-Days (CHoBI7) mobile health (mHealth) program is a theory-driven WASH intervention initially delivered to a diarrhea patient by a health promoter during a health facility visit and reinforced through weekly voice and text messages. In the recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the CHoBI7-mHealth program in Bangladesh, this intervention significantly reduced diarrheal disease and stunting, and increased handwashing with soap and stored drinking water quality over the 12-month program period. The aim of this study was to assess the underlying mechanism of change of this intervention. Handwashing with soap was measured by 5-hour structured observation. Stored drinking water quality was assessed by the presence of Escherichia coli during unannounced spot checks. Psychosocial factors were measured among 1,468 participants in the CHoBI7-mHealth RCT. Perceived susceptibility, response efficacy, self-efficacy, dirt reactivity, and diarrhea knowledge were mediators of the CHoBI7-mHealth program's effect on stored drinking water quality at the 1-week follow-up. Self-efficacy, response efficacy, and diarrhea knowledge were mediators of the intervention's effect on handwashing with soap habit maintenance and stored drinking water quality at the 12-month follow-up. This study demonstrates how theory-driven approaches for intervention design can facilitate WASH behavior change."

We assessed the efficacy and safety of faecal microbiota transplantation using standardised anaerobic cultivated human intestinal microbiome (ACHIM) as a novel treatment option for patients with systemic sclerosis and symptomatic lower gastrointestinal tract involvement. METHODS: In this phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial done at four university hospitals in Norway, we enrolled adults aged 18-85 years with systemic sclerosis and moderate-to-severe lower gastrointestinal tract symptoms (bloating or diarrhoea). Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to intestinal infusions of placebo or ACHIM at weeks 0 and 2, stratified by worst symptom (bloating or diarrhoea). The primary endpoint was change in worst lower gastrointestinal tract symptom (bloating or diarrhoea) from week 0 to week 12, measured using the University of California Los Angeles Scleroderma Clinical Trial Consortium Gastrointestinal Tract 2.0 scoring system in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 12 in all participants who received at least one infusion. A person with lived experience of systemic sclerosis was involved in the study planning and conduct. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04300426. FINDINGS: Between Sept 24, 2020, and Jan 14, 2022, 67 participants were enrolled and randomly allocated to placebo (n=34) or ACHIM (n=33). Mean age was 58.91 years (SD 11.59). 62 (93%) of 67 participants were women, five (7%) were men, and 50 (75%) were anti-centromere antibody positive. Change in worst lower gastrointestinal tract symptom from week 0 to week 12 did not differ between participants who received ACHIM (-0.13, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.11) and participants who received placebo (-0.33, -0.57 to -0.09; average marginal effect 0.20, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.52; p=0.22). Adverse events, mostly mild and short-lived gastrointestinal tract symptoms, were reported by 16 (48%) of 33 participants in the ACHIM group and 19 (56%) of 34 in the placebo group. During gastroscopy, one participant had a duodenal perforation. INTERPRETATION: Faecal microbiota transplantation with ACHIM was well tolerated in participants with systemic sclerosis but did not result in an improvement in lower gastrointestinal tract symptoms.

AIM: To evaluate the application effect of a new anti-reflux water injection tube device in preventing the contamination of endoscopy water injection bottles. METHODS: A total of 520 cases received gastrointestinal endoscopy examination were included. Patients were randomly divided into the experimental and control group. The experimental group used the anti-reflux injection tube device to assist with water injection, and the control group used the ordinary delivery tube. After every five cases of gastrointestinal endoscopy, water from the injection bottles was collected. Visual inspection, crystalline violet staining, microbial culture, and microbial species analysis were performed to analyze the contamination state of the water samples. RESULTS: The contamination rate in the experimental group was 5.66%, significantly lower than 76.47% in the control group. Crystalline violet staining confirmed that microorganisms existed in contaminated water samples. Microbiological culture results showed that the experimental group's undetectable rate of bacteria and fungi was 100%, significantly higher than that of the control group (19.61% for bacteria and 25.49% for fungi). The mean values of the total bacterial and fungal colonies of the control samples were 9.80 x 10(6) cfu/ml and 9.18 x 10(6) cfu/ml, respectively. The microbial species in the contaminated samples of the control group were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSION: The anti-reflux water injection tube device can effectively prevent the contamination of the endoscopy water injection bottles caused by the reflux of the ordinary water supply tube."

Originally, we had randomised 90 geographical clusters in Dhaka slums in Bangladesh in equal numbers (1:1:1) to a two-dose regimen of OCV alone (targeted to people aged 1 year or older), a two-dose regimen of OCV plus a water-sanitation-hygiene (WASH) intervention, or no intervention. There was no masking of group assignment. The WASH intervention conferred little additional protection to OCV and was discontinued at 2 years of follow-up. Surveillance for severe cholera was continued for 4 years. Because of the short duration and effect of the WASH intervention, we combined the two OCV intervention groups. The primary outcomes were OCV overall protection (protection of all members of the intervention clusters) and total protection (protection of individuals who got vaccinated in the intervention clusters) against severe cholera, which we assessed by multivariable survival models appropriate for cluster-randomised trials. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01339845. FINDINGS: The study was done between April 17, 2011, and Nov 1, 2015. 268 896 participants were present at the time of the first dose, with 188 206 in the intervention group and 80 690 in the control group. OCV coverage of the two groups receiving OCV was 66% (123 659 of 187 214 participants). During 4 years of follow-up, 441 first episodes of severe cholera were detected (243 episodes in the vaccinated groups and as 198 episodes in the unvaccinated group). Overall OCV protection was 36% (95% CI 19 to 49%) and total OCV protection was 46% (95% CI 32 to 58). Cumulative total vaccine protection was notably lower for people vaccinated before the age of 5 years (24%; -30 to 56) than for people vaccinated at age 5 years or older (49%; 35 to 60), although the differences in protection for the two age groups were not significant (p=0.3308). Total vaccine protection dropped notably (p=0.0115) after 3 years in children vaccinated at 1-4 years of age. INTERPRETATION: These findings provide further evidence of long-term effectiveness of killed whole-cell OCV, and therefore further support for the use of killed whole-cell OCVs to control endemic cholera, but indicate that protection is shorter-lived in children vaccinated before the age of 5 years than in people vaccinated at the age of 5 years or older.

"Minimal Effects of Medium-Chain Triglyceride Supplementation on the Intestinal Microbiome Composition of Premature Infants: A Single-Center Pilot Study.","Romo JA||Arsenault AB||Laforce-Nesbitt SS||Bliss JM||Kumamoto CA","Nutrients","10.3390/nu14102159","14","10","2022","Compared to term infants, the microbiota of preterm infants is less diverse and often enriched for potential pathogens (e.g., members of the family Enterobacteriaceae). Additionally, antibiotics are frequently given to preterm infants, further destabilizing the microbiota and increasing the risk of fungal infections. In a previous communication, our group showed that supplementation of the premature infant diet with medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil reduced the fungal burden of Candida spp. in the gastrointestinal tract. The objective of this study was to determine whether MCT supplementation impacts the bacterial component of the microbiome. Pre-term infants (n = 17) receiving enteral feedings of either infant formula (n = 12) or human milk (n = 5) were randomized to MCT supplementation (n = 9) or no supplementation (n = 8). Fecal samples were taken at randomization and prior to MCT supplementation (Week 0), on days 5-7 (Week 1) and day 21 (Week 3). After DNA extraction from samples, the QIIME2 pipeline was utilized to measure community diversity and composition (genera and phyla). Our findings show that MCT supplementation did not significantly alter microbiota diversity or composition in the gastrointestinal tract. Importantly, there were no significant changes in the family Enterobacteriaceae, suggesting that MCT supplementation did not enrich for potential pathogens. MCT holds promise as a therapeutic intervention for reducing fungal colonization without significant impact on the bacterial composition of the host gastrointestinal tract."

A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using data pooled from two randomized trials to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of once-daily amikacin liposome inhalation suspension (ALIS) in patients with treatment-refractory NTM lung disease. METHODS: In phase 2 (TR02-112) and phase 3 (CONVERT) studies, patients with sputum cultures positive for Mycobacterium avium complex (both studies) or M. abscessus (TR02-112) despite >/= 6 months of guideline-based therapy were treated with once-daily ALIS 590 mg. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (28 Japanese; 25 White) were assessed. At baseline and  approximately  6 months after daily dosing, median maximum concentration (C(max)) was < 2 mg/L and median area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-24)) was < 20 mg.h/L, suggesting low systemic exposure at both time points. Exposure estimates were similar between Japanese and White patients. The median unchanged amikacin fraction excreted in urine was < 10% of inhaled dose throughout the TR02-112 study, indicating that relatively small amounts reached systemic circulation. Median t(1/2) was 5.5 h. Amikacin concentrations were much higher in sputum than in serum, demonstrating the ability to achieve higher drug concentration at the site of infection. Median sputum amikacin concentrations in the CONVERT study were high at 1-4 h postdose (range 242-426 mug/g) and decreased by 8 h (median 7 mug/g). CONCLUSIONS: Systemic exposure to amikacin in serum and urine following once-daily ALIS administration in patients with treatment-refractory NTM lung disease was notably lower than that previously reported for parenteral amikacin.

"Efficacy of Xiyanping in the Treatment of Elderly Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Its Effect on the Expression of GDF-15 and HIF-1alpha in Serum.","Wang JX||Zhang Y||Wang SF||Li J||Li PC","Computational and mathematical methods in medicine","10.1155/2022/6193110","2022",NA,"2022","BACKGROUND: COPD is a chronic respiratory disease with a long course and recurrent characteristics. According to relevant statistics, the global incidence of COPD is more than 30%, which seriously affects the life of patients and endangers their health. OBJECTIVE: To observe the curative effect of Xiyanping in elderly patients with COPD and its influence on the expressions of growth differentiation GDF-15 and HIF-1alpha in serum. METHODS: From August 2019 to December 2021, 86 elderly patients with acute exacerbation of COPD were admitted to our hospital. As the research objects, they were divided into the control group (n = 43) and the observation group (n = 43) randomly. The control group received the conventional treatment, while the observation group got Xiyanping on the basis of the control group. The differences in the duration of antibiotic use, expectoration, hospital stays, adverse reactions and serum-related factors, blood routine, pulmonary function, airway hyperreactivity index, COPD assessment test (CAT) score, and Borg score were made a comparison between them. RESULTS: On the 3rd and 7th days after being treated, the sputum excretion in them was higher than before, but on the 3rd day of treatment, the sputum excretion in the observation group was higher than that in the control group, while on the 7th day of treatment, the sputum excretion was lower than that in the control group with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05). Before treatment, the serum-related factors and blood routine indexes between them were similar (P > 0.05). After treatment, GDF-15, HIF-1alpha, CXCL12, TNF-alpha, IL-8, TGF-beta, WBC, and NEU in them were significantly lower than before, and the values in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05). There was no difference in the related indexes of pulmonary function and airway hyperreactivity between them before treatment. After being treated, FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC in them were significantly higher than those before treatment. The airway resistance and lung compliance of the two groups at exhalation and inspiration were significantly lower than before, and the values in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). There was no difference in CAT and Borg scores between them before treatment. After treatment, the CAT score and Borg score of these patients were significantly lower than those before treatment, and the value of the observation group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.05). The duration of antibiotic use and length of stay in the observation group were significantly shorter than those of the control group, while the incidence of adverse reactions was not statistically significantly different compared with the control group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Xiyanping can improve pulmonary function of elderly patients with acute exacerbation of COPD, reduce the response of airway hyperreactivity, and promote the excretion of sputum."
"Effect of probiotics on gut microbiome in patients with administration of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis: A randomized controlled study.","Kaku N||Matsumoto N||Sasaki D||Tsuda K||Kosai K||Uno N||Morinaga Y||Tagami A||Adachi S||Hasegawa H||Osaki M||Yanagihara K","Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy","10.1016/j.jiac.2020.03.008","26","8","2020","Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) is recommended for the prevention of surgical site infections. However, there is a concern about adverse effects of SAP, such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). To prevent AAD, administration of probiotics has been investigated. Although recent advances in next-generation sequencing makes it possible to analyze the gut microbiome, the effect of probiotics on the gut microbiome in the patients with SAP remains unknown. To test a hypothesis that SAP influences the gut microbiome and probiotics prevent the influence, a randomized controlled study was conducted with patients who underwent spinal surgery at Nagasaki University Hospital. After obtaining informed consent, the patients were automatically classified into the non-probiotics group and the probiotics group. In the probiotics group, the patients took 1 g of Enterococcus faecium 129 BIO 3B-R, 3 times a day on postoperative days (PODs) 1-5. The feces of all patients were sampled before administration of SAP and on PODs 5 and 10. We compared alpha and beta diversity and differential abundance analysis of the gut microbiome before and after SAP. During the study period, a total of 33 patients were evaluated, comprising 17 patients in the non-probiotics group and 16 in the probiotics group. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding patient characteristics. In alpha and beta diversity, there were no significant differences among all combinations. In differential abundance analysis at operational taxonomic unit level, Streptococcus gallolyticus and Roseburia were significantly increased in the non-probiotics group and significantly decreased in the probiotics group."
"Impact of probiotics supplement on the gut microbiota in neonates with antibiotic exposure: an open-label single-center randomized parallel controlled study.","Zhong H||Wang XG||Wang J||Chen YJ||Qin HL||Yang R","World journal of pediatrics : WJP","10.1007/s12519-021-00443-y","17","4","2021","BACKGROUND: Antibiotics, a common strategy used for neonatal infection, show consistent effect on the gut microbiota of neonates. Supplementation with probiotics has become increasingly popular in mitigating the loss of the gut microbiota. However, no clear consensus recommending the use of probiotics in the infection of neonates currently exists. This study examined the effects of probiotics on the gut microbiota of infectious neonates when used concurrently with or during the recovery period following antibiotic therapy. METHODS: Fifty-five full-term neonates diagnosed with neonatal infections were divided into the following groups: NI (no intervention, antibiotic therapy only), PCA (probiotics used concurrently with antibiotics), and PAA (probiotics used after antibiotics). The NI group received antibiotic treatment (piperacillin-tazobactam) for 1 week and the PCA group received antibiotic treatment together with probiotics (Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Enterococcus faecalis) for 1 week. The PAA group received antibiotic treatment for 1 week followed by probiotics for 1 week. Fecal samples were collected at four time nodes: newborn, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 42 days after birth. The composition of the gut microbiota was determined by the high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons. RESULTS: Antibiotic exposure was found to dramatically alter gut microbiota, with a significant decrease of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. The use of probiotics did not restore the overall diversity of the gut microbiota. However, using probiotics simultaneously with the antibiotics was found to be beneficial for the gut microbiota as compared to delaying the use of probiotics to follow treatment with antibiotics, particularly in promoting the abundance of Bifidobacterium. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the early use of probiotics may have a potential ability to remodel the gut microbiota during recovery from antibiotic treatment. However, further study is required to fully understand the long-term effects including the clinical benefits."

OBJECTIVES: To assess DAV132 safety and biological efficacy in patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An open-label, randomized [stratification: fluoroquinolone (FQ) indication] multicentre trial comparing DAV132 (7.5 g, 3 times a day, orally) with No-DAV132 in hospitalized patients requiring 5-21 day treatment with FQs and at risk of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). FQ and DAV132 were started simultaneously, DAV132 was administered for 48 h more, and patients were followed up for 51 days. The primary endpoint was the rate of adverse events (AEs) independently adjudicated as related to DAV132 and/or FQ. The planned sample size of 260 patients would provide a 95% CI of +/-11.4%, assuming a 33% treatment-related AE rate. Plasma and faecal FQ concentrations, intestinal microbiota diversity, intestinal colonization with C. difficile, MDR bacteria and yeasts, and ex vivo resistance to C. difficile faecal colonization were assessed. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-three patients (median age 71 years; 96% with chronic comorbidity) were included (No-DAV132, n = 120; DAV132, n = 123). DAV132- and/or FQ-related AEs did not differ significantly: 18 (14.8%) versus 13 (10.8%) in DAV132 versus No-DAV132 patients (difference 3.9%; 95% CI: -4.7 to 12.6). Day 4 FQ plasma levels were unaffected. DAV132 was associated with a >98% reduction in faecal FQ levels (Day 4 to end of treatment; P < 0.001), less impaired microbiota diversity (Shannon index; P = 0.003), increased ex vivo resistance to C. difficile colonization (P = 0.0003) and less frequent FQ-induced VRE acquisition (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In FQ-treated hospitalized patients, DAV132 was well tolerated, and FQ plasma concentrations unaffected. DAV132 preserved intestinal microbiota diversity and C. difficile colonization resistance."

Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) carries unacceptable mortality, particularly if accompanied by infection or medical complications, including enteropathy. We evaluated four interventions for malnutrition enteropathy in a multi-centre phase II multi-arm trial in Zambia and Zimbabwe and completed in 2021. The purpose of this trial was to identify therapies which could be taken forward into phase III trials. Children of either sex were eligible for inclusion if aged 6-59 months and hospitalised with SAM (using WHO definitions: WLZ <-3, and/or MUAC <11.5 cm, and/or bilateral pedal oedema), with written, informed consent from the primary caregiver. We randomised 125 children hospitalised with complicated SAM to 14 days treatment with (i) bovine colostrum (n = 25), (ii) N-acetyl glucosamine (n = 24), (iii) subcutaneous teduglutide (n = 26), (iv) budesonide (n = 25) or (v) standard care only (n = 25). The primary endpoint was a composite of faecal biomarkers (myeloperoxidase, neopterin, alpha(1)-antitrypsin). Laboratory assessments, but not treatments, were blinded. Per-protocol analysis used ANCOVA, adjusted for baseline biomarker value, sex, oedema, HIV status, diarrhoea, weight-for-length Z-score, and study site, with pre-specified significance of P < 0.10. Of 143 children screened, 125 were randomised. Teduglutide reduced the primary endpoint of biomarkers of mucosal damage (effect size -0.89 (90% CI: -1.69,-0.10) P = 0.07), while colostrum (-0.58 (-1.4, 0.23) P = 0.24), N-acetyl glucosamine (-0.20 (-1.01, 0.60) P = 0.67), and budesonide (-0.50 (-1.33, 0.33) P = 0.32) had no significant effect. All interventions proved safe. This work suggests that treatment of enteropathy may be beneficial in children with complicated malnutrition.

In common enterocolitis, probiotic organisms, including Lactobacilli, are effective in treating diarrhea. A new species, Lactobacillus plantarum (LRCC5310), which was shown to inhibit the adherence and proliferation of rotavirus in the small intestine through animal experiments, was investigated for the efficacy and safety of patients with rotaviral enteritis. METHODS: LRCC5310 (Group I) and control (Group II) groups consisting of children who were hospitalized for rotaviral enteritis were compared, and the medical records of patients (Group III) who were hospitalized for rotaviral enteritis during the same study period were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical symptoms were compared and stool samples were collected to compare changes in virus multiplication between Groups I and II. RESULTS: Groups I, II, and III comprised 15, 8, and 27 children, respectively. There were no differences in clinical information among the groups at admission. In Group I, a statistically significant improvement was noted in the number of patients with diarrhea, number of defecation events on Day 3, and total diarrhea period as opposed to Group II (P = .033, P = .003, and P = .012, respectively). The improvement of Vesikari score in Group I was greater than that in the other groups (P = .076, P = .061, and P = .036, respectively). Among rotavirus genotypes, 9 (22.5%) strains and 8 (20.0%) strains belonged to the G9P8 and G1P8 genotypes, respectively. The virus reduction effect, as confirmed via stool specimens, was also greater in Group I. No significant side effects were noted in infants. CONCLUSION: LRCC5310 improved clinical symptoms, including diarrhea and Vesikari score, and inhibited viral proliferation in rotaviral gastroenteritis."

Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) is one key application of such treatment. Another emerging application of interest is reducing antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) and organisms (AROs). In this study, we investigated fecal specimens from a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b study of microbiota-based investigational drug RBX2660. Patients were administered either placebo, 1 dose of RBX2660 and 1 placebo, or 2 doses of RBX2660 via enema and longitudinally tracked for changes in their microbiome and antibiotic resistome. RESULTS: All patients exhibited significant recovery of gut microbiome diversity and a decrease of ARG relative abundance during the first 7 days post-treatment. However, the microbiome and resistome shifts toward average configurations from unperturbed individuals were more significant and longer-lasting in RBX2660 recipients compared to placebo. We quantified microbiome and resistome modification by RBX2660 using a novel ""transplantation index"" metric. We identified taxonomic and metabolic features distinguishing the baseline microbiome of non-transplanted patients and taxa specifically enriched during the process of transplantation. We elucidated the correlation between resistome and taxonomic transplantations and post-treatment dynamics of patient-specific and RBX2660-specific ARGs. Whole genome sequencing of AROs cultured from RBX2660 product and patient samples indicate ARO eradication in patients via RBX2660 administration, but also, to a lesser extent, introduction of RBX2660-derived AROs. CONCLUSIONS: Through shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we elucidated the effects of RBX2660 in the microbiome and resistome. Antibiotic discontinuation alone resulted in significant recovery of gut microbial diversity and reduced ARG relative abundance, but RBX2660 administration more rapidly and completely changed the composition of patients' microbiome, resistome, and ARO colonization by transplanting RBX2660 microbiota into the recipients. Although ARGs and AROs were transmitted through RBX2660, the resistome post-RBX2660 more closely resembled that of the administered product-a proxy for the donor-than an antibiotic perturbed state.

METHODS: We conducted a trial of water supply infrastructure improvements in Uvira (DRC). Our primary objective was to estimate the relationship between a composite index of water service quality and the monthly number of suspected cholera cases admitted to treatment facilities and, as a secondary analysis, the number of cases confirmed by rapid diagnostic tests. Other exposures included the quantity of supplied water and service continuity. We used Poisson generalised linear models with generalised estimating equations to estimate incidence rate ratios. FINDINGS: Associations between suspected cholera incidence and water service quality (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73-1.01), quantity (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62-1.02) and continuity (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.77-0.86) were estimated. The magnitudes of the associations were similar between confirmed cholera incidence and water service quality (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.97), quantity (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.94) and continuity (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69-0.81). These results suggest that an additional 5 L/user/day or 1.2 hour per day of water production could reduce confirmed cholera by 24% (95% CI 6-39%) and 25% (95% CI 19-31%), respectively. INTERPRETATION: Ensuring a sufficient and continuous piped water supply may substantially reduce the burden of endemic cholera and diarrhoeal diseases but evaluating this rigorously is challenging.

Nutritional interventions may enhance resistance to infectious diseases or help to reduce clinical symptoms. Here, we investigated whether a whey protein concentrate (WPC) could decrease diarrheagenic Escherichia coli-induced changes in reported stool frequency and gastrointestinal complaints in a double-blind, parallel 4-week intervention study. Subjects were randomly assigned to a whey hydrolysate placebo group, a low-dose WPC group or a high-dose WPC group. After 2 weeks of consumption, subjects (n = 121) were orally infected with a high dose of live but attenuated diarrheagenic E. coli (strain E1392/75-2A; 1E10 colony-forming units). Subjects recorded information on stool consistency and the frequency and severity of symptoms in an online diary. The primary outcome parameters were a change in stool frequency (stools per day) and a change in Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) diarrhea score between the first and second days after infection. Neither dose of the whey protein concentrate in the dietary treatment affected the E. coli-induced increase in stool frequency or GSRS diarrhea score compared to placebo treatment. The composition of the microbiota shifted between the start of the study and after two weeks of consumption of the products, but no differences between the intervention groups were observed, possibly due to dietary guidelines that subjects had to adhere to during the study. In conclusion, consumption of the whey protein concentrate by healthy adults did not reduce diarrhea scores in an E. coli infection model compared to a whey hydrolysate placebo control."

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We assembled a large prospective cohort within a cluster randomised trial evaluating the effectiveness of oral cholera vaccine. Our dynamic cohort population (n=193 576) comprised individuals living in the 'non-intervention' clusters of the trial, and were followed over 4 years. This study was conducted in a dense urban slum community of Dhaka, Bangladesh and cholera surveillance was undertaken in 12 hospitals serving the study area. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: First severe cholera episode detected during follow-up period. METHODS: We applied a machine learning algorithm on a training subpopulation (n=96 943) to develop a binary ('better', 'not better') composite WASH variable predictive of severe cholera. The WASH rule was evaluated for performance in a separate validation subpopulation (n=96 633). Afterwards, we used Cox regression models to evaluate the association between 'better' WASH households and severe cholera risk over 4 years in the entire study population. RESULTS: The 'better' WASH rule found that water quality and access were the most significant factors associated with severe cholera risk. Members of 'better' WASH households, constituting one-third of the population, had a 47% reduced risk of severe cholera (95% CI: 29 to 69; p<0.001), after adjusting for covariates. The protective association between living in a 'better' WASH household and severe cholera persisted in all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Salutary existing household WASH practices were associated with a significantly reduced long-term risk of severe cholera in an urban slum of Dhaka. These findings suggest that WASH adaptations already practised in the community may be important for developing and implementing effective and sustainable cholera control programmes in similar settings.

Due to the multifaceted causes of undernutrition and the identified limitations of siloed nutrition programmes, improving the delivery of integrated water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH) and nutrition programming could improve child health. METHODS: We conducted a cluster randomised trial in western Kenya to assess the impact on household behaviours of a novel, theory-informed and integrated WASH and nutrition intervention delivered through care groups as compared with the standard care group approach. We developed an intervention targeting practices relating to food hygiene, mealtime and feeding, and compound cleanliness, each using various behavioural change techniques to influence the uptake of targeted behaviours. Prespecified behavioural outcomes were verified through direct observation, 24 hours recall, and self-reported picture-based methods. RESULTS: Compared with control households, a greater proportion of intervention households had a hygienic food preparation area (Risk double difference (RDD) 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.96), had stored food hygienically (RDD 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.00), had a functional handwashing station (RDD 0.64, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.74), provided a safe space for their child to play (RDD 0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.96), and who fed their children thickened porridge (RDD 0.56, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.63) at endline. The proportion of children 6-24 months in intervention households consuming a sufficient diversity of foods (RDD 0.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.04) was higher than in control households; however, there was a non-significant increase in the percentage of pregnant and lactating women receiving an adequate diversity of foods in their diets (RDD 0.86, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.05) among intervention compared with control households at endline. CONCLUSION: Our integrated WASH and nutrition intervention resulted in important changes in behaviours. This theory-informed intervention could be added to existing care group programmes to considerable advantage."
"A calorie-restricted diet enriched with tree nuts and peanuts reduces the expression of CX3CR1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with coronary artery disease.","Ghanavati M||Nasrollahzadeh J","International journal for vitamin and nutrition research. Internationale Zeitschrift fur Vitamin- und Ernahrungsforschung.

This study was conducted to determine the effects of a low-calorie diet with and without nuts on some gut bacterial abundance, metabolic markers, and gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in stable coronary artery disease patients with overweight or obesity. Methods: Overweight or obese patients with stable coronary artery disease of both genders were randomly allocated to a nut-free calorie-restricted diet as 25% of energy deficit (CRD) or a CRD enriched with 39-60 g/d of mixed nuts (CRDEN) for 8 weeks (32 patients in CRD and 35 patients in CRDEN). Mixed nuts consisted of equal amounts of unsalted pistachios, almonds, and peanuts. Microbiota analysis was performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method on feces collected before and after the intervention, using primers targeting 16S ribosomal DNA of 4 different bacterial genera, including Bacteroides, Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus. We examined the plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, adiponectin as well as expression of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) in PBMCs. Results: A significant reduction in expression of CX3CR1 (p=0.04) and a tendency to lower expression of TLR4 in PBMCs (p=0.06) was observed in the CRDEN group at the end of the study compared to the CRD group. The abundance of fecal Prevotella also tended to increase in CRDEN compared to the CRD group (p=0.06). Plasma insulin and adiponectin had no significant changes. There was a positive correlation between fecal Prevotella abundance and plasma adiponectin at baseline (r=0.315, p=0.015) and the end of the study (r=0.380, p=0.003). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the inclusion of mixed tree nuts and peanuts in a low-calorie diet for 8 weeks led to a lower CX3CR expression in PBMCs in a cohort of overweight or obese patients with stable CAD. This finding provides another beneficial effect of diet supplemented with nuts on factors associated with inflammation.

We investigated whether halving antibiotic courses would reduce antibiotic-resistance genes (ARG) in the intestinal microbiomes of patients treated for gram-negative bacteraemia. METHODS: This nested prospective cohort study included adult patients hospitalized at Geneva University Hospitals (Switzerland) participating in the PIRATE randomized trial assessing non-inferiority of shorter antibiotic courses (7 versus 14 days) for gram-negative bacteraemia ('cases') and, simultaneously, hospitalized patients with similar demography and comorbidity yet no antibiotic therapy ('controls'). Stool was collected from case and control patients on days 7, 14, 30 and 90 after antibiotic initiation (day 1) and days 7 and 14 after admission, respectively, and analysed by whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing. The primary outcome was ARG abundance at day 30; secondary outcomes included microbiota-species composition and clustering over time. FINDINGS: Forty-five patients and 11 controls were included and evaluable; ARG analyses were conducted on the 29 per-protocol patients receiving 7 (+/-2) days or 14 (+/-3) days of antibiotic therapy. At day 30, ARGs were not detected at similar abundance in patients receiving 7 and 14 days (median counts/million [mCPM]: 96 versus [vs] 71; p=.38). By day 30, total ARG content between both groups was not significantly different from that of controls at D7 (362 and 370 mCPM vs 314 mCPM, p=.24 and 0.19). There were no significant differences amongst antibiotic-treated patients at any timepoint in bacterial diversity or clustering, but Shannon species diversity was significantly reduced compared to controls through day 14 (median 3.12 and 3.24 in the 7-day and 14-day groups vs 3.61 [controls]; p=.04 and 0.012). Patients treated for 14 days had reduced faecal phage content during and after therapy compared to other patient groups. INTERPRETATION: Reducing antibiotic durations by half did not result in decreased abundance of ARGs in patients treated for gram-negative bacteraemia, nor did it improve microbiota species diversity.

We assessed the effectiveness of thermal and chemical interventions on sinks contaminated with MDRO in the hospital setting. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional assessment of MDRO contamination of sinks and toilets in 26 clinical wards of a tertiary care hospital. MDRO-contaminated sink traps were then replaced and randomized (1:1:1) to receive chemical (sodium hypochlorite), thermal disinfection (steam), or no intervention. Interventions were repeated weekly for 4 weeks. Sinks were resampled 7 days after the last intervention. The primary outcome was the proportion of decontaminated sinks. MDROs of interest were extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, and non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional assessment, at least one MDRO was identified in 258 (36%) of the 748 samples and in 91 (47%) of the 192 water sources. In total, 57 (42%) of the 137 sinks and 34 (62%) of the 55 toilets were contaminated with 137 different MDROs. The most common MDRO were ESBL Enterobacterales (69%, 95/137), followed by Verona Integron-Borne Metallo-beta-Lactamase (VIM) carbapenemase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9%, 12/137) and Citrobacter spp. (6%, 5/137). In the nested randomized trial, five of the 16 sinks (31%) in the chemical disinfection group were decontaminated, compared with 8 of 18 (44%) in the control group (OR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.14-2.32) and 9 of 17 (53%) in the thermal disinfection group (OR 1.40; 95% CI, 0.37-5.32). DISCUSSION: Our study failed to demonstrate an added benefit of repeated chemical or thermal disinfection, beyond changing sink traps, in the MDRO decontamination of sinks. Routine chlorine-based disinfection of sinks may need to be reconsidered."
"Azathioprine Plus Exclusive Enteral Nutrition Versus Azathioprine Monotherapy for the Prevention of Postoperative Recurrence in Patients with Crohn's Disease: An Open-Label, Single-Centre, Randomized Controlled Trial.","Duan M||Lu M||Diao Y||Cao L||Wu Q||Liu Y||Gong J||Zhu W||Li Y","Journal of Crohn's & colitis","10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjae015","18","7","2024","BACKGROUND: Azathioprine [AZA] effectively prevents postoperative endoscopic recurrence [ER] in Crohn's disease [CD]. However, the efficacy of AZA emerges after 3 months. Exclusive enteral nutrition [EEN] can maintain remission in CD. The present trial investigates whether AZA plus postoperative 3-month EEN is superior to AZA alone in preventing ER of CD. METHODS: In total, 84 high-risk CD patients undergoing intestinal resection received AZA alone or AZA plus 3 months of EEN [AZA + EEN] postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the rate of ER at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included the rate of ER at 3 months, clinical recurrence [CR], CD activity index [CDAI] scores, faecal calprotectin [FC], and C-reactive protein [CRP]. Quality of life was assessed using Short Form-36 [SF-36] and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire [IBDQ]. RESULTS: Patients in the AZA + EEN group exhibited significantly lower rates of ER compared to the AZA group at both 12 months (33.3% [13/39] vs 63.2% [24/38], P = 0.009) and 3 months (8.6% [3/35] vs 28.1% [9/32], P = 0.037) post-surgery. The rates of CR between the two groups at 3 and 12 months were similar. CDAI scores, FC, albumin level, and CRP were all comparable between the two groups. Quality of life was significantly higher in the AZA group than in the AZA + EEN group at 3 months but became comparable from 5 to 12 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION: In high-risk CD patients, combining AZA with postoperative 3-month EEN reduces 1-year ER but may temporarily impact quality of life. Further large-scale, long-term studies are warranted.

This first-in-human trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of GST-HG131 in healthy Chinese subjects. This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase Ia clinical trial that was conducted in two parts. Part A was a single-ascending-dose (SAD; GST-HG131 10 30, 60, 100, 150, 200, 250 or 300 mg or placebo) study, which also assessed the food effect of GST-HG131 100 mg. Part B was a multiple-ascending-dose (MAD; GST-HG131 30, 60 or 100 mg or placebo BID) study. Tolerability assessments included adverse events, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests. PK analyses were conducted in blood, urine, and fecal samples. Single doses of GST-HG131 </= 300 mg and multiple doses of GST-HG131 </= 60 mg were generally safe and well tolerated; however, multiple dosing was stopped at GST-HG131 100 mg, as pre-defined stopping rules specified in the protocol were met (Grade II drug related AEs of nausea and dizziness in >50% of subjects). In the SAD study, median t(max) of GST-HG131 was 1-6 h, and t(1/2) ranged from 3.88 h to 14.3 h. PK parameters were proportional to dose. Exposure was reduced after food intake. In the MAD study, steady-state was attained on day 4, and there was no apparent plasma accumulation of GST-HG131 on day 7 (R(acc) < 1.5). In conclusion, GST-HG131 exhibited an acceptable safety profile in healthy subjects at single doses ranging from 10-300 mg and multiple doses (BID) ranging from 30-60 mg, and the MAD doses (30 mg and 60 mg BID) that potentially meet the therapeutic AUC requirements. These findings imply GST-HG131 has potential as a therapeutic option for CHB infection. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT04499443.)."

A recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) show that FMT may be considered early, defined as intervention during the first or second CDI episode. AIM: The aim was to investigate hospital costs of FMT as a complementary treatment compared with current standard care in patients with first or second CDI. FINDINGS: Compared with standard care for first or second CDI, patients randomised to FMT had euro1,645 lower hospital costs over 26 weeks owing to fewer admissions and hospital contacts and less medication use. In the sensitivity analyses, FMT remained cost-effective as long as the treatment cost of FMT stayed below approximately euro1,572 per component, corresponding to a total cost of FMT treatment (two components) of euro3,144. CONCLUSION: FMT was cost-effective with both lower costs and greater effectiveness than current standard care involving vancomycin monotherapy. The findings were robust to sensivity analyses, with a threshold cost for one FMT treatment consisting of two components of euro3,144."

Intestinal carriers are at increased risk of infection by these microorganisms. Decolonisation strategies with antibiotics have not obtained conclusive results. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could be an effective and safe strategy to decolonise intestinal carriers of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) but this hypothesis needs evaluation in appropriate clinical trials. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The KAPEDIS trial is a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2, superiority clinical trial of FMT for eradication of intestinal colonisation by KPC-Kp. One hundred and twenty patients with rectal colonisation by KPC-Kp will be randomised 1:1 to receive encapsulated lyophilised FMT or placebo. The primary outcome is KPC-Kp eradication at 30 days. Secondary outcomes are: (1) frequency of adverse events; (2) changes in KPC-Kp relative load within the intestinal microbiota at 7, 30 and 90 days, estimated by real-time quantitative PCR analysis of rectal swab samples and (3) rates of persistent eradication, KPC-Kp infection and crude mortality at 90 days. Participants will be monitored for adverse effects throughout the intervention.

"Impact of systemic probiotics as adjuncts to subgingival instrumentation on the oral-gut microbiota associated with periodontitis: A randomized controlled clinical trial.","de Oliveira AM||Lourenco TGB||Colombo APV","Journal of periodontology","10.1002/JPER.21-0078","93","1","2022","BACKGROUND: The oral-gut axis may be a route linking periodontal and systemic diseases. Probiotics could be an alternative for the treatment of microbial dysbiotic conditions, including periodontitis. This randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated the short-term efficacy of systemic probiotics adjunctive to subgingival instrumentation (SI) in promoting a better restoration of the oral-gut microbiotas and greater periodontal clinical outcome. METHODS: Systemically healthy adults with untreated periodontitis were recruited from a Dental School setting and allocated to receive SI plus placebo (n = 24) or probiotics (n = 24), one capsule/day for 30 days. Subgingival biofilm and stool were obtained at baseline and 2-months post-therapy for microbiological analyses by checkerboard and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Differences in all parameters between placebo (n = 23) and probiotics (n = 19) groups were assessed by non-parametric tests. RESULTS: Most subgingival species and alpha-diversity decreased after therapies (P <0.05), whereas gut composition/diversity were slightly or not affected by treatments. In parallel, significant clinical improvement (P <0.05) was similar between groups, although a trend for a higher proportion of poor responders in the placebo (60.8%) than the probiotic group (31.5%) was observed (P = 0.07). Strong correlations between oral and fecal species were found (P <0.01), and distinct species related to poor response for different therapies (P <0.05). Patients were classified into five periodontitis oral-gut microbial clusters, which correlated differently with attachment loss after therapies (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: Systemic probiotics combined with SI did not provide short-term additional clinical or microbiological benefits in the treatment of periodontitis; however, response to therapies seemed to correlate with distinct oral-gut microbial profiles."

So, the addition of alternative sweeteners to new fruit-based drinks could contribute to minimizing the incidence or severity of these pathologies. Nevertheless, current knowledge on the influence of these additives on the bioactive compounds present in these beverages is still scarce.new-onset hypertension, but few data were published in Asian. We aimed to investigate the association of lipid profiles with new-onset hypertension in a Chinese community-based non-hypertensive cohort without lipid-lowering treatment (n = 1802). METHODS AND RESULTS: Hence, to contribute to the understanding of this issue, the plasma concentration of phenolic compounds (anthocyanins and flavanones), after the ingestion of a new maqui-citrus-based beverage, supplemented with sucrose (natural high caloric), stevia (natural non-caloric), or sucralose (artificial non-caloric), was evaluated as evidence of their intestinal absorption and metabolism previous to renal excretion. The beverages were ingested by volunteers (n = 20) and the resulting phenolic metabolites in plasma were analyzed by UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS. A total of 13 metabolites were detected: caffeic acid sulfate, caffeic acid glucuronide, 3,4-dihydroxyfenylacetic, 3,4-dihydroxyfenylacetic sulfate. 3,4-dihydroxyfenylacetic acid di-sulfate, 3,4-dihydroxyfenylacetic di-glucuronide, 3,4-dihydroxyfenylacetic glucuronide-sulfate, trans-ferulic acid glucuronide, naringenin glucuronide, vanillic acid, vanillic acid sulfate, vanillic acid glucuronide-sulfate, and vanillic acid di-glucuronide, being recorded their maximum concentration after 30-60 min. CONCLUSION: In general, sucralose provided the greatest absorption value for most of these metabolites, followed by stevia. Due to this, the present study proposes sucralose and stevia (non-caloric sweeteners) as valuable alternatives to sucrose (high caloric sweetener), to avoid the augmented risk of several metabolic disorders."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of B. infantis NLS-SS on persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with CD following a long-term GFD. We conducted a randomised, cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in symptomatic adult CD patients on a GFD for at least two years. After one-week run-in, patients were randomised to B. infantis NLS-SS or placebo for 3 weeks with cross-over after a 2-week wash-out period. We estimated changes (Delta) in celiac symptom index (CSI) before and after treatment. Stool samples were collected for faecal microbiota analysis (16S rRNA sequencing). Gluten immunogenic peptide (GIP) excretion in stool and urine samples was measured at each study period. Eighteen patients were enrolled; six patients were excluded due violations in protocol. For patients with the highest clinical burden, CD symptoms were lower in probiotic than in placebo treatment (P=0.046). B. infantis and placebo treated groups had different microbiota profiles as assessed by beta diversity clustering. In probiotic treated groups, we observed an increase in abundance of B. infantis. Treatment with B. infantis was associated with decreased abundance of Ruminococcus sp. and Bifidobacterium adolescentis. GIP excretion in stools and urine was similar at each treatment period. There were no differences in adverse effects between the two groups. B. infantis NLS-SS improves specific CD symptoms in a subset of highly symptomatic treated patients (GFD). This is associated with a shift in stool microbiota profile. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03271138."
"A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Effects of Multi-Strain Synbiotic in Patients with Functional Diarrhea and High Fecal Calprotectin Levels: A Pilot Study.","Jung S||Kim KM||Youn SM||Kim KN","Nutrients","10.3390/nu14235017","14","23","2022","Synbiotics, including probiotics and prebiotics, are useful for patients with functional bowel disorders. However, which synbiotics are beneficial for patients with which diseases, especially those with functional diarrhea (FDr) with high fecal calprotectin levels, is currently unknown. FDr is an extension of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). Although fewer studies have been conducted on FDr compared to IBS-D, its importance is increasing as its prevalence increases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a synbiotic containing a mixture of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and its substrate, fructooligosaccharide, on bowel symptoms, fecal calprotectin levels, fecal microbiota, and safety in FDr patients with high fecal calprotectin levels. Forty patients were randomly assigned to either a synbiotic group or a placebo group. A total of 20 subjects in the synbiotic group and 19 subjects in the placebo group completed the study (8 weeks). Changes in FDr symptoms, fecal calprotectin levels, and gut microbiota were assessed during the intervention period. At 4 and 8 weeks, the number of bowel movements tended to increase in the synbiotic group, with a significant increase in the number of formed stools rather than loose stools (p < 0.05). Bowel movement satisfaction was significantly increased in the synbiotic group, but not in the placebo group. Intestinal flora analysis revealed that Lactobacillales at the order level was increased only in the synbiotic group at the end of the intervention. In contrast, at week 8 of the intervention, log-transformed fecal calprotectin levels were significantly decreased in the synbiotic group, although the change was not significantly different from that of the placebo group. These findings suggest that the intake of a multi-strain-containing synbiotic for 8 weeks could improve gut symptoms and the intestinal microenvironment of FDr patients with high fecal calprotectin levels."

We hypothesized that a MFGM-enriched milk beverage (MEB) would alleviate metabolic endotoxemia in metabolic syndrome (MetS) persons by improving gut barrier function and glucose tolerance. In a randomized crossover trial, MetS persons consumed for two-week period a controlled diet with MEB (2.3 g/d milk phospholipids) or a comparator beverage (COMP) formulated with soy phospholipid and palm/coconut oil. They then provided fasting blood and completed a high-fat/high-carbohydrate test meal challenge for evaluating postprandial metabolism and intestinal permeability. Participants had no adverse effects and achieved high compliance, and there were no between-trial differences in dietary intakes. Compared with COMP, fasting endotoxin, glucose, incretins, and triglyceride were unaffected by MEB. The meal challenge increased postprandial endotoxin, triglyceride, and incretins, but were unaffected by MEB. Insulin sensitivity; fecal calprotectin, myeloperoxidase, and short-chain fatty acids; and small intestinal and colonic permeability were also unaffected by MEB. This short-term study demonstrates that controlled administration of MEB in MetS persons does not affect gut barrier function, glucose tolerance, and other cardiometabolic health biomarkers, which contradicts observational evidence that full-fat milk heightens cardiometabolic risk.

The intake of polyphenol-rich foods is proposed as a promising strategy to positively affect the gut microbiota-immune system-intestinal barrier (IB) axis. In this context, we tested the hypothesis that a PR-dietary intervention would affect the presence of bacterial factors in the bloodstream of older adults. METHODS: We collected blood samples within a randomized, controlled, crossover intervention trial in which older volunteers (n = 51) received a polyphenol-enriched and a control diet. We quantified the presence of bacterial DNA in blood by qPCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene (16S; bacterial DNAemia). Blood DNA was taxonomically profiled via 16S sequencing. RESULTS: Higher blood 16S levels were associated with higher BMI and markers of IP, inflammation, and dyslipidemia. PR-intervention did not significantly change bacterial DNAemia in the older population (P = 0.103). Nonetheless, the beneficial changes caused by the polyphenol-enriched diet were greatest in participants with higher bacterial DNAemia, specifically in markers related to IP, inflammation and dyslipidemia, and in fecal bacterial taxa. Finally, we found that the bacterial DNA detected in blood mostly belonged to gamma-Proteobacteria, whose abundance significantly decreased after the polyphenol-rich diet in subjects with higher bacterial DNAemia at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that older subjects with higher bacterial DNAemia experienced a beneficial effect from a polyphenol-rich diet. Bacterial DNAemia may be a further relevant marker for the identification of target populations that could benefit more from a protective dietary treatment.

Biomarkers are needed to evaluate these changes in vivo, stratify an individual's risk, and evaluate the efficacy of interventions. MRI is an established biomarker of small bowel inflammation. PURPOSE: To characterize changes in the small bowel with quantitative MRI measures associated with increased permeability induced by indomethacin. STUDY TYPE: Prospective single-center, double-blind, two-way crossover provocation study. SUBJECTS: A provocation cohort (22 healthy volunteers) and intrasubject reproducibility cohort (8 healthy volunteers). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 2D balanced turbo field echo sequences to measure small bowel wall thickness, T(2) , and motility acquired at 3T. ASSESSMENT: Participants were randomized to receive indomethacin or placebo prior to assessment. After a minimum 2-week washout, measures were repeated with the alternative allocation. MR measures (wall thickness, T(2) , motility) at each study visit were compared to the reference standard 2-hour lactulose/mannitol urinary excretion ratio (LMR) test performed by a lab technician. All analyses were performed blind. STATISTICAL TESTS: Normality was tested (Shapiro-Wilk's test). Paired testing (Student's t-test or Wilcoxon) determined the significance of paired differences with indomethacin provocation. Pearson's correlation coefficient compared significant measures with indomethacin provocation to LMR. Intrasubject (intraclass correlation) and interrater variability (Bland-Altman) were assessed. RESULTS: Indomethacin provocation induced a significant increase in LMR compared to placebo (P < 0.05) and a significant increase in small bowel T(2) (0.12 seconds compared to placebo 0.07 seconds, P < 0.05). Small bowel wall thickness (P = 0.17) and motility (P = 0.149) showed no significant change. T(2) and LMR were positively correlated (r = 0.68, P < 0.05). T(2) measurements were robust to interobserver (intraclass correlation 0.89) and intrasubject variability (Bland-Altman bias of 0.005 seconds, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.04 to +0.05 seconds, and 0.0006 seconds, 95% CI -0.05 to +0.06 seconds). DATA CONCLUSION: MR measures of small bowel wall T(2) were significantly increased following indomethacin provocation and correlated with 2-hour LMR test results.

"The effectiveness of a hydrocolloid crusting method versus standard care in the treatment of incontinence-associated dermatitis among adult patients in an acute care setting: A randomised controlled trial.","Gunasegaran N||Ang SY||Ng YZ||Lee NES||Agus N||Lee CW||Ong CE||Mostafa SS||Aloweni F","Journal of tissue viability","10.1016/j.jtv.2023.01.007","32","2","2023","INTRODUCTION: Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) is a type of irritant contact dermatitis due to prolonged exposure of the skin to moisture induced by urine or/and faeces. The main principles when treating IAD involves protecting the skin from further exposure to irritants, establishing a healing environment, and eradicating skin infections. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the hydrocolloid crusting method (HCM) versus the standard care method (SCM) in treating IAD. METHOD: A randomised controlled trial was conducted in an acute tertiary hospital in Singapore between August 2019 to September 2021. Using computer-generated numbers, patients were randomised into either HCM or SCM treatment groups. HCM treatment involved cleansing the affected area with a pH-neutral non-rinse moisturising cleanser, and the application of alternate layers of hydrocolloid powder, and non-sting film barrier spray (repeated three times during each use). Patients in the SCM treatment group received the same cleanser followed by a 30% zinc oxide barrier cream. IAD was assessed daily for up to seven days by the wound care nurses using the IAD severity tool. The primary outcome of the study was the mean difference in IAD score per day between both methods. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were eligible and recruited (22 in HCM; 22 in SCM). Patients in both groups were comparable in age and gender. IAD Category 2 was more predominant in both methods. The most common location of IAD was at the perianal skin and diarrhea related to gastroenteritis was the most prevalent cause of IAD. More patients in the SCM group (n = 12; 54.5%) had their IAD healed within seven days compared to HCM, (n = 7; 31.8%) group. However, the average decrease in IAD scores per day for both methods were found to be similar. CONCLUSION: HCM can be considered as a treatment of IAD along with the use of SCM. A skin care regimen should include effective cleansing, skin protection, and moisturization in IAD management."
"Defining optimal treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (OpTION study): A randomized, double-blind comparison of three antibiotic regimens for patients with a first or second recurrence.","Johnson S||Gerding DN||Li X||Reda DJ||Donskey CJ||Gupta K||Goetz MB||Climo MW||Gordin FM||Ringer R||Johnson N||Johnson M||Calais LA||Goldberg AM||Ge L||Haegerich T","Contemporary clinical trials","10.1016/j.cct.2022.106756","116",NA,"2022","BACKGROUND: Although many large, randomized controlled trials (RCT) have been conducted on antibiotic therapy for patients with primary C. difficile infections (CDI), few RCTs have been performed for patients with recurrent CDI (rCDI). In addition, fecal microbial transplant (FMT) is neither FDA-approved or guideline-recommended for patients with pauci-rCDI (first or second recurrences). Therefore, a rigorous RCT of sufficient size was designed to determine the optimal treatment among three antibiotic regimens in current practice for treatment of pauci-rCDI. METHODS: VA Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) #596 is a prospective, double-blind, multi-center clinical trial of veteran patients with pauci-rCDI comparing fidaxomicin (FDX) 200 mg twice daily for 10 days and vancomycin (VAN) 125 mg four times daily for 10 days followed by a 3-week vancomycin taper and pulse (VAN-T/P) regimen to a standard course of VAN 125 mg four times daily for 10 days. The primary endpoint is sustained clinical response at day 59, with sustained response measured as a diarrhea composite outcome (D-COM) that includes symptom resolution during treatment (before day 10) without recurrence of diarrhea or other clinically important outcomes through day 59. DISCUSSION: CSP study 596 is designed to compare three current antibiotic treatments for recurrent CDI that are in clinical practice, but which lack high-quality evidence to support strong guideline recommendations. The design of the study which included a pilot phase initiated at six sites with expansion to 24 sites is described along with protocol modifications based on early trial experience and clinical realities including the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Impact of short-term overfeeding of saturated or unsaturated fat or sugars on the gut microbiota in relation to liver fat in obese and overweight adults.","Jian C||Luukkonen P||Sadevirta S||Yki-Jarvinen H||Salonen A","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)","10.1016/j.clnu.2020.05.008","40","1","2021","BACKGROUNDS & AIMS: Intestinal microbiota may be causally involved in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We aimed to study the effect of short-term overfeeding on human gut microbiota in relation to baseline and overfeeding-induced liver steatosis. We also asked whether the baseline microbiota composition is associated to the overfeeding-induced increase in liver fat. METHODS: In a randomized trial, 38 overweight and obese subjects were assigned to consume an excess of 1000 kcal/day of diets rich in either saturated fat, unsaturated fat, or simple sugars for 3 weeks. Fasting blood samples and (1)H-MR spectroscopy were used for extensive clinical phenotyping as previously reported (PMID: 29844096). Fecal samples were collected for the analysis of the gut microbiota using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, imputed metagenomics and qPCR. Microbiota results were correlated with dietary intakes and clinical measurements before and during overfeeding. RESULTS: The overall community structure of the microbiota remained highly stable and personalized during overfeeding based on between-sample Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, but the relative abundances of individual taxa were altered in a diet-specific manner: overfeeding saturated fat increased Proteobacteria, while unsaturated fat increased butyrate producers. Sugar overfeeding increased Lactococcus and Escherichia coli. Imputed functions of the gut microbiota were not affected by overfeeding. Several taxa affected by overfeeding significantly correlated with the changes in host metabolic markers. The baseline levels of proteobacterial family Desulfovibrionaceae, and especially genus Bilophila, were significantly associated to overfeeding-induced liver fat increase independently of the diet arm. In general, limited overlap was observed between the overfeeding-induced microbiota changes and the liver fat-associated microbiota features at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Our work indicates that the human gut microbiota is resilient to short-term overfeeding on community level, but specific taxa are altered on diet composition-dependent manner. Generalizable microbiota signatures directly associated with liver steatosis could not be identified. Instead, the carriage of Bilophila was identified as a potential novel risk factor for diet-induced liver steatosis in humans.

We implemented an integrated home-environmental intervention package (IHIP), comprising a kitchen sink, hygiene education and a certified improved biomass cookstove, and an early child development (ECD) programme to improve children s health and developmental outcomes in the rural high-altitude Andes of Peru. METHODS: We conducted a one-year cluster-randomised controlled trial among 317 children < 36 months divided into 4 arms (IHIP + ECD, IHIP, ECD, and Control) and 40 clusters (10 clusters per arm). ECD status (socio-emotional, fine and gross motor, communication, cognitive skills, and an overall performance) measured with the Peruvian Infant Development Scale and the occurrence of self-reported child diarrhoea from caretakers were primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of acute respiratory infections and the presence of thermo-tolerant faecal bacteria in drinking water. The trial was powered to compare each intervention against its control arm but it did not allow pairwise comparisons among the four arms. Primary analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle. For the statistical analysis, we employed generalised estimating equation models with robust standard errors and an independent correlation structure. RESULTS: We obtained ECD information from 101 children who received the ECD intervention (individually and combined with IHIP) and 102 controls. Children who received the ECD intervention performed better in all the domains compared to controls. We found differences in the overall performance (64 vs. 39%, odd ratio (OR): 2.8; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-4.9) and the cognitive domain (62 vs 46%, OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.1-3.5). Data analysis of child morbidity included 154 children who received the IHIP intervention (individually and combined with ECD) and 156 controls. We recorded 110,666 child-days of information on diarrhoea morbidity and observed 1.3 mean episodes per child-year in the children who received the IHIP intervention and 1.1 episodes in the controls. This corresponded to an incidence risk ratio of 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8-1.7). CONCLUSIONS: Child stimulation improved developmental status in children, but there was no health benefit associated with the home-environmental intervention. Limited year-round access to running water at home and the possible contamination of drinking water after boiling were two potential factors linked to the lack of effect of the home-environmental intervention. Potential interactions between ECD and home-environmental interventions need to be further investigated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN-26548981.

Biofermin-R (BFR) is a multiple antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria preparation of Enterococcus faecium 129 BIO 3B-R and is effective in normalizing the gut microbiota when used in combination with antibiotics. This study aimed to determine the effect of BFR in combination with vonoprazan (VPZ)-based therapy on gut microbiota. METHODS: Patients with positive urinary anti-H pylori antibody test (primary test) and fecal H pylori antigen test (secondary test) were examined. Patients in group 1 (BFR(-) ) received VPZ (20 mg twice daily), amoxicillin (750 mg twice daily), and clarithromycin (400 mg twice daily) for 7 days. Patients in group 2 (BFR(+) ) received BFR (3 tablets/day) for 7 days, in addition to the aforementioned treatments. Following treatment, the relative abundance, alpha-diversity, and beta-diversity of gut microbiota were assessed. RESULTS: Supplementation with BFR prevented the decrease in a-diversity after eradication therapy (Day 7). beta-diversity was similar between groups. The incidence rate of diarrhea was non-significantly higher in the BFR(-) than in the BFR(+) group (73.1% vs 56.5%; P = .361). Stool consistency was comparable in the BFR(+) group on Days 7 and 1 (3.86 +/- 0.95 vs 3.86 +/- 1.46; P = .415). CONCLUSION: Biofermin-R combined with VPZ-based therapy resulted in higher microbial alpha-strain diversity and suppressed stool softening during H pylori eradication therapy."

Our objective was to determine the effectiveness of CP therapy in improving the disease course of COVID-19 among high-risk outpatients. METHODS: A multicentre, double-blind randomized trial was conducted comparing 300 mL of CP with non-CP. Patients were >/=50 years, were symptomatic for <8 days, had confirmed RT-PCR or antigen test result for COVID-19 and had at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19. The primary endpoint was the highest score on a 5-point ordinal scale ranging from fully recovered (score = 1) or not (score = 2) on day 7, over hospital admission (score = 3), intensive care unit admission (score = 4) and death (score = 5) in the 28 days following randomization. Secondary endpoints were hospital admission, symptom duration and viral RNA excretion. RESULTS: After the enrolment of 421 patients and the transfusion in 416 patients, recruitment was discontinued when the countrywide vaccination uptake in those aged >50 years was 80%. Patients had a median age of 60 years, symptoms for 5 days, and 207 of 416 patients received CP therapy. During the 28 day follow-up, 28 patients were hospitalized and two died. The OR for an improved disease severity score with CP was 0.86 (95% credible interval, 0.59-1.22). The OR was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.33-1.02) for patients with </=5 days of symptoms. The hazard ratio for hospital admission was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.28-1.34). No difference was found in viral RNA excretion or in the duration of symptoms.

So, it seems that the modulation of intestinal microbial ecology by pro-/pre-/synbiotics may contribute to the progression and prevention of metabolic diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of probiotics and synbiotic supplementation on the modification of the intestinal microbiome in adults with prediabetes. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 120 patients with prediabetes were randomly assigned to consume 6 g/d of either a placebo containing maltodextrin (control) or multispecies probiotic or inulin-based synbiotic for 6 mo. Fecal samples were obtained at baseline and after 6 mo of supplementation. Dietary intake was assessed throughout the study (at baseline and after 3 and 6 mo). Total energy, macronutrients, and dietary fiber were calculated using a dietary program Nutritionist 4. DNA was extracted from fecal samples and the numbers of Clostridium perfringens (the represent of phylum Firmicutes), Bacteroides fragilis (the representative of Bacteroidetes) and Escherichia coli (as universal bacteria) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR). The changes in the relative abundance of the two fecal bacteria before and after supplementation were analyzed and compared within and between groups. RESULTS: There were no significant changes in dietary intake during the study. Six mo of supplementation with probiotics resulted in a statistically significant increase in the abundance of the B. fragilis-to-E.coli ratio (mean difference [MD] +/- SE 0.47 +/- 0.37, P = 0.04) and decrease of the relative proportion of Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes representatives (MD +/- SE -118.8 +/- 114.6, P = 0.02). Synbiotic had no significant effect on the changes in the bacteria. There were no significant differences between the three groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that manipulation of the human gut microbiome by using probiotics could provide a potential therapeutic approach in the prevention and management of obesity and metabolic disorders such as diabetes."

However, long-term crises received unparallel attention. Researchers have previously carried out a trial that investigated the impact of using chemical means to treat water reservoirs of Um-Baddah Nevachah, a refugee camp located in the western outskirts of Khartoum, Sudan. A double-blind community experimental trial was carried out by randomly adding either chlorine or a placebo to the major water tanks in the area. Data were collected using a mixed-methods study design. The primary input was the quantitative data derived from total coliforms lab tests and records of the local primary healthcare center, while the embedded (nested) portion generated most of the qualitative data from direct face-to-face interviews. As a case analysis, this study aims to critically appraise the original trial. In the Background the authors discussed the context of the trial, approach used, and outcomes. Discussion section included three issues related to the trial: scientific importance, challenges and strategies. DISCUSSION: Importance: There are two factors that contribute to the importance of this study: First, the integrated and systematic approach followed to resolve associated challenges. The study swiftly moved from investigating potential water contamination, to test whether it is related to an endogenous focus that auto-taints drinking water, and finally it explored the impact of tanks chlorination on public health. Second, the longstanding humanitarian context which remains largely underreported in literature. Challenges: funding limitations were among the first obstacles faced. During the fieldwork preparation phase, a lot of work was required to resolve logistical and security challenges. Keeping volunteers motivated was the biggest concern during the last phase of data collection. Strategies: The ""Matrix Solutions Strategy"" was developed and used to optimize scarce resources to simultaneously target multiple problems through a single intervention. CONCLUSION: Key lessons learned from the whole experience were: persistence is paramount for the success of studies in precarious situations; lateral thinking generates alternative solutions that are novel, feasibility and practical in resources-limited settings; and finally respecting local culture and regulations is essential for building trust with both authorities and vulnerable societies."

METHODS: Stool samples were collected pre-randomisation from care home residents participating in a randomised placebo-controlled trial. Cultivable clinically relevant bacteria were analysed. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by agar dilution (amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, gentamicin, trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, and ciprofloxacin). We also aimed to detect resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, and vancomycin. RESULTS: Stool samples were available for 159/310 residents participating in the trial (51%) from 23 care homes between 2016 and 2018. In total, 402 bacterial isolates were cultured from 158 stool samples and 29 different species were cultured. The five most common species were Escherichia coli (155/158, 98%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (40/158, 25%), Enterococcus faecalis (35/158, 22%), Enterococcus faecium (30/158, 19%), and Proteus mirabilis (25/158, 16%). Enterobacterales isolates were cultured from 157 samples (99%), and resistance to at least one of the tested antimicrobials was found in 119 of these (76%). There were high levels of variation in outcomes by care home. DISCUSSION: We demonstrated that care home residents harbour significant levels of antimicrobial-resistant organisms in their stool. This work emphasises the importance of both enhanced infection control practices and antimicrobial stewardship programmes to support the appropriate use of antimicrobials in this setting."

Evidence-based guidance is needed to improve interventions and remove barriers to diarrheal disease reduction. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate how sensitive WASH intervention effectiveness was to underlying contextual and intervention factors in the WASH Benefits (WASH-B) Bangladesh cluster-randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The investigators measured diarrheal prevalence in children enrolled in the WASH-B trial at three time points approximately 1 year apart (n = 17,187 observations). We developed a susceptible-infectious-susceptible model with transmission across multiple environmental pathways and evaluated each of four interventions [water (W), sanitation (S), hygiene (H), and nutrition (N) applied individually and in combination], compliance with interventions, and the impact of individuals not enrolled in the study. Leveraging a set of mechanistic parameter combinations fit to the WASH-B Bangladesh trial using a hybrid Bayesian sampling-importance resampling and maximum-likelihood estimation approach, we simulated trial outcomes under counterfactual scenarios to estimate how changes in six WASH factors (preexisting WASH conditions, disease transmission potential, intervention compliance, intervenable fraction of transmission, intervention efficacy, and community coverage) impacted intervention effectiveness. RESULTS: Increasing community coverage had the greatest impact on intervention effectiveness (e.g., median increases in effectiveness of 34.0 and 45.5 percentage points in the WSH and WSHN intervention arms when increasing coverage to 20%). The effect of community coverage on effectiveness depended on how much transmission was along pathways not modified by the interventions. Intervention effectiveness was reduced by lower levels of preexisting WASH conditions or increased baseline disease burden. Individual interventions had complementary but not synergistic effects when combined. DISCUSSION: To realize the expected health gains, future WASH interventions must address community coverage and transmission along pathways not traditionally covered by WASH. The effectiveness of individual-level WASH improvements is reduced more the further the community is from achieving the coverage needed for herd protection. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP15200."

The primary outcome, average daily incidence of upper respiratory tract symptoms, showed no significant difference between groups. However, the probiotic yogurt group experienced a significant reduction in respiratory tract infection symptoms over time (p = 0.02). Biomarker analysis revealed significant changes in the probiotic yogurt group, including higher urine hippurate levels (p = 0.02), increased lactic acid bacteria (p = 0.04) and total bacterial load (p = 0.04) in stool, and elevated SLPI (p = 0.005) in saliva from baseline to endline. Despite these within-group effects, the lack of significant differences between the yogurt and placebo groups highlights the need for further research with larger cohorts and longer durations to confirm the potential benefits of this probiotic yogurt for reducing infection symptoms and improving health biomarkers under these study conditions."

RESULTS: Twenty-six eligible patients were enrolled, and 6 patients were excluded. Ultimately, 20 patients were randomized to the FMT group (n = 10) and the control group (n = 10); 80% were females (F/M = 16/4), the mean age was 48 +/- 14 years, and the mean duration was 6.4 +/- 8.2 years. The mean length of post-FMT follow-up was 19.1 +/- 10.1 months (6-38). No statistically significant differences in baseline demographic or clinical characteristics were found between the groups. Ninety percent of patients in the FMT group and 50% of patients in the control group met the primary endpoint at week 8. The Mayo score was significantly decreased compared with that of the control group (n = 10) when reassessed at week 4 (P = 0.001) and week 8 (P = 0.019) after FMT; there was no significant difference 6 months after treatment. The median remission time was 24 months (95% CI 68.26-131.7%) in both the FMT (range 6-38 months) and control groups (range 7-35 months), with no significant difference (P = 0.895). Participants tolerated FMT treatment, and no adverse events occurred during long-term follow-up, with one treatment-related significant adverse event (EBV infection) occurring within 2 weeks after FMT. Stool microbiota composition analysis indicated improved gut microbiota diversity after FMT, with expansion of stool-donor taxa. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla of the gut microbiota in active UC patients. The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes decreased and that of Proteobacteria increased significantly in active UC patients compared with donors, while Firmicutes showed no significant changes. A single fresh FMT could effectively reconstruct the gut microbiota composition in patients with active UC and maintain stability, with increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Proteobacteria abundance. FMT significantly reduced the relative abundance of Escherichia and increased the relative abundance of Prevotella at the genus level. Pyruvate metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis showed significant differences after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Monotherapy with a single fresh FMT is an effective and safe strategy to induce long-term remission without drugs in patients with active UC and may be an alternative induction therapy for recurrent UC or even primary UC."

We modelled benefits and costs of the intervention over 10 years, as compared to an existing local government program. Health benefits were estimated as the value of averted mortality due to diarrheal disease and the cost of illness arising from averted diarrheal morbidity. We also estimated the value of time savings from avoided open defecation and use of neighbours' latrines. Intervention delivery costs were estimated top-down based on financial records, while recurrent costs were estimated bottom-up from trial data. We explored methodological and parameter uncertainty using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Avoided mortality accounted for 58% of total benefits, followed by time savings from increased access to household latrines. The base case benefit-cost ratio was 3.7 (95% CI: 1.9-5.4) and the net present value was Int'l $1,193,786 (95% CI: 406,017-1,977,960). The sources of the largest uncertainty in one-way sensitivity analyses were the effect of the CLTS intervention and the assumed lifespan of an improved latrine. Our results suggest that CLTS interventions can yield favourable economic returns, particularly if follow-up after the triggering is implemented intensively and uptake of improved latrines is achieved (as opposed to unimproved)."

INTERVENTIONS: A loan to purchase a human-powered irrigation pump, fertilizer, seeds, and pesticides combined with the provision of training in sustainable agriculture and financial literacy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the relative change from baseline to the end of follow-up in viral load suppression (</=200 copies/mL) compared between study groups using difference-in-differences analyses. Secondary outcomes included clinic attendance, ART adherence, food insecurity, depression, self-confidence, and social support. RESULTS: A total of 720 participants were enrolled (396 women [55.0%]; mean [SD] age, 40.38 [9.12] years), including 366 in the intervention group and 354 in the control group. Retention included 677 (94.0%) at the 24-month visit. HIV viral suppression improved in both groups from baseline to end of follow-up from 314 of 366 (85.8%) to 327 of 344 (95.1%) in the intervention group and from 291 of 353 (82.4%) to 314 of 333 (94.3%) in the control group (P = .86). Food insecurity decreased more in the intervention than the control group (difference in linear trend, -3.54 [95% CI, -4.16 to -2.92]). Proportions of those with depression during the 24-month follow-up period declined more in the intervention group (from 169 of 365 [46.3%] to 36 of 344 [10.5%]) than the control group (106 of 354 [29.9%] to 41 of 333 [12.3%]; difference in trend, -0.83 [95% CI, -1.45 to -0.20]). Self-confidence improved more in the intervention than control group (difference in trend, -0.37 [95% CI, -0.59 to -0.15]; P = .001), as did social support (difference in trend, -3.63 [95% CI, -4.30 to -2.95]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cluster randomized trial, the multisectoral agricultural intervention led to demonstrable health and other benefits; however, it was not possible to detect additional effects of the intervention on HIV clinical indicators. Agricultural interventions that improve productivity and livelihoods hold promise as a way of addressing food insecurity and the underpinnings of poor health among people living with HIV in resource-limited settings.

"Characterizing the Effects of Calcium and Prebiotic Fiber on Human Gut Microbiota Composition and Function Using a Randomized Crossover Design-A Feasibility Study.","Yoon LS||Michels KB","Nutrients","10.3390/nu13061937","13","6","2021","Consumption of prebiotic inulin has been found to increase calcium absorption, which may protect against gut diseases such as colorectal cancer. This dietary relation may be modulated by compositional changes in the gut microbiota; however, no human study has addressed this hypothesis. We determined the feasibility of a randomized crossover trial to evaluate the effect of three interventions (combined calcium and inulin supplementation, calcium supplementation alone, and inulin supplementation alone) on the intestinal microbiota composition and function. We conducted a 16-week pilot study in 12 healthy adults who consumed the three interventions in a random sequence. Participants provided fecal and blood samples before and after each intervention. Each intervention period lasted four weeks and was flanked by one-week washout periods. 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and quantification of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) was determined in fecal samples. Systemic lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) was quantified in serum. Of the 12 individuals assigned to an intervention sequence, seven completed the study. Reasons for dropout included time (n = 3), gastrointestinal discomfort (n = 1), and moving (n = 1). Overall, participants reported positive attitudes towards the protocol (n = 9) but were unsatisfied by the practicalities of supplement consumption (44%) and experienced digestive discomfort (56%). We found no appreciable differences in microbial composition, SCFA concentration, nor LBP concentrations when comparing intervention periods. In conclusion, an intervention study using a randomized crossover design with calcium and a prebiotic fiber is feasible. Improvements of our study design include using a lower dose prebiotic fiber supplement and a larger sample size."

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the impact of Fruitflow, a water-soluble tomato extract, on TMAO, fecal microbiota, and plasma and fecal metabolites. METHODS: Overweight and obese adults (n = 22, BMI 28-35 kg/m(2)) were included in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study receiving 2x150 mg Fruitflow per day or placebo (maltodextrin) for 4 wk with a 6-week wash-out between interventions. Stool, blood, and urine samples were collected to assess changes in plasma TMAO (primary outcome) as well as fecal microbiota, fecal and plasma metabolites, and urine TMAO (secondary outcomes). In a subgroup (n = 9), postprandial TMAO was evaluated following a choline-rich breakfast ( approximately 450 mg). Statistical methods included paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests and permutational multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: Fruitflow, but not placebo, reduced fasting levels of plasma (-1.5 muM, P </= 0.05) and urine (-19.1 muM, P </= 0.01) TMAO as well as plasma lipopolysaccharides (-5.3 ng/mL, P </= 0.05) from baseline to the end of intervention. However, these changes were significant only for urine TMAO levels when comparing between the groups (P </= 0.05). Changes in microbial beta, but not alpha, diversity paralleled this with a significant difference in Jaccard distance-based Principal Component (P </= 0.05) as well as decreases in Bacteroides, Ruminococccus, and Hungatella and increases in Alistipes when comparing between and within groups (P </= 0.05, respectively). There were no between-group differences in SCFAs and bile acids (BAs) in both faces and plasma but several changes within groups such as an increase in fecal cholic acid or plasma pyruvate with Fruitflow (P </= 0.05, respectively). An untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed TMAO as the most discriminant plasma metabolite between groups (P </= 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support earlier findings that polyphenol-rich extracts can lower plasma TMAO in overweight and obese adults related to gut microbiota modulation. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04160481 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04160481?term= Fruitflow&draw= 2&rank= 2)."

This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase I study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of EVER206 in healthy Chinese subjects. After single administration of 50-300 mg EVER206, the C(max) ranged from 3.94 to 25.82 mg/L, and the AUC(0-inf) ranged from 12.42 to 101.67 h.mg/L. The plasma exposure displayed a linear relationship with the dose administered. After administration of 75 and 100 mg of EVER206 every 8 hours (q8 hour), a steady state was achieved on Day 2. The accumulation ratios of C(max) and AUC from Day 1 to Day 7 were in the range of 1.12 to 1.3. The elimination half-lives ranged from 2.86 to 4.32 hours in the single-ascending-dose (SAD) study and 4.71 to 6.18 hours in the multiple-ascending-dose (MAD) study. The urinary excretion of unchanged EVER206 increased with the dose, with the mean cumulative fraction ranging from 23.70% to 47.10%. EVER206 was safe and well-tolerated in Chinese healthy subjects. No severe treatment emerging adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events, or TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported. The results of the present study demonstrated a similar safety profile of EVER206 with data reported in an earlier study on SPR206-101. The exposure of EVER206 in Chinese healthy subjects was higher than that in Australian healthy subjects. These results could enable further clinical development of EVER206 in Chinese patients with severe MDR Gram-negative pathogen infections.CLINICAL TRIALSThis study was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry under identifier ChiCTR2200056692."

The effectiveness of bowel modifiers for improving FI is unclear. METHODS: In this double-blind, parallel-group, randomized trial, women with urge FI were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a combination of oral clonidine (0.1 mg twice daily) with colesevelam (1875 mg twice daily) or two inert tablets for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was a >/=50% decrease in number of weekly FI episodes. KEY RESULTS: Fifty-six participants were randomly assigned to clonidine-colesevelam (n = 24) or placebo (n = 32); 51 (91%) completed 4 weeks of treatment. At baseline, participants had a mean (SD) of 7.5 (8.2) FI episodes weekly. The primary outcome was met for 13 of 24 participants (54%) treated with clonidine-colesevelam versus 17 of 32 (53%) treated with placebo (p = 0.85). The Bristol stool form score decreased significantly, reflecting more formed stools with clonidine-colesevelam treatment (mean [SD], 4.5 [1.5] to 3.2 [1.5]; p = 0.02) but not with placebo (4.2 [1.9] to 4.1 [1.9]; p = 0.47). The proportion of FI episodes for semiformed stools decreased significantly from a mean (SD) of 76% (8%) to 61% (10%) in the clonidine-colesevelam group (p = 0.007) but not the placebo group (61% [8%] to 67% [8%]; p = 0.76). However, these treatment effects did not differ significantly between groups. Overall, clonidine-colesevelam was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Compared with placebo, clonidine-colesevelam did not significantly improve FI despite being associated with more formed stools and fewer FI episodes for semiformed stools."

This study was conducted to investigate whether this survival benefit is associated with microbiome dysbiosis. Patients with sepsis due to lung infection, acute pyelonephritis or primary bacteraemia were randomised to standard-of-care (SoC) duration of antibiotics or early stop using PCT. Faecal samples were collected before, and 7 and 28 days after randomisation and analysed using 16S rRNA Nanopore sequencing. Calprotectin was measured using an enzyme immunoassay. Median (Q(1)-Q(3)) antimicrobial duration was 5 (5-7.5) days in the PCT arm and 11 (8-15) days in the SoC arm (P < 0.001). Faecal calprotectin levels were similar in the two treatment arms at baseline. By day 7, the levels of faecal calprotectin were significantly increased in the SoC arm (P = 0.002) but were unchanged in the PCT arm. Microbiome alpha- and beta-diversity was similar at baseline in the PCT (n=81) and SoC (n=76) treatment arms. Shannon's index was significantly lower in the SoC arm on day 7 compared with baseline (median [Q(1)-Q(3)], 2.88 [2.37-3.39] at day 1 vs. 2.24 [1.52-3.08] at day 7; P(t-test) = 0.0013).

The objectives of the study were to compare sociodemographic characteristics, history of gastrointestinal (GI) investigations and Helicobacter pylori eradication, and modifiable cancer risk factors between those with FHC and those with no FHC (NFHC), and to investigate the association between FHC and a history of GI investigations. METHODS: A total of 3,455 questionnaires from the pilot study of the ""Helicobacter pylori eradication and pepsinogen testing for prevention of gastric cancer mortality (GISTAR study)"" in Latvia were analysed. We compared sociodemographic characteristics and history of GI investigations between participants with self- reported FHC and NFHC. Binary logistic regression models adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics and modifiable cancer risk factors were built for a FHC and each GI investigation. RESULTS: Participants with a FHC were more likely to be women, have a higher education and less likely to have harmful habits (smoking, alcohol consumption) than those with NFHC. Participants with a FHC were approximately twice as likely to report recent colorectal investigations specifically for screening, than those with NFHC. In fully adjusted logistic regression models, FHC was significantly associated with a recent history of faecal occult blood tests (FOBTs), colonoscopies, and colorectal investigations (FOBT or colonoscopy) specifically for screening as part of the national organized screening programme. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that those with a FHC have different patterns of health-related behaviour than those with NFHC."

Herein, our aim was to explore the short-term effect of VA therapy on the gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) using human fecal samples. A total of 119 H. pylori-positive patients were randomized into low- or high-dose VA therapy (i.e., amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. or t.i.d. and VPZ 20 mg b.i.d.) for 7 or 10 days. Thirteen H. pylori-negative patients served as controls. Fecal samples were collected from H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative patients. The gut microbiota and SCFAs were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. The gut microbiota in H. pylori-positive patients exhibited increased richness, diversity, and better evenness than matched patients. Fifty-three patients studied before and after H. pylori eradication were divided into low (L-VA) and high (H-VA) amoxicillin dose groups. The diversity and composition of the gut microbiota among L-VA patients exhibited no differences at the three time points. However, among H-VA patients, diversity was decreased, and the microbial composition was altered immediately after H-VA eradication but was restored by the confirmation time point. The decreased abundance of Anaerostipes, Dialister, and Lachnospira induced by H-VA was associated with altered SCFA levels. VA dual therapy for H. pylori eradication has minimal negative effects on gut microbiota and SCFAs."

METHODS: In this prospective, single center study, patients with UC were randomly assigned to the Mesalazine group (n=20) or the UDCA + Mesalazine group (n=20). Mayo score and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), and fecal samples for 16S rRNA sequencing and blood samples for IL-23 and IL-17 ELISA were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Mayo scores and IBDQ score of the UDCA + Mesalazine group were significantly better than those of the Mesalazine group (P = 0.015 and P < 0.001, respectively). At post-treatment week 4, IL-23 and IL-17 levels were significantly lower in the UDCA + Mesalazine group compared to those in the Mesalazine group (both P < 0.038). In patients with UC after treatment, Firmicutes in the UDCA + Mesalazine group was higher than those in the Mesalazine group (P < 0.001). The UDCA + Mesalazine group showed lower percentage of Proteobacteria compared to those in the Mesalazine group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Additional UDCA could provide better therapeutic effects than mesalazine alone, possibly due to the change of IL-23 and IL-17 and the proportional distribution of intestinal microflora."

In a randomised, crossover, comparison study, undertaken in twelve healthy males, an alginate-containing feed (F + ALG) or one that was alginate-free (F-ALG) (300 ml) was given over 1 h with a 7-14-d washout period between treatments. Baseline and for 4-h post-feed initiation, MRI measurements were made to establish small bowel water content (SBWC), gastric contents volume (GCV) and appearance, and superior mesenteric artery blood flux. Blood glucose and gut peptides were measured. Subjective appetite and upper gastrointestinal symptoms scores were obtained. Ad libitum pasta consumption 3-h post-feeding was measured. F + ALG exhibited a gastric appearance consistent with gelling surrounded by a freely mobile water halo. Significant main effects of feed were seen for SBWC (P = 0.03) and peptide YY (PYY) (P = 0.004) which were attributed to generally higher values for SBWC with F + ALG (max difference between adjusted means 72 ml at 210 min) and generally lower values for PYY with F + ALG. GCV showed a faster reduction with F + ALG, less between-participant variation and a feed-by-time interaction (P = 0.04). Feed-by-time interactions were also seen with glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) (P = 0.02) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) (P = 0.002), both showing a blunted response with F + ALG. Apparent intragastric gelling with F + ALG and subsequent differences in gastrointestinal and endocrine responses have been demonstrated between an alginate-containing and alginate-free feed."

Journal of parenteral and enteral nutrition","10.1002/jpen.2224","46","4","2022","BACKGROUND: The gut-liver axis and enterohepatic circulation have gained increasing attention lately. Patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) are, in fact, human knock-out models that may assist in the understanding of bile acid synthesis and regulation. We evaluated effect of glepaglutide (a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-2 analog) on bile acid synthesis (the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and liver biochemistry in patients with SBS). METHOD: In a single-center, double-blinded, dose-finding, crossover phase 2 trial, 18 patients with SBS were randomly assigned to 2 of 3 treatment arms (0.1, 1, and 10 mg) with daily subcutaneous injections of glepaglutide for 3 weeks. The washout period between the 2 treatment periods was 4-8 weeks. Measurements were performed at baseline and at the end of each treatment period and included postprandial plasma samples for fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), total excretion of fecal bile acids, gene expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in intestinal mucosal biopsies, total plasma bile acids, and liver biochemistry. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, the median (interquartile range) postprandial response (area under the curve 0-2h) of FGF19 increased by 150 h x ng/L (41, 195; P = 0.001) and C4 decreased by 82 h x microg/L (-169, -28; p = 0.010) in the 10-mg dose. FXR gene expression did not change in any of the groups. Alkaline phosphatase significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: Glepaglutide may stimulate the bile acid/FXR/FGF19 axis, leading to increased plasma concentrations of FGF19. Thereby, glepaglutide may ameliorate the accelerated de novo bile acid synthesis and play a role in the prevention and/or treatment of intestinal failure-associated liver disease."

These exposures, however, can select for antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the gut microbiota. METHODS: Our previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a rapid-test-and-treat strategy for severe acute diarrheal disease in children in Botswana included an intervention (3-day azithromycin dose) group and a control group that received supportive treatment. In this prospective matched cohort study using stools collected at baseline and 60 days after treatment from RCT participants, the collection of antibiotic resistance genes or resistome was compared between groups. RESULTS: Certain macrolide resistance genes increased in prevalence by 13%-55% at 60 days, without differences in gene presence between the intervention and control groups. These genes were linked to tetracycline resistance genes and mobile genetic elements. CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin treatment for bacterial diarrhea for young children in Botswana resulted in similar effects on the gut resistome as the supportive treatment and did not provide additional selective pressure for macrolide resistance gene maintenance. The gut microbiota of these children contains diverse macrolide resistance genes that may be transferred within the gut upon repeated exposures to azithromycin or coselected by other antibiotics.

Trimethylamine (TMA) is produced by gut bacteria from dietary choline, betaine, or L-carnitine, and is then converted in the liver to Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which in turn affects hepatic and intestinal lipid metabolism. Circulating TMAO is positively associated with CVD risk. Because eggs are rich in choline, it has been speculated that their consumption may increase plasma TMAO. In this study, we hypothesized that 2 eggs per day increases plasma TMAO level by altering gut microbiome composition in mildly hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women. In this randomized, cross-over study, 20 overweight, postmenopausal women were given 2 whole eggs and the equivalent amount of yolk-free substitute as breakfast for 4 weeks, in randomized order, with a 4-week washout in between. Fasting blood draws and stool were collected at the beginning and end of each treatment period. Plasma TMAO, choline, betaine and other metabolites were analyzed using LC/MS, while gut microbiome composition was analyzed using 16S amplicon sequencing. Plasma choline and betaine were significantly increased after whole egg but not yolk-free substitute, however TMAO level was not significantly affected by treatments. Gut microbiome composition showed large inter-individual variability at baseline and in response to the treatments. The consumption of 2 eggs per day in overweight, postmenopausal mildly hypercholesterolemic women significantly increased plasma choline and betaine, but did not increase plasma TMAO or alter gut microbiome composition."

A randomised, double-blind, controlled trial was performed on 136 adults under 14-day Hp treatment, receiving the Test or Control product for 28 days. AAD and GI-symptoms were reported and feces analysed for relative and quantitative gut microbiome composition, short chain fatty acids (SCFA), and calprotectin concentrations, and viability of ingested strains. No effect of Test product was observed on AAD or GI-symptoms. Hp treatment induced a significant alteration in bacterial and fungal composition, a decrease of bacterial count and alpha-diversity, an increase of Candida and calprotectin, and a decrease of SCFA concentrations. Following Hp treatment, in the Test as compared to Control group, intra-subject beta-diversity distance from baseline was lower (p(adj) = 0.02), some Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia-Shigella (p(adj) = 0.0082) and Klebsiella (p(adj) = 0.013), were less abundant, and concentrations of major SCFA (p = 0.035) and valerate (p = 0.045) were higher. Viable Lacticaseibacillus strains were detected during product consumption in feces. Results suggest that, in patients under Hp treatment, the consumption of a multi-strain fermented milk can induce a modest but significant faster recovery of the microbiota composition (beta-diversity) and of SCFA production and limit the increase of potentially pathogenic bacteria."

More children in the IG showed improvements in diarrhea compared to the CG, both in intention-to-treat analysis (81.7% vs. 40.0%, p < 0.001) and per protocol analysis (84.4% vs 45.3%, p < 0.001). Cathelicidin level in the IG was significantly higher than that in the CG after the intervention (4415.00 +/- 1036.93 pg/g vs. 3679.49 +/- 871.18 pg/g, p = 0.0175). The intervention led to an increased abundance of Bifidobacterium breve and Collinsella aerofaciens species, higher alpha-diversity (p < 0.05), and enrichment of functional genes in the gut microbiota related to immunity regulation. Administration of BLa80 at a dose of 5 x 10(9) CFU/day resulted in a shorter duration of diarrhea and alterations in gut microbiome composition and gene functions."
"Evaluating the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine in diminishing the duration and frequency of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis: a preliminary randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial.","Heydari B||Aflatonian M||Bagherizadeh M||Hoseinzade F||Saghafi F","BMC pediatrics","10.1186/s12887-025-05534-7","25","1","2025","BACKGROUND: Globally, gastroenteritis stands as a primary contributor to child mortality, annually taking the lives of 3 million children under the age of 5 years. Rotavirus, a major factor in viral diarrhea among children aged 6 months to 2 years, presents with severe symptoms such as watery diarrhea and vomiting. Although mortality rates have decreased due to supportive care and vaccines, promising alternatives like N-acetylcysteine (NAC) show potential benefits in laboratory studies, indicating a possible supplementary strategy for managing rotavirus infections by reducing the duration and antigen excretion in feces. METHODS: During this double-blind clinical trial, 71 patients, confirmed to have gastroenteritis resulting from rotavirus using a rapid diagnostic strip, were randomly allocated to two groups. One group was prescribed NAC at a dosage of 60 mg/kg/day, while the other received a placebo. The patient's progress was monitored daily until their gastroenteritis improved, and details regarding the duration of diarrhea and the frequency of bowel movements were recorded for each participant. RESULTS: The average duration of diarrhea in the NAC group and the placebo group was 2 and 3 days, respectively, with a level of p = 0.121. During the diarrhea period, the number of bowel movements in the NAC group was recorded at 28.1 +/- 21.6 times, whereas in the placebo group, it was 35.3 +/- 33.1 times, yielding a p-value of 0.409. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the effects of NAC were observed in lowering the duration of the period and decreasing the frequency of bowel movements in gastroenteritis, these results did not reach statistical significance. Hence, the data from this study suggest that NAC may not effectively reduce the duration of diarrhea and the frequency of bowel movements linked to gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus.

In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 16 subjects with IBD in remission consumed POMJ or placebo for 12 weeks. POMJ consumption significantly reduced fecal calprotectin (FC) and plasma endotoxin levels. Transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed upregulation of genes involved in mucosal immunity, including aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), neutrophil cytosolic factor 4 (NCF4), and nuclear factor, interleukin 3 regulated (NFIL3). Urolithin metabotypes were predominantly of the B type, associated with intestinal dysbiosis. No significant changes were observed in serum inflammatory markers or colonic mucosal cytokine expression. POMJ consumption reduced markers of intestinal inflammation and modulated gene expression related to mucosal immunity and barrier function in patients with IBD. These findings suggest the potential of POMJ as a beneficial dietary intervention for maintaining remission in IBD, highlighting the promise of targeted nutritional strategies in managing chronic inflammatory conditions. Further research is needed to elucidate the long-term clinical implications of these molecular changes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03000101."

In the present study, we first administered RS (0.25 mg/g food volume) orally to high-fat diet-treated mice for 4 weeks. RS increased the faecal volume and calorie excretion with decreased plasma lipids, which was in accordance with the results of our previous zebrafish study. Notably, as the excretion amount by RS increased in the mice, we hypothesised that RS could decrease the chance of constipation in mice and also in human subjects because RS is considered as a dietary fibre. We administrated RS (100 mg/day) to subjects with low defaecation frequencies (3-5 times/week) for 2 weeks in double-blind placebo-controlled manner. As a result, RS administration significantly increased the frequency of dejection without any side effects, although no effect was observed on the body weight and blood lipids. Moreover, we performed 16s rRNA-seq analysis of the gut microbiota in these subjects. Metagenomics profiling using PICRUSt revealed functional alternation of the KEGG pathways, which could be involved in the therapeutic effect of RS for constipation."

This randomized study was designed as a safety and feasibility study of long-term FMT in subjects with mild to moderate UC using frozen, encapsulated oral FMT (cFMT). METHODS: Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive FMT induction by colonoscopy, followed by 12 weeks of daily oral administration of frozen encapsulated cFMT or sham therpay. Subjects were followed for 36 weeks and longitudenal clinical assessments included multiple subjective and objective markers of disease severity. Ribosomal 16S bacterial sequencing was used to assess donor-induced changes in the gut microbiota. Changes in T regulatory (Treg) and mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cell populations were evaluated by flow cytometry as an exploratory endpoint. RESULTS: Twelve subjects with active UC were randomized: 6 subjects completed the full 12-week course of FMT plus cFMT, and 6 subjects received sham treatment by colonic installation and longitudinal oral placebo capules. Chronic administration of cFMT was found to be safe and well-tolerated but home storage concerns exist. Protocol adherence was high, and none of the study subjects experienced FMT-associated treatment emergent adverse events. Two subjects that received cFMT achieved clinical remission versus none in the placebo group (95% CI = 0.38-infinity, p = 0.45). cFMT was associated with sustained donor-induced shifts in fecal microbial composition. Changes in MAIT cell cytokine production were observed in cFMT recipients and correlated with treatment response. CONCLUSION: These pilot data suggest that daily encapsulated cFMT may extend the durability of index FMT-induced changes in gut bacterial community structure and that an association between MAIT cell cytokine production and clinical response to FMT may exist in UC populations. Oral frozen encapsulated cFMT is a promising FMT delivery system and may be preferred for longterm treatment strategies in UC and other chronic diseases but further evaluations will have to address home storage concerns. Larger trials should be done to explore the benefits of cFMT and to determine its long-term impacts on the colonic microbiome. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02390726).

PT20 (ferric iron oxide adipate) is an investigational molecule engineered to offer enhanced phosphate-binding properties relative to other phosphate binders. METHODS: In this double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02151643), the efficacy and safety of 28 days of oral PT20 treatment were evaluated in patients with dialysis-dependent CKD. Participants were randomly assigned in an 8:8:8:13:13 ratio to receive PT20 (400, 800, 1600 or 3200 mg) or placebo three times daily. RESULTS: Among 153 participants, 129 completed treatment [7 discontinued because of adverse events (AEs), 2 because of hyperphosphataemia and 15 for other reasons]. PT20 treatment for 28 days resulted in a statistically significant and dose-dependent reduction in serum phosphate concentration. There were no statistically significant effects of PT20 treatment on changes in haemoglobin or ferritin concentrations or transferrin saturation between Days 1 and 29. The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was broadly similar across the PT20 and placebo groups (42-59% versus 44%). The most common PT20 treatment-related AEs were gastrointestinal, primarily diarrhoea (13-18%) and discoloured faeces (3-23%). No serious AEs were considered to be related to study treatment. There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory results reflecting acid/base status or increases in ferritin that could indicate the absorption of components of PT20. CONCLUSIONS: In this first study investigating the efficacy and safety of PT20 in patients with hyperphosphataemia and dialysis-dependent CKD, PT20 significantly lowered serum phosphate concentrations and was generally well tolerated."

The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in health and affects the treatment effect of various interventions. However, the role of gut microbiota in VE remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the longitudinal impact of VE treatment on body health and the gut microbiota. METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 90 healthy individuals. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups: a treatment group receiving VE, another antioxidant treatment group receiving GSE, and a control group receiving a placebo. We found that VE ameliorated blood cholesterol levels by reducing the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in healthy volunteers. After the intervention, there was an increase in the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and bile acid metabolizers. Specifically, the abundances of Lachnospira sp. and Faecalibacterium spp. increased in the VE. Interestingly, the gut microbiota of poor responders harbored a greater proportion of disease-associated bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: VE could promote health by lowering LDL-C, partly and indirectly by affecting gut bacteria with the ability to produce SCFAs or metabolize bile acids.

The aim of this work was designed to assess the role of probiotics (Lactobacillus casei Zhang, Bifidobactetium animalis subsp. lactis V9, and Lactobacillus plantarum P-8) in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. METHODS: Thirty three patients with hyperlipidemia were randomly divided into a probiotic group (n = 18) and a control group (n = 15). The probiotic group was administered probiotics (2 g once daily) and atorvastatin 20 mg (once daily), and the control group was administered a placebo (2 g once daily) and atorvastatin 20 mg (once daily). Serum and fecal samples were gathered for subsequent analyses. RESULTS: Time had a significant effect on the total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in the probiotic and control groups (P < .05). The gut microbial abundance in the probiotic group was markedly higher than that in the control group following 3-month probiotic treatment (P < .05). At the phylum level, probiotics exerted no notable effects on the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria but elevated that of Tenericutes and reduced Proteobacteria. At the genus level, probiotics increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Akkermansia, and decreased that of Escherichia, Eggerthella, and Sutterella relative to the control group in months 1, 2, and 3 (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics optimize the gut microbiota structure and decrease the amount of harmful bacteria in patients with hyperlipidemia. Probiotics can influence the composition of gut microorganisms and increase their diversity and abundance in vivo. It is recommended to use probiotics combined with atorvastatin to treat patients with hyperlipidemia."

Azithromycin (AZ) has been shown to improve child survival and infant growth outcomes. This study aimed to assess the impact of AZ on Bifidobacterium infantis colonization and bacterial enteropathogen count in the infant gut. METHODS: We analyzed clinical, biomarker, B. infantis and enteropathogen data from 150 mother-infant dyads from the MUMTA Lactating Women study. Colonization of B. infantis was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of fecal samples. We utilized a customized PCR-based TaqMan Array Card for enteropathogen detection. RESULTS: AZ administration was associated with a 1.99-fold (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.33-2.97) increase in colonization by B. infantis. B. infantis colonization was highest when inflammatory biomarker levels were within normal range. Mode of delivery (RR 2.43; 95% CI: 1.58, 3.76) and colostrum (RR2.05; 95% CI: 1.41, 2.98) given to the infant within 24 h of birth were associated with B. infantis colonization. A single dose of AZ on day 42 reduced bacterial enteropathogen count in the AZ group on day 56, as compared to the pre-AZ count.

Due to its invasive nature, susceptibility testing based on endoscopic biopsy is controversial, while few studies have focused on the efficacy of tailored bismuth quadruple therapies (BQT) based on fecal susceptibility testing as a first-line treatment. METHODS: In this multicenter study, 598 H. pylori-positive patients without previous eradication treatment were recruited and randomly assigned to three groups: empirical BQT, BQT-tailored based on the history of clarithromycin use and tailored based on fecal molecular susceptibility testing where furazolidone was substituted for clarithromycin when there was clinical or laboratory evidence of clarithromycin resistance. This study defines BQT as regimens comprising rabeprazole, colloidal bismuth, amoxicillin, and one additional antibiotic (furazolidone or clarithromycin). The study assessed eradication rates using intention-to-treat (ITT), modified intention-to-treat (mITT), and per-protocol (PP) analyses. RESULTS: The eradication rates of three groups were 82.00%, 80.90%, and 87.44% in the ITT analysis; 82.41%, 83.42%, and 89.23% in the mITT analysis; and 85.86%, 87.50%, and 94.57% in the PP analysis, respectively. Tailored BQT based on fecal susceptibility testing was not inferior to empirical BQT (all p values for noninferiority < 0.001) and demonstrated greater efficacy in the PP analysis (difference [95% CI]: 7.07% [0.90%, 13.25%]). The incidence of adverse events and treatment compliance did not differ significantly among the groups. CONCLUSION: Tailored BQT based on fecal susceptibility testing is an effective regimen for H. pylori eradication, with no increase in adverse events or treatment noncompliance compared with empirical BQT. Therefore, we recommend tailored BQT based on fecal susceptibility testing as a first-line treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT number: NCT05718609; ClinicalTrials.gov."

We conducted a randomized prospective study with 2 objectives: (i) to investigate epithelial barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation induced by cardiopulmonary bypass and changes in the gut microbiota and (ii) to verify whether probiotics can improve these conditions. METHODS: Between 2019 and 2020, patients 0-15 years old scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled and randomly allocated to 2 groups: the intervention group received probiotics and the control group did not receive probiotics. We analysed the microbiota in faeces and blood, organic acid concentrations in faeces, plasma intestinal fatty acid-binding protein and immunological responses. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were enrolled in this study. The characteristics of the patients were similar in both groups. The total number of obligate anaerobes was higher in the intervention group than in the control group after postoperative day 7. We identified 4 clusters within the perioperative gut microbiota, and cluster changes showed a corrective effect of probiotics on dysbiosis after postoperative day 7. Organic acid concentrations in faeces, incidence of bacterial translocation, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein levels and immunological responses, except for interleukin -17A, were not markedly different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of probiotics was able to correct dysbiosis but did not sufficiently alleviate the intestinal damage induced by cardiopulmonary bypass.

The uricolysis of gut microbiota plays an important role in extrarenal excretion of UA. This study aimed to examine the effect of inulin-type prebiotics (a type of fermentable dietary fiber) on intestinal microbiota modulation and serum UA levels in ESRD patients. METHODS: Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients were recruited to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of 12-week inulin-type prebiotics. Participants were visited before and after treatment with prebiotics or placebo. Serum UA levels, dietary purine intake, serum xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, daily ""renal excretion"" of UA, and fecal UA degradation capability were measured at each visit. Fecal metagenomic analysis was conducted to assess microbial composition and function. RESULTS: Sixteen participants (mean age = 37 y; 10 men and 6 women) completed the trial, and 64 specimens were analyzed. The average concentration of serum UA decreased by approximately 10% in the prebiotic intervention group in comparison to the placebo group (p = 0.047) without an increase in daily ""renal excretion"" of UA via urine and dialysate. There were no significant changes in purine intake or activity of XO. Notably, enhanced fecal UA degradation was observed after prebiotic intervention (p = 0.041), and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, which was positively associated with fecal UA degradation, increased in the prebiotic period (p = 0.032). Furthermore, prebiotics enriched purine-degrading species in the gut microbiota, including unclassified_o_Clostridiales, Clostridium sp. CAG:7, Clostridium sp. FS41, Clostridium citroniae, Anaerostipes caccae, and Clostridium botulinum. CONCLUSIONS: Inulin-type prebiotics is a promising therapeutic candidate to reduce serum UA levels in renal failure patients, and this urate-lowering effect could possibly be attributed to intestinal microbial degradation of UA.

One proposed mechanism for these health benefits is via the microbiota, because WGW contains multiple fibers. WGW consumption has been proposed to ameliorate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, in which microbiota might play a role. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effect of WGW compared with RW intervention on the fecal microbiota composition and functionality, and correlated intervention-induced changes in bacteria with changes in liver health parameters in adults with overweight or obesity. METHODS: We used data of a 12-wk double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel trial to examine the effects of a WGW (98 g/d) or RW (98 g/d) intervention on the secondary outcomes fecal microbiota composition, predicted microbiota functionality, and stool consistency in 37 women and men (aged 45-70 y, BMI 25-35 kg/m2). The changes in microbiota composition, measured using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, after a 12-wk intervention were analyzed with nonparametric tests, and correlated with changes in liver fat and circulating concentrations of liver enzymes including alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and serum amyloid A. RESULTS: The WGW intervention increased the mean (+/- SD) relative abundances of Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 (baseline: 2.2 +/- 4.6%, differential change over time (Delta) 0.51 +/- 4.2%), Ruminiclostridium_9 (baseline: 0.065 +/- 0.11%, Delta 0.054 +/- 0.14%), and Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group (baseline: 0.37 +/- 0.56%, Delta 0.17 +/- 0.83%), and also the predicted pathway acetyl-CoA fermentation to butyrate II (baseline: 0.23 +/- 0.062%, Delta 0.035 +/- 0.059%), compared with the RW intervention (P values <0.05). A change in Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group was positively correlated with the change in liver fat, in both the WGW (rho = 0.54; P = 0.026) and RW (rho = 0.67; P = 0.024) groups. CONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged overweight and obese adults, a 12-wk WGW intervention increased the relative abundance of a number of bacterial taxa from the family Ruminococcaceae and increased predicted fermentation pathways when compared with an RW intervention. Potential protective health effects of replacement of RW by WGW on metabolic organs, such as the liver, via modulation of the microbiota, deserve further investigation.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02385149."

Thus, we evaluated the effect of the consumption of yacon flour on these variables. METHODS: Twenty-six excess body weight (30.4 +/- 2.4 kg/m(2)) adults (31.3 +/- 8.5y) were randomized to one of two groups (yacon flour or control; n = 13) on a double blind clinical trial. Subjects received a breakfast drink containing or not yacon flour (25g) associated with an energy restricted diet, for six weeks. The flour chemical characterization, FOS and total phenolics contents were evaluated. Antioxidant capacity was evaluated in vitro and in vivo (plasma). Intestinal permeability, fecal SCFA, oxidative stress and inflammatory markers also were evaluated in vivo. RESULTS: Yacon flour was well tolerated. It presented an in vitro and in vivo antioxidant capacity, increased plasma total antioxidant capacity (Delta(YAC): 49.16 (-4.20; 156.63)) and reduced protein carbonyl concentrations (Delta(YAC): -0.98 (-1.54; -0.42)). A reduction in SCFAs was observed in both groups (Delta(acetic): -3.16 (-5.07; -0.95) vs. -1.05 (-2.65; 1.11); Delta(propionic): -1.05 (-2.60;-0.38) vs. -0.41 (-2.08; 0.09); Delta(butyric) -0.75 (-1.38; -0.04) vs. -0.28 (-0.98; 0.11), for YAC and CON, respectively). Other variables did not change. CONCLUSION: The yacon flour increased the plasma antioxidant capacity, decreased oxidative stress and SCFAs in adults with obesity or overweight."
"Effects on childhood infections of promoting safe and hygienic complementary-food handling practices through a community-based programme: A cluster randomised controlled trial in a rural area of The Gambia.","Manaseki-Holland S||Manjang B||Hemming K||Martin JT||Bradley C||Jackson L||Taal M||Gautam OP||Crowe F||Sanneh B||Ensink J||Stokes T||Cairncross S","PLoS medicine","10.1371/journal.pmed.1003260","18","1","2021","BACKGROUND: The Gambia has high rates of under-5 mortality from diarrhoea and pneumonia, peaking during complementary-feeding age. Community-based interventions may reduce complementary-food contamination and disease rates. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A public health intervention using critical control points and motivational drivers, delivered February-April 2015 in The Gambia, was evaluated in a cluster randomised controlled trial at 6- and 32-month follow-up in September-October 2015 and October-December 2017, respectively. After consent for trial participation and baseline data were collected, 30 villages (clusters) were randomly assigned to intervention or control, stratified by population size and geography. The intervention included a community-wide campaign on days 1, 2, 17, and 25, a reminder visit at 5 months, plus informal community-volunteer home visits. It promoted 5 key complementary-food and 1 key drinking-water safety and hygiene behaviours through performing arts, public meetings, and certifications delivered by a team from local health and village structures to all villagers who attended the activities, to which mothers of 6- to 24-month-old children were specifically invited. Control villages received a 1-day campaign on domestic-garden water use. The background characteristics of mother and clusters (villages) were balanced between the trial arms. Outcomes were measured at 6 and 32 months in a random sample of 21-26 mothers per cluster. There were no intervention or research team visits to villages between 6 and 32 months. The primary outcome was a composite outcome of the number of times key complementary-food behaviours were observed as a proportion of the number of opportunities to perform the behaviours during the observation period at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the rate of each recommended behaviour; microbiological growth from complementary food and drinking water (6 months only); and reported acute respiratory infections, diarrhoea, and diarrhoea hospitalisation. Analysis was by intention-to-treat analysis adjusted by clustering. (Registration: PACTR201410000859336). We found that 394/571 (69%) of mothers with complementary-feeding children in the intervention villages were actively involved in the campaign. No villages withdrew, and there were no changes in the implementation of the intervention. The intervention improved behaviour adoption significantly. For the primary outcome, the rate was 662/4,351(incidence rate [IR] = 0.15) in control villages versus 2,861/4,378 (IR = 0.65) in intervention villages (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 4.44, 95% CI 3.62-5.44, p < 0.001), and at 32 months the aIRR was 1.17 (95% CI 1.07-1.29, p = 0.001). Secondary health outcomes also improved with the intervention: (1) mother-reported diarrhoea at 6 months, with adjusted relative risk (aRR) = 0.39 (95% CI 0.32-0.48, p < 0.001), and at 32 months, with aRR = 0.68 (95% CI 0.48-0.96, p = 0.027); (2) mother-reported diarrhoea hospitalisation at 6 months, with aRR = 0.35 (95% CI 0.19-0.66, p = 0.001), and at 32 months, with aRR = 0.38 (95% CI 0.18-0.80, p = 0.011); and (3) mother-reported acute respiratory tract infections at 6 months, with aRR = 0.67 (95% CI 0.53-0.86, p = 0.001), though at 32 months improvement was not significant (p = 0.200). No adverse events were reported. The main limitations were that only medium to small rural villages were involved. Obtaining laboratory cultures from food at 32 months was not possible, and no stool microorganisms were investigated. CONCLUSIONS: We found that low-cost and culturally embedded behaviour change interventions were acceptable to communities and led to short- and long-term improvements in complementary-food safety and hygiene practices, and reported diarrhoea and acute respiratory tract infections. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered on the 17th October 2014 with the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry in South Africa with number (PACTR201410000859336) and 32-month follow-up as an amendment to the trial."
"Influence of Temperature and Precipitation on the Effectiveness of Water, Sanitation, and Handwashing Interventions against Childhood Diarrheal Disease in Rural Bangladesh: A Reanalysis of the WASH Benefits Bangladesh Trial.","Nguyen AT||Grembi JA||Riviere M||Barratt Heitmann G||Hutson WD||Athni TS||Patil A||Ercumen A||Lin A||Crider Y||Mertens A||Unicomb L||Rahman M||Luby SP||Arnold BF||Benjamin-Chung J","Environmental health perspectives","10.1289/EHP13807","132","4","2024","BACKGROUND: Diarrheal disease is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality globally. Household water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) interventions can reduce exposure to diarrhea-causing pathogens, but meteorological factors may impact their effectiveness. Information about effect heterogeneity under different weather conditions is critical to refining these targeted interventions. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether temperature and precipitation modified the effect of low-cost, point-of-use WASH interventions on child diarrhea. METHODS: We analyzed data from a trial in rural Bangladesh that compared child diarrhea prevalence between clusters (N = 720) that were randomized to different WASH interventions between 2012 and 2016 (NCT01590095). We matched temperature and precipitation measurements to diarrhea outcomes (N = 12,440 measurements, 6,921 children) by geographic coordinates and date. We estimated prevalence ratios (PRs) using generative additive models and targeted maximum likelihood estimation to assess the effectiveness of each WASH intervention under different weather conditions. RESULTS: Generally, WASH interventions most effectively prevented diarrhea during monsoon season, particularly following weeks with heavy rain or high temperatures. The PR for diarrhea in the WASH interventions group compared with the control group was 0.49 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.68) after 1 d of heavy rainfall, with a less-protective effect [PR = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.60, 1.25)] when there were no days with heavy rainfall. Similarly, the PR for diarrhea in the WASH intervention group compared with the control group was 0.60 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.75) following above-median temperatures vs. 0.91 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.35) following below-median temperatures. The influence of precipitation and temperature varied by intervention type; for precipitation, the largest differences in effectiveness were for the sanitation and combined WASH interventions. DISCUSSION: WASH intervention effectiveness was strongly influenced by precipitation and temperature, and nearly all protective effects were observed during the rainy season. Future implementation of these interventions should consider local environmental conditions to maximize effectiveness, including targeted efforts to maintain latrines and promote community adoption ahead of monsoon seasons. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13807."
"Impact of supplementing Limosilactobacillus fermentum MN-LF23 on the eradication of Helicobacter pylori with 14-day standard quadruple therapy: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","Zhao Y||Niu X||Zhang Y||Zhao L||Zhang L||He J||Zhang Q||Mao Y||Wang F||Zhao X||Wang R","Nutrition journal","10.1186/s12937-025-01124-6","24","1","2025","BACKGROUND: The effect of probiotics on Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection demonstrates considerable heterogeneity. This study aims to elucidate the role of Limosilactobacillus fermentum MN-LF23 (MN-LF23) in Hp-infected populations. METHODS: A total of 94 adult patients with confirmed Hp infection were enrolled in this study and randomly allocated to the placebo or MN-LF23 group. Patients initially received either placebo or probiotics along with standard quadruple therapy for 2 weeks, followed by continued administration of either placebo or probiotics for an additional 4 weeks. The eradication of Hp, serum levels of inflammatory factors, and alterations in gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed at weeks 0, 2, and 6, while fecal samples were collected for metagenomic sequencing. RESULTS: The results showed no significant difference (P = 1) in the eradication rate between the placebo group (85.11%) and the probiotic group (82.98%). Following treatment, the incidence of constipation, dyspepsia, and Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) scores in the probiotic group were markedly lower (P < 0.05) compared to those observed in the placebo group. Throughout the treatment process, there were no significant differences in TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels between the two groups. Compared to the placebo group, the probiotic group exhibited a significant increase in beneficial bacteria such as Limosilactobacillus fermentum, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium longum, Coprococcus caltus, and Clostridium butyricum. CONCLUSION: MN-LF23 supplementation did not improve the eradication rate of standard quadruple therapy. However, it significantly reduced the overall GSRS score, improved digestive and constipation symptoms, and promoted the proliferation of beneficial bacteria in the intestine."

Here, we aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using commercially-available anaerobic cultivated human intestinal microbiota (ACHIM) in SSc. METHODS: Ten patients with SSc were randomized to ACHIM (n = 5) or placebo (n = 5) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled 16-week pilot. All patients had mild to severe upper and lower GI symptoms including diarrhea, distention/bloating and/or fecal incontinence at baseline. Gastroduodenoscopy transfer of ACHIM or placebo was performed at weeks 0 and 2. Primary endpoints were safety and clinical efficacy on GI symptoms assessed at weeks 4 and 16. Secondary endpoints included changes in relative abundance of total, immunoglobulin (Ig) A- and IgM-coated fecal bacteria measured by 16s rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: ACHIM side effects were mild and transient. Two placebo controls experienced procedure-related serious adverse events; one developed laryngospasms at week 0 gastroduodenoscopy necessitating study exclusion whilst one encountered duodenal perforation during gastroduodenoscopy at the last study visit (week 16). Decreased bloating, diarrhea and/or fecal incontinence was observed in four of five patients in the FMT group (week 4 or/and 16) and in two of four in the placebo group (week 4 or 16). Relative abundance, richness and diversity of total and IgA-coated and IgM-coated bacteria fluctuated more after FMT, than after placebo. CONCLUSIONS: FMT of commercially-available ACHIM is associated with gastroduodenoscopy complications but reduces lower GI symptoms by possibly altering the gut microbiota in patients with SSc."

METHODS: A total of 100 infants and children 3-36 months of age with acute diarrhea received medical care according to the World Health Organization guidelines on the management of acute diarrhea in children and were randomly allocated to the probiotic group (S. boulardii CNCM I-3799 at a daily dose of 5 billion CFU twice daily) or to the placebo group. Infants and children were treated for 5 days and an extended follow-up was planned 1 and 2 months after the end of the treatment period. Primary endpoint was the time of recovery from diarrhea defined as the duration of diarrhea. Other parameters, such as frequency and consistency of stools, associated with the severity of diarrhea episodes were defined as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: The administration of S. boulardii CNCM I-3799 was associated with beneficial effects on duration and severity of diarrhea. The time of recovery from diarrhea was significantly shorter in the probiotic group compared with the placebo group (65.8 +/- 12 hours vs. 95.3 +/- 17.6 hours, P = 0.0001). Faster remission in the probiotic group was also demonstrated by a shorter time before the first episode of semisolid stool [-23.5 hours, diff (95% CI): -7.99 (-31.49 to -15.51), P = 0.0001] and the faster normalization of stool consistency. S. boulardii CNCM I-3799 was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: S. boulardii CNCM I-3799 supplementation in children with acute diarrhea was shown effective in reducing the duration and severity of diarrhea in infants and children."

We assessed the efficacy of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BLa80 in maltodextrin as a food supplement in regulating the intestinal habit of subjects with chronic constipation with type 1 or 2 stools on the Bristol scale index and/or less than three stools per week. A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out in subjects aged 18 and over with chronic constipation. The study enrolled forty-six subjects who were randomised one-to-one to receive the potential probiotic in maltodextrin (n = 23) or a placebo (n = 23). Investigators assessed changes in intestinal habits by analysing the mean number of weekly stools and the stool types according to the Bristol Scale. Patients reported constipation symptoms with PAC-SYM (patient assessment of constipation - symptoms), and the impact on quality of life with PAC-QoL (patient assessment of constipation - quality of life) and GI-QLI (gastrointestinal quality of life index). Patients on the intervention group showed a greater tendency to normalise the type of stools than those in the placebo group. This difference towards regular stool types (type 3 and 4) was statistically significant at weeks 8 and 12 relative to week 4 (P-values = 0.006 and 0.027, respectively). The proportion of constipated patients in the experimental group dropped over time, while the rate slightly increased in the placebo group in a statistically significant manner at week 12 relative to week 4 ( P = 0.037). Overall, the present study shows oral intake of B. animalis subsp. lactis BLa80 in maltodextrin for 12 weeks improves intestinal habits in subjects with chronic constipation. Our study provides evidence to the efficacy and safety use of this formulation as an effective tool for improving stool consistency in constipated patients.

This was a randomized, placebo-controlled study. In part A, subjects, including a cohort of elderly subjects (which received DUR at 1 g), received single ascending doses of DUR ranging from 0.25 to 8 g. In part B, multiple ascending doses of DUR ranging from 0.25 to 2 g were administered every 6 h (q6h) for 29 doses. In parts C and D, the drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential, including the safety, of DUR (1 g) with SUL (1 g) and/or IMI-CIL (0.5/0.5 g) was investigated after single and multiple doses. Plasma and urine concentrations of DUR, SUL, and IMI-CIL were determined. Among 124 subjects, DUR was generally safe and well tolerated when it was administered either alone or in combination with SUL and/or IMI-CIL. After single and multiple doses, DUR demonstrated linear dose-proportional exposure across the studied dose ranges. Renal excretion was a predominant clearance mechanism. No drug-drug interaction potential between DUR and SUL and/or IMI-CIL was identified. SUL-DUR at 1 g (of each component) administered q6h with a 3-h intravenous (i.v.) infusion is under development for the treatment of serious infections due to A. baumannii (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT02971423.)."

The potassium-competitive acid blocker vonoprazan is a gastric acid secretion inhibitor that improves the success rate of Hp eradication through its immediate and persistent inhibition of acid excretion. In Japan, first-line treatment involves a regimen in which vonoprazan is combined with amoxicillin and clarithromycin, while second-line treatment involves vonoprazan combined with amoxicillin and metronidazole. However, in contrast to the vonoprazan-based first-line therapy, no studies have investigated the factors influencing the success of vonoprazan-based second-line therapy. In this study, we therefore aimed to investigate factors related to the success of vonoprazan-based second-line therapy. We analyzed the association between the success of Hp eradication and patient factors including metronidazole/amoxicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). MICs were measured using the Hp isolated from each patient. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to examine continuous variables and eradication success. We reviewed the records of 33 patients (age: 34-79 years, male/female: 22/11, and body mass index (BMI): 16.1-28.8 kg/m(2)) who underwent vonoprazan-based second-line therapy after failure of first-line therapy at seven Japanese facilities between October 2018 and June 2019. The eradication success rate was 81.8% (27/33). ROC analysis revealed an area under the curve and BMI cutoff value of 0.796 and 23.8 kg/m(2), respectively. The eradication success rate was higher in patients with high BMI than in those with low BMI (p = 0.007). Our findings indicate that higher BMI is correlated with the success of vonoprazan-based second-line therapy."

We used two protocols, doxycycline-based quadruple regimen and concomitant levofloxacin regimen. The aim was to assess the effectiveness of doxycycline-based quadruple regimen for treating Helicobacter Pylori infections compared with levofloxacin concomitant regimen as empirical first-line therapy based on intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses (PPA) in Syrian population. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: An open-label, randomised, parallel, superiority clinical trial. METHODS: We randomly assigned 78 naive patients who tested positive for Helicobacter Pylori gastric infection, with a 1:1 ratio to (D-group) which received (bismuth subsalicylate 524 mg four times daily, doxycycline 100 mg, tinidazole 500 mg, and esomeprazole 20 mg, each twice per day for 2 weeks), or (L-group) which received (levofloxacin 500 mg daily, tinidazole 500 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg, and esomeprazole 20 mg each twice per day for two weeks). We confirmed Helicobacter Pylori eradication by stool antigen test 8 weeks after completing the treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were allocated in each group. In the D-group, 38 patients completed the follow-up, 30 patients were cured. While in the L-group, 39 completed the follow-up, 32patients were cured. According to ITT, the eradication rates were 76.92%, and 82.05%, for the D-group and L-group respectively. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was 1.371 [0.454-4.146]. According to PPA, the eradication rates were 78.9%, and 82.05% for the D-group and L-group respectively. The odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was 1.219 [0.394-3.774]. We didn't report serious adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Levofloxacin concomitant therapy wasn't superior to doxycycline based quadruple therapy. Further researches are required to identify the optimal first-line treatment for Helicobacter-Pylori Infection in the Syrian population.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a daily oral probiotic combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis BB-12 compared with placebo reduces antibiotic administration in care home residents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of 310 care home residents, aged 65 years and older, recruited from 23 care homes in the United Kingdom between December 2016 and May 2018, with last follow-up on October 31, 2018. INTERVENTIONS: Study participants were randomized to receive a daily capsule containing a probiotic combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis BB-12 (total cell count per capsule, 1.3 x 1010 to 1.6 x 1010) (n = 155), or daily matched placebo (n = 155), for up to 1 year. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was cumulative antibiotic administration days for all-cause infections measured from randomization for up to 1 year. RESULTS: Among 310 randomized care home residents (mean age, 85.3 years; 66.8% women), 195 (62.9%) remained alive and completed the trial. Participant diary data (daily data including study product use, antibiotic administration, and signs of infection) were available for 98.7% randomized to the probiotic group and 97.4% randomized to placebo. Care home residents randomized to the probiotic group had a mean of 12.9 cumulative systemic antibiotic administration days (95% CI, 0 to 18.05), and residents randomized to placebo had a mean of 12.0 days (95% CI, 0 to 16.95) (absolute difference, 0.9 days [95% CI, -3.25 to 5.05]; adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.63]; P = .50). A total of 120 care home residents experienced 283 adverse events (150 adverse events in the probiotic group and 133 in the placebo group). Hospitalizations accounted for 94 of the events in probiotic group and 78 events in the placebo group, and deaths accounted for 33 of the events in the probiotic group and 32 of the events in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among care home residents in the United Kingdom, a daily dose of a probiotic combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis BB-12 did not significantly reduce antibiotic administration for all-cause infections. These findings do not support the use of probiotics in this setting. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Identifier:16392920."

OBJECTIVES: This trial tested the hypothesis that a daily supplement of BC/egg would reduce linear growth faltering and environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) in Malawian infants when compared with an isoenergetic ration of corn/soy flour used as a control. EED was defined by a lactulose permeability test. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which 9-mo-old infants received BC/egg or a control for 3 mo. The primary outcomes were change in length-for-age z-score (DeltaLAZ) and urinary lactulose excretion (%L) at 12-mo-old. Secondary outcomes included episodes of diarrhea, stunting, EED, and the 16S configuration of the fecal microbiota. RESULTS: Of the 277 children enrolled, 267 completed the intervention phase of the study. LAZ decreased in all children from 9 to 17 mo, although DeltaLAZ was less in children receiving BC/egg from 9 to 12 mo (difference = 0.12 z-scores; P = 0.0011). This difference persisted after feeding was completed, with less DeltaLAZ (difference = 0.09 z-scores). A lower prevalence of stunting was seen in the intervention group (n = 47/137) than the control group (n = 62/127) at 17 mo (RR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.94).The median %L at 12 mo of age in the children receiving BC/egg was 0.14%, compared with 0.17% in the control group (P = 0.74). In children with %L >0.45% at enrollment (severe EED), the BC/egg group had more children with normal %L at 12 mo of age (10/20, 50%) than was seen in controls (2/15, 13%; P = 0.024). Episodes of diarrhea and beta-diversity of the 16S configuration of fecal microbiota did not differ between the 2 groups.

The objective of this randomised double blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Prodefen Plus(R) in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) in an adult population requiring either antibiotic treatment for an oral infection or antibiotic prophylaxis for a dental surgical procedure in a dental consultation. 151 subjects were randomised to the active (synbiotic) or control arm (placebo) for 14 days. There was a significantly higher reduction in the AAD incidence, and an improvement in the stool consistency in the active group. A higher reduction in both the frequency and duration of the diarrhoea episodes in the active group was also observed, as it was an improved perception of the diarrhoea severity. Overall, the study medication was well tolerated. In conclusion, results from this study confirm the beneficial effect of the synbiotic administered as adjuvant therapy in preventing the antibiotic-associated diarrhoea."

Although probiotics have been touted as having the potential to expedite diarrhea resolution, recent clinical trials question their effectiveness. A potential explanation is a shift in pathogens following the introduction of a rotavirus vaccine. Here, we report the results of a multi-center, double-blind trial of 816 children with acute gastroenteritis who completed follow-up and provided multiple stool specimens. Participants were randomized to receive a probiotic containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus helveticus or placebo. We report no virus-specific beneficial effects attributable to the probiotic, either in reducing clinical symptoms or viral nucleic acid clearance from stool specimens collected up to 28 days following enrollment. We provide pathophysiological and microbiologic evidence to support the clinical findings and conclude that our data do not support routine probiotic administration to children with acute gastroenteritis, regardless of the infecting virus."
"Faecal microbiota transplant to ERadicate gastrointestinal carriage of Antibiotic-Resistant Organisms (FERARO): A feasibility randomised controlled trial.","Merrick B||Prossomariti D||Allen E||Bisnauthsing K||Kertanegara M||Sergaki C||Le Guennec AD||Delord M||Bell JT||Conte MR||Moyes DL||Shankar-Hari M||Douiri A||Goodman AL||Shawcross DL||Goldenberg SD","The Journal of infection","10.1016/j.jinf.2025.106504","91","1","2025","OBJECTIVES: The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is a reservoir of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO). Colonisation with MDRO precedes invasive infections, which can be challenging to treat with excess morbidity and mortality compared to antimicrobial-susceptible infections. Currently, there are no effective GIT decolonisation strategies. Whilst faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has emerged as a potential therapeutic, there remains uncertainty about its feasibility, safety, and efficacy. METHODS: Population: Patients with invasive infection with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL-) or carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and persistent GIT carriage. INTERVENTION: Three doses of encapsulated lyophilised FMT. COMPARATOR: Matched placebo capsules. OUTCOMES: Primary outcome was participant consent rate as a proportion of those approached to be screened for GIT carriage of ESBL-E/CRE. Secondary outcomes were additional feasibility, safety and tolerability, and efficacy metrics. Exploratory outcomes included stool metagenomic analysis. RESULTS: Of 460 approached individuals, 124 (27%) consented. 53/124 participants (43%) fulfilled all eligibility criteria. 44/53 (83%) of those eligible were randomised and 41/44 (93%) received investigational medicinal product (IMP): 20 FMT and 21 placebo. 39/41 (95%) completed IMP dosing. Abdominal bloating and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were more common following FMT, but there were no unanticipated harms. MDRO carriage decreased over time across arms but was lower at all time points in the FMT arm. FMT increased microbiome diversity and microbiome-based health measures. FMT recipients' samples clustered into two groups, with those with more dissimilar community composition to donors more likely to decolonise post-FMT (3/5 vs. 0/12, p = 0.01). Patients that decolonised exhibited a trend towards increased proportional representation of donor-derived strains in their post-FMT samples (p = 0.05) and change in strain dominance within MDRO at the species-level. CONCLUSIONS: Progression to a substantive trial is feasible with modifications to the existing FERARO protocol. FMT was safe, well tolerated, and acceptable to patients colonised with MDRO. Microbiome analysis infers that greater donor-recipient microbiome dissimilarity at baseline and higher rates of donor-derived strain engraftment favour MDRO decolonisation, which in turn maybe facilitated by conspecific strain replacement."
"Luminal microbiota related to Crohn's disease recurrence after surgery.","Hamilton AL||Kamm MA||De Cruz P||Wright EK||Feng H||Wagner J||Sung JJY||Kirkwood CD||Inouye M||Teo SM","Gut microbes","10.1080/19490976.2020.1778262","11","6","2020","BACKGROUND: Microbial factors are likely to be involved in the recurrence of Crohn's disease (CD) after bowel resection. We investigated the luminal microbiota before and longitudinally after surgery, in relation to disease recurrence, using 16S metagenomic techniques. METHODS: In the prospective Post-Operative Crohn's Endoscopic Recurrence (POCER) study, fecal samples were obtained before surgery and 6, 12, and 18 months after surgery from 130 CD patients. Endoscopy was undertaken to detect disease recurrence, defined as Rutgeerts score >/=i2, at 6 months in two-thirds of patients and all patients at 18 months after surgery. The V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Cluster analysis was performed at family level, assessing microbiome community differences between patients with and without recurrence. RESULTS: Six microbial cluster groups were identified. The cluster associated with maintenance of remission was enriched for the Lachnospiraceae family [adjusted OR 0.47 (0.27-0.82), P = .007]. The OTU diversity of Lachnospiraceae within this cluster was significantly greater than in all other clusters. The cluster enriched for Enterobacteriaceae was associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence [adjusted OR 6.35 (1.24-32.44), P = .026]. OTU diversity of Enterobacteriaceae within this cluster was significantly greater than in other clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Luminal bacterial communities are associated with protection from, and the occurrence of, Crohn's disease recurrence after surgery. Recurrence may relate to a higher abundance of facultatively anaerobic pathobionts from the Enterobacteriaceae family. The ecologic change of depleted Lachnospiraceae, a genus of butyrate-producing bacteria, may permit expansion of Enterobacteriaceae through luminal environmental perturbation."
"Dynamic changes in the gut microbiota after bismuth quadruple therapy and high-dose dual therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication.","Chen J||Zhang Y||Min H||Zhi J||Ma S||Dong H||Yan J||Chi X||Zhang X||Yang Y","Helicobacter","10.1111/hel.13077","29","2","2024","BACKGROUND: A novel regimen with high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) has emerged, but its impact on the gut microbiota is not well understood. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of HDDT on the gut microbiota and compare it with that of bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT). METHODS: We enrolled outpatients (18-70 years) diagnosed with Helicobacter pylori infection by either histology or a positive (13)C-urea breath test ((13)C-UBT) and randomly assigned to either the BQT or HDDT group. Subjects consented to provide fecal samples which were collected at baseline, Week 2, and Week 14. Amplification of the V1 and V9 regions of the 16S rRNA was conducted followed by high-throughput sequencing. RESULTS: Ultimately, 78 patients (41 patients in the HDDT group and 37 in the BQT group) were enrolled in this study. Eradication therapy significantly altered the diversity of the gut microbiota. However, the alpha diversity rebounded only in the HDDT group at 12 weeks post-eradication. Immediately following eradication, the predominance of Proteobacteria, replacing commensal Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, did not recover after 12 weeks. Species-level analysis showed that the relative abundances of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia fergusonii significantly increased in both groups at Week 2. Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis significantly increased in the BQT group, with no significant difference observed in the HDDT group. After 12 weeks of treatment, the relative abundance of more species in the HDDT group returned to baseline levels. CONCLUSION: Eradication of H. pylori can lead to an imbalance in gut microbiota. Compared to BQT, the HDDT is a regimen with milder impact on gut microbiota."

Although the relationship between certain single probiotics and HBC has been explored, the impact of the complex ready-to-eat Lactobacillus paracasei N1115 (LP N1115) supplement on patients with HBC has not been determined. AIM: To compare the changes in the microbiota, inflammatory factor levels, and liver function before and after probiotic treatment in HBC patients. METHODS: This study included 160 HBC patients diagnosed at the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University between October 2018 and December 2020. Patients were randomly divided into an intervention group that received LP N1115 supplementation and routine treatment and a control group that received routine treatment only. Fecal samples were collected at the onset and conclusion of the 12-wk intervention period. The structure of the intestinal microbiota and the levels of serological indicators, such as liver function and inflammatory factors, were assessed. RESULTS: Following LP N1115 intervention, the intestinal microbial diversity significantly increased in the intervention group (P < 0.05), and the structure of the intestinal microbiota was characterized by an increase in the proportions of probiotic microbes and a reduction in harmful bacteria. Additionally, the intervention group demonstrated notable improvements in liver function indices and significantly lower levels of inflammatory factors (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: LP N1115 is a promising treatment for ameliorating intestinal microbial imbalance in HBC patients by modulating the structure of the intestinal microbiota, improving liver function, and reducing inflammatory factor levels."

This study evaluated the effectiveness of CHoBI7 program delivery in increasing handwashing with soap in a healthcare facility setting among diarrhoea patients and their household members. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial of the CHoBI7 program was conducted among 404 diarrhoea patients and their accompanying household members in healthcare facilities in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The 'Standard Message' Arm received the standard message given in Bangladesh to diarrhoea patients on the use of oral rehydration solution. The 'Health Facility Visit + Soapy Water' Arm received the standard message, the CHoBI7 communication module delivered bedside to the patient; and a soapy water bottle in the healthcare facility. The 'Health Facility Visit + Handwashing Station' Arm received this same intervention plus a small plastic handwashing station. Within 24 h of intervention delivery, three-hour structured observation of handwashing practices at stool/vomit- and food-related events (key events) was conducted in healthcare facilities of diarrhoea patients and their accompanying household members. RESULTS: Compared to the Standard Message Arm, there was significantly more handwashing with soap at key events in both the Health Facility Visit + Soapy Water Arm (51% vs. 25 %) (Odds Ratio: 3.02; (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.41, 6.45) and the Health Facility Visit + Handwashing Station Arm (58% vs. 25%) OR: 4.12; (95% CI: 1.86, 9.14). CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that delivery of the CHoBI7 communication module and provision of a soapy water bottle to diarrhoea patients and their accompanying household members presents a promising approach to increase handwashing with soap among this high risk population in a healthcare facility setting in Bangladesh."

The Valentino study showed that de-escalation to single-agent panitumumab after 4-month induction with panitumumab-FOLFOX is inferior to panitumumab-5-FU/LV in patients with RAS wild-type mCRC, although slightly reducing toxicity. We report QoL, a secondary end-point. METHODS: PROs were assessed by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30), EORTC QLQ-CR29, EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaires, at baseline and every 8 weeks until disease progression. First two evaluations correspond to induction treatment (identical in both arms), while subsequent to maintenance. To describe QoL changes over time, mean changes from baseline at each time point were calculated in overall population. To compare maintenance between two arms, mean changes and proportion of improved/stable/worse patients versus baseline were compared for each item. RESULTS: In arm A/B, 91.5%/92.0% of enrolled patients completed questionnaires at baseline. No significant differences in the two arms were reported in compliance, baseline scores and mean changes versus baseline for the three questionnaires during maintenance (24/32/40 weeks). Overall, mean changes versus baseline showed an early deterioration during induction with partial recovering during maintenance for global QoL, functional scales and several symptoms/items of QLQ-C30 (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, appetite loss, diarrhoea) and QLQ-CR29 (body image, dry mouth, hair loss, taste, faecal incontinence, sore skin), and EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score. CONCLUSION: In patients with RAS wild-type mCRC, induction with oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy plus anti-EGFRs induces a transient significant QoL deterioration. After induction phase, treatment deintensification determines an overall recovery of health-related QoL, besides the expected prevention of oxaliplatin-related neurotoxicity."

In animal studies, the positive effect of prebiotics on the improvement of gut barrier parameters has been observed, but the results of human studies to date remain inconsistent. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of twelve-week supplementation of a gluten-free diet (GFD) with prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin (10 g per day) on the intestinal permeability in children with CD treated with a GFD. A pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled nutritional intervention was conducted in 34 children with CD, being on a strict GFD. Sugar absorption test (SAT) and the concentrations of intestinal permeability markers, such as zonulin, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, claudin-3, calprotectin, and glucagon-like peptide-2, were measured. We found that the supplementation with prebiotic did not have a substantial effect on barrier integrity. Prebiotic intake increased excretion of mannitol, which may suggest an increase in the epithelial surface. Most children in our study seem to have normal values for intestinal permeability tests before the intervention. For individuals with elevated values, improvement in calprotectin and SAT was observed after the prebiotic intake. This preliminary study suggests that prebiotics may have an impact on the intestinal barrier, but it requires confirmation in studies with more subjects with ongoing leaky gut."

The gut microbiome plays a role in metabolism and maintaining gut barrier integrity. Studies have found differences in the microbiota between NAFLD and healthy patients and increased intestinal permeability in patients with NAFLD. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can be used to alter the gut microbiome. It was hypothesized that an FMT from a thin and healthy donor given to patients with NAFLD would improve insulin resistance (IR), hepatic proton density fat fraction (PDFF), and intestinal permeability. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with NAFLD were recruited and randomized in a ratio of 3:1 to either an allogenic (n = 15) or an autologous (n = 6) FMT delivered by using an endoscope to the distal duodenum. IR was calculated by HOMA-IR, hepatic PDFF was measured by MRI, and intestinal permeability was tested using the lactulose:mannitol urine test. Additional markers of metabolic syndrome and the gut microbiota were examined. Patient visits occurred at baseline, 2, 6 weeks, and 6 months post-FMT. RESULTS: There were no significant changes in HOMA-IR or hepatic PDFF in patients who received the allogenic or autologous FMT. Allogenic FMT patients with elevated small intestinal permeability (>0.025 lactulose:mannitol, n = 7) at baseline had a significant reduction 6 weeks after allogenic FMT. DISCUSSION: FMT did not improve IR as measured by HOMA-IR or hepatic PDFF but did have the potential to reduce small intestinal permeability in patients with NAFLD."

We aim to evaluate the effects of a Mediterranean diet supplemented with dairy foods on the gut microbiome in Australians at risk of cardiovascular disease. In a randomised controlled cross-over study, 34 adults with a systolic blood pressure >/=120 mmHg and with risk factors for cardiovascular disease were randomly allocated to a Mediterranean diet with 3-4 daily serves of dairy foods (Australian recommended daily intake (RDI) of 1000-1300 mg per day (MedDairy)) or a low-fat (LFD) control diet. Between each 8-week diet, participants underwent an 8-week washout period. Microbiota characteristics of stool samples collected at the start and end of each diet period were determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. MedDairy-associated effects on bacterial relative abundance were correlated with clinical, anthropometric, and cognitive outcomes. No change in the overall faecal microbial structure or composition was observed with either diet (p > 0.05). The MedDairy diet was associated with changes in the relative abundance of several bacterial taxa, including an increase in Butyricicoccus and a decrease in Colinsella and Veillonella (p < 0.05). Increases in Butyricicoccus relative abundance over 8 weeks were inversely correlated with lower systolic blood pressure (r = -0.38, p = 0.026) and positively correlated with changes in fasting glucose levels (r = 0.39, p = 0.019), specifically for the MedDairy group. No significant associations were observed between the altered taxa and anthropometric or cognitive measures (p > 0.05). Compared to a low-fat control diet, the MedDairy diet resulted in changes in the abundance of specific gut bacteria, which were associated with clinical outcomes in adults at risk of CVD."

This analysis of the NRG Oncology RTOG 1203 compared symptom reporting by patients and clinicians during radiotherapy (RT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with cervical or endometrial cancer requiring postoperative RT were randomly assigned to standard 4-field RT or intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). Patients completed the 6-item patient-reported outcomes version of the CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE) for GI toxicity assessing abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fecal incontinence at various time points. Patients reported symptoms on a 5-point scale. Clinicians recorded these AEs as CTCAE grades 1 to 5. Clinician- and patient-reported AEs were compared using McNemar's test for rates > 0%. RESULTS: Of 278 eligible patients, 234 consented and completed the PRO-CTCAE. Patients reported high-grade abdominal pain 19.1% (P < .0001), high-grade diarrhea 38.5% (P < .0001), and fecal incontinence 6.8% more frequently than clinicians. Similar effects were seen between grade >/= 1 CTCAE toxicity and any-grade patient-reported toxicity. Between-arm comparison of patient-reported high-grade AEs revealed that at 5 weeks of RT, patients who received IMRT experienced fewer GI AEs than patients who received 4-field pelvic RT with regard to frequency of diarrhea (18.2% difference; P = .01), frequency of fecal incontinence (8.2% difference; P = .01), and interference of fecal incontinence (8.5% difference; P = .04). CONCLUSION: Patient-reported AEs showed a reduction in symptoms with IMRT compared with standard RT, whereas clinician-reported AEs revealed no difference. Clinicians also underreported symptomatic GI AEs compared with patients. This suggests that patient-reported symptomatic AEs are important to assess in this disease setting."

The gut microbiota of CS-born babies differs to those born vaginally, possibly due to reduced exposure to maternal vaginal bacteria during birth. Vaginal seeding is a currently unproven practice intended to reduce such differences, so that the gut microbiota of CS-born babies is similar to that of babies born vaginally. Our pilot study, which uses oral administration as a novel form of vaginal seeding, will assess the degree of maternal strain transfer and overall efficacy of the procedure for establishing normal gut microbiota development. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Protocol for a single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study of a previously untested method of vaginal seeding (oral administration) in 30 CS-born babies. A sample of maternal vaginal bacteria is obtained prior to CS, and mixed with 5 ml sterile water to obtain a supernatant. Healthy babies are randomized at 1:1 to receive active treatment (3 ml supernatant) or placebo (3 ml sterile water). A reference group of 15 non-randomized vaginal-born babies are also being recruited. Babies' stool samples will undergo whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing to identify potential differences in community structure between CS babies receiving active treatment compared to those receiving placebo at age 1 month (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes include differences in overall gut community between CS groups (24 hours, 3 months); similarity of CS-seeded and placebo gut profiles to vaginally-born babies (24 hours, 1 and 3 months); degree of maternal vaginal strain transfer in CS-born babies (24 hours, 1 and 3 months); anthropometry (1 and 3 months) and body composition (3 months). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval by the Northern A Health and Disability Ethics Committee (18/NTA/49). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences. REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12618000339257)."

In this randomized crossover-controlled study, 30 subjects at CM-risk consumed MF cereal-products, enriched with polyphenols, fibers, slowly-digestible starch, omega-3 fatty acids or Control cereal-products (without bioactive compounds) for 2 months. Metabolic endotoxemia (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein over soluble cluster of differentiation-14 (LBP/sCD14), systemic inflammation and cardiovascular risk markers, intestinal inflammation, CM profile and response to a one-week fructose supplementation, were assessed at fasting and post mixed-meal. GM composition and metabolomic analysis were conducted. Mixed linear models were employed, integrating time (pre/post), treatment (MF/control), and sequence/period. Compared to control, MF intervention reduced intestinal inflammation (fecal calprotectin, p = 0.007) and endotoxemia (fasting LPS, p < 0.05), without alteration of systemic inflammation. MF decreased serum branched-chain amino acids compared to control (p < 0.05) and increased B.ovatus, B.uniformis, A.butyriciproducens and unclassified Christensenellaceae.CAG-74 (p < 0.05). CM markers were unchanged. A 2-month dietary intervention combining multiple bioactive compounds improved intestinal inflammation and induced GM modulation. Such strategy appears as an effective strategy to target low-grade inflammation through multi-target approach."

We studied the effect of Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 (Lc40) on growth and infection incidence of the infants, when the probiotic is administrated to the mothers. Moreover, whether such effects might depend on the interaction between the mother or infant microbiota and the probiotic administration. A total of 291 mother-infant pairs were studied for 16 weeks in a randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled multicentre trial. The Lc40 group (n=139) received 1 capsule/day containing 3x10(9) cfu Lc40; the control group (n=152) received 1 placebo (maltodextrin) capsule/day. A positive and significant correlation of the Staphylococcus load between breast milk and infant faeces was only observed in control group. Additionally, the weight z-score of the infants whose mothers had higher values of Lactobacillus in their breast milk were significantly higher for the Lc40 group. We observed a significant lower incidence of conjunctivitis in the infants whose mothers received Lc40. A higher load of Staphylococcus in infant faeces significantly increased the risk of respiratory infections. Such incidence, under an absent or low Staphylococcus load in the faeces, was significantly 36 times higher in the infants in the control group than in the infants in the Lc40 group. However, the protective effect of Lc40 was gradually reduced as the Staphylococcus load of the milk increased. The administration of Lc40 to nursing women might influence infant growth and health but it seems to depend on its interactions with mother or infant microbiota.

The two methods demonstrated a good quantitative correlation (quantification cycle R(2) = 0.827, P < 0.05). Compared with culture, TAC and Amplidiag each exhibited 96.8% (184/190) sensitivity and identified an additional of 151 and 174 PCR positives in 588 culture-negative stools, respectively. The concordance of stool TAC versus ELISA of ETEC colonies for LT and STh/STp was 85.5% (165/193). TAC demonstrated 98% sensitivity and 92% specificity versus the dot blot results of 793 colonies for the ETVAX CFs CFA/I, CS3, CS5, and CS6. Overall ETEC was detected by TAC in 335 (43.1%) and by Amplidiag in 358 (46.0%) of specimens compared to 190 (24.4%) by culture. We conclude that molecular diagnostic approaches of TAC or Amplidiag increase the detection of ETEC compared with culture, and TAC can also provide vaccine-subtype ETEC data.CLINICAL TRIALSThis study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03729219.IMPORTANCEEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an important cause of childhood and travelers' diarrhea. Vaccines in development utilize specific toxins and colonization factors (CFs) as antigens. Therefore, clinical microbiologic diagnostic methods are needed to discriminate specific toxins and CFs, both for vaccine trials and to guide epidemiology. In this work, we assessed the diagnostic performance of several methods for ETEC: a PCR-based customized TaqMan Array Card (TAC) and the molecular platform Amplidiag on stool and E. coli culture, followed by GM1-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for toxins and dot blot for CFs. Stool samples from a Phase 2b ETEC vaccine trial were used. Overall, ETEC was detected by TAC in 335 (43.1%) and by Amplidiag in 358 samples (46.0%) compared to 190 (24.4%) by culture. TAC additionally provided CF data with 98% sensitivity and 92% specificity. We conclude that the molecular diagnostic approaches of TAC or Amplidiag increase the detection of ETEC compared with culture."
"Microbiota or placebo after antimicrobial therapy for recurrent Clostridioides difficile at home: A clinical trial with novel home-based enrollment.","Drekonja DM||Shaukat A||Zhang JH||Reinink AR||Nugent S||Dominitz JA||Davis-Karim A||Gerding DN||Kyriakides TC","Clinical trials (London, England)","10.1177/17407745211021198","18","5","2021","INTRODUCTION: Clostridiodes difficile infection is the leading cause of infectious diarrhea in the United States, with substantial morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infection is especially challenging, with each recurrence increasing the likelihood of a successive recurrence, leading to cycles of prolonged symptoms, frequent antimicrobial use, and decreased quality of life. Fecal microbiota transplantation to prevent recurrent infection is a promising intervention with a large effect size in observational studies, but with conflicting results from randomized controlled trials. We are conducting a Veterans Affairs-wide randomized controlled trial utilizing centralized case identification, with enrollment and fecal microbiota transplant administration occurring at the participant's home. This type of trial design significantly improves trial efficiency, greatly decreases trial cost, increases consistency of trial administration, and most importantly makes nationwide clinical trials in less-common diseases possible. METHODS: This is a randomized comparison of capsule-delivered fecal microbiota transplant for the prevention of recurrent Clostridiodes difficile infection, administered after successful initial treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection with standard therapy. The primary endpoint is the incidence of recurrent C. difficile infection or death. Cases are identified by searching the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse, with central study coordinators then reaching out to potential participants. Individuals meeting inclusion criteria and interested in participation are scheduled for in-home consent, randomization, and capsule administration, followed by telephone follow-up for 6 months. To mitigate risks of COVID-19, enrollment via video visits has been implemented. RESULTS: A total of 102 participants have been enrolled through January 2021. Centralized case identification and in-home enrollment has facilitated enrollment from 34 unique states, with 38% being from rural or highly rural areas. DISCUSSION: Centralized case identification and in-home enrollment is a feasible and innovative method of conducting randomized controlled trials in the Veterans Affairs system, improving access to clinical research for populations who may have difficulty engaging with the traditional model of clinical trials where enrollment is based at large hospitals in major metropolitan areas."
"The effects of fermented rye products on gut microbiota and their association with metabolic factors in Chinese adults - an explorative study.","Liu Y||Xue K||Iversen KN||Qu Z||Dong C||Jin T||Hallmans G||Aman P||Johansson A||He G||Landberg R","Food & function","10.1039/d1fo01423d","12","19","2021","Rye is among the cereals with the highest content of dietary fibre. A high rye food intake has been associated with improved metabolic risk factors in some but not all observational and intervention studies. Whole-grain rye has also been suggested to affect the gut microbiota in individuals with metabolic syndrome. However, it is yet unclear to what extent effects on the gut microbiota mediate the beneficial metabolic responses of whole-grain rye intake. We hypothesized that a high intake of whole grain rye products containing fermented rye bran (FRB) vs. refined wheat based products (RW) could alter the gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) composition towards a phenotype associated with beneficial metabolic effects in a population not used to such foods. For this purpose, we conducted a post hoc analysis of a 12-week randomized controlled trial in Chinese adults with Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, with 53 participants consuming RW and 31 participants consuming FRB included in the analysis. Anthropometric measurements and fasting blood and fecal sample analyses as well as (13)C-urea breath test were performed at baseline and after a 12-week intervention. At week 12, we observed a higher serum insulin concentration (P-value = 0.038) in the FRB group (n = 31) versus the RW group (n = 53), and this difference was corroborated with alterations in the genus-level relative abundances of the gut microbiota, represented by an increase in Romboutsia and a reduction in Bilophila in the FRB group (n = 22) versus the RW group (n = 46). Compared to the RW group (n = 53), fecal acetic acid concentration was significantly higher in the FRB group (n = 31) at week 12. We also found that fecal acetic and butyric acids positively, while isobutyric, isovaleric and 2-methylbutyric acids inversely, correlated with the gut Romboutsia level among all participants (n = 68) at week 12. We found positive correlations of fecal isobutyric, isovaleric and 2-methylbutyric acids with gut Bilophila (n = 68). In conclusion, our results suggest that the intake of high-fibre rye products could modify gut Romboutsia and Bilophila in a Chinese population with HP infection. These effects are paralleled with favorable modifications of the SCFA concentration and are associated with altered glycemic traits."

The primary outcome was the proportion of observed key events on which hands were washed with soap. Binomial regression analysis calculated prevalence differences between study arms. The intervention had minimal effect on the primary outcome (+2.4%, p = 0.096). The intervention was associated with increased frequency of handwashes without soap before food contact (+13%, p = 0.017). The intervention failed to produce significant changes in handwashing with soap at key times. The low dose delivered (two contact points) may have increased scalability at the cost of effectiveness, particularly in the challenging context of inconvenient water access."

We hypothesized that introduction of prokinetic drug in addition to enemas would improve intestinal motility. Primary outcome: time needed to achieve full enteral feeds and normal stooling pattern. Secondary outcome: day when start of minimal enteral feeding was feasible, necrotizing enterocolitis incidence, length of hospitalization and whether daily meconium evacuation is more effective than evacuation in presence of clinical symptoms only. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted from December 1(st), 2015 until December 1(st), 2016 in level III neonatal unit on 67 preterm infants </=32 gestational weeks and intestinal hypomotility. Infants were allocated to: group 1, treated with saline enemas twice daily until normal stooling pattern was achieved; and group 2, treated with erythromycin and enemas. Infants with intestinal hypomotility, hospitalized from December 1(st), 2014 to December 1(st), 2015, were assigned to group 3, and were treated with enemas only when symptoms of abdominal distension or absence of stool for 48 hours were observed. RESULTS: Total of 127 neonates was included in this study; 33 were assigned to group 1, 34 to group 2, and 60 to group 3. There was no significant difference in number of days needed to reach full enteral feeds: 25 vs. 26 days and normal stooling pattern: 18 vs. 15 between groups 1 and 2. Time needed to achieve full enteral feeds and normal stooling pattern in groups 1 and 2 were significantly shorter when compared to group 3. No difference in length of hospitalization between the groups was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Erythromycin did not improve the patient outcome, although therapy protocol in group 1 and group 2 were more effective than therapy used in patients in group 3."

The human gut is the largest reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB). Individuals colonised with ARB have the potential to spread these organisms both in the community and hospital settings. Infections with ARB such as extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriales (ESBL-E) and carbapenemase producing enterobacteriales (CPE) are more difficult to treat and are associated with an increased morbidity and mortality. Presently, there is no effective decolonisation strategy for these ARB. Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has emerged as a potential strategy for decolonisation of ARB from the human gut, however there is significant uncertainty about the feasibility, effectiveness and safety of using this approach. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Prospective, randomised, patient-blinded, placebo-controlled feasibility trial of FMT to eradicate gastrointestinal carriage of ARB. Eighty patients with a recent history of invasive infection secondary to ESBL-E or CPE and persistent gastrointestinal carriage will be randomised 1:1 to receive encapsulated FMT or placebo. The primary outcome measure is consent rate (as a proportion of patients who fulfil inclusion/exclusion criteria); this will be used to determine if a substantive trial is feasible. Participants will be followed up at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months and monitored for adverse events as well as gastrointestinal carriage rates of ARB after intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics approval was obtained by London-City and East Research Ethics Committee (ref 20/LO/0117).

Limiting the generation of toxic bacterial by-products by manipulating the intestinal microbiota may be a novel strategy for reducing cardiovascular disease in CKD. Rifaximin is a minimally absorbed, oral antibiotic that targets intestinal pathogens and is commonly used as chronic therapy for the prevention of encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of a 10-day course of oral rifaximin 550 mg BID versus placebo on circulating concentrations of gut-derived cardiovascular toxins and proinflammatory cytokines in patients with stage 3-5 CKD (n=38). The primary clinical outcome was change in serum trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) concentrations from baseline to study end. Secondary outcomes included change in serum concentrations of p-cresol sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, kynurenic acid, deoxycholic acid, and inflammatory cytokines (C-reactive protein, IL-6, IL-1beta), and change in composition and diversity of fecal microbiota. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were randomized to each of the rifaximin and placebo arms, with n=17 and n=14 completing both study visits in these respective groups. We observed no difference in serum TMAO change (post-therapy minus baseline TMAO) between the rifaximin and placebo groups (mean TMAO change -3.9+/-15.4 for rifaximin versus 0.5+/-9.5 for placebo, P=0.49). Similarly, we found no significant change in serum concentrations for p-cresol sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, kynurenic acid, deoxycholic acid, and inflammatory cytokines. We did observe differences in colonic bacterial communities, with the rifaximin group exhibiting significant decreases in bacterial richness (Chao1, P=0.02) and diversity (Shannon H, P=0.05), along with altered abundance of several bacterial genera. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term rifaximin treatment failed to reduce gut-derived cardiovascular toxins and inflammatory cytokines in patients with CKD.

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 120 toddlers with respiratory illness were randomly assigned to the probiotic (YLGB-1496) or control group for a 12-week intervention. Follow-up examinations were conducted at baseline (week 0) and at weeks 6 and 12 of the intervention. Toddlers' height and weight were measured by trained personnel, and defecation characteristics and gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded by parents or guardians. Stool samples were collected to determine the fecal pH, fecal calprotectin (FC) concentration, and fecal alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) concentration. Results: A total of 115 toddlers completed the 12-week intervention (58 in the YLGB-1496 group and 57 in the control group). The height-for-age Z score (HAZ) in the YLGB-1496 group was significantly greater than that in the control group (p = 0.006). The weight-for-age Z score (WAZ) in the YLGB-1496 group increased between weeks 6 and 12, whereas the WAZ in the control group continuously decreased during the intervention. No differences in the frequency or consistency of defecation between the groups were observed. Toddlers in the YLGB-1496 group had lower incidences of poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomachache, lower abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dehydration (p < 0.05) but higher fecal AAT concentrations (p = 0.008) than did those in the control group. No differences in the fecal pH or FC concentration were observed between the groups. Conclusions: B. infantis YLGB-1496 demonstrated excellent safety and tolerability in toddlers and effectively reduced the gastrointestinal discomfort associated with respiratory illnesses."

We hypothesised that TXYF would improve clinical responses among patients with IBS-D. DESIGN: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II, superiority trial. SETTING: Outpatients attending the Fangshan Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China. PARTICIPANTS: 96 eligible participants included men and women ranging from late adolescence to middle adulthood (18-65 years), diagnosed with IBS-D according to the Rome IV criteria. In addition, they were required to have an irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) of at least 75. INTERVENTIONS: TXYF granules (3.7 g) twice daily (taken orally before meals) or placebo for 8 weeks. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was the response rate measured by the change in IBS-SSS compared with baseline at week 8. Secondary outcomes included stool frequency; stool consistency at weeks 4, 8 and 20; and quality of life, anxiety and depression at week 8; and safety was monitored throughout the trial. RESULTS: The TXYF and placebo groups each comprised 48 participants. The response rate was not significantly different at week 8 between the two groups (the unadjusted treatment effect estimate (intention-to-treat analysis) was 1.12 (95% CI (0.89, 1.41)), p=0.348). Both groups had a high and similar rate of symptom reduction (79.2% (38/48) vs 70.8% (34/48)). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on secondary outcomes, although both groups showed substantial improvements. Adverse events in the TXYF and placebo groups were one (sinus arrhythmia) and two (elevated transaminases, weakly positive faecal occult blood), respectively. No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Despite showing clinically meaningful improvements in IBS-D symptoms and a reasonable safety profile after 8 weeks, no significant differences were observed between the TXYF and placebo groups. This suggests that the severity of IBS-D symptoms in both treatment arms might have decreased over time, regardless of the treatment, and highlights the need to investigate the relationship between IBS-D and patient psychology. Future large-scale, rigorously designed trials with longer treatment and follow-up periods are essential to evaluate the therapeutic effects and safety of TXYF, and to explore the psychological factors.

The human gut microbiota is related to health and disease including hypertension. Alterations in gut microbiota composition can change the short-chain fatty acid profile released by the bacteria and contribute to hypertension and metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if the composition of the gut microbiota is altered in women who develop late-onset preeclampsia. In this study, we investigated the composition of the gut microbiota at 28 weeks gestation in women who developed late-onset (>34 weeks gestation) preeclampsia (DPE) by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of fecal samples obtained from 213 pregnant women in the SPRING cohort (Study of Probiotics IN Gestational diabetes). Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess the density of butyrate-producing genes. Gut microbiota composition was compared between women with and without DPE. The abundance of the butyrate-producing Coprococcus genus significantly decreased in DPE. Abundance of Coprococcus is significantly and positively correlated with the abundance of genes encoding the terminal step in bacterial butyrate formation (but and buk). Women with DPE also had significantly reduced levels of serum butyrate prior to the development of symptoms than controls. This study suggests that a reduction in the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, and Coprococcus spp. in particular, may contribute to an increased risk of developing preeclampsia in pregnant women."

Fosfomycin (FOS) is an attractive alternative for prophylaxis because it does not interact with immunosuppressants; although 90% is excreted unchanged in the urine, it does not require adjustment for renal function for single dose prophylaxis. METHODS: RTRs were recruited into this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive one 4 g dose of FOS disodium intravenously 3 h (FOS group) or placebo (placebo group) before placement and removal of a urinary catheter and before removal of a double-J ureteral stent. All participants received prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The main outcome was a comparison of the mean number of symptomatic UTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) episodes per patient during a 7-week follow-up period. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NTC03235947. RESULTS: Eighty-two participants were included (41 in the FOS group and 41 in placebo group). The mean number of AB or symptomatic UTI episodes per patient was lower in the FOS group [intention-to-treat (ITT) 0.29 versus 0.60, P = 0.04]. The incidence of symptomatic UTI was lower in the FOS group (ITT, 7.3% versus 36.6%, P = 0.001), and there was no difference in the incidence of AB between both groups. The incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: FOS addition is an effective and safe strategy to reduce the number of symptomatic UTIs during the first 7 weeks after renal transplant."

The main energy sources for colonic bacteria are dietary polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. These play a major role in modulating gut microbial composition and metabolism, which in turn can impact on health outcomes. RESULTS: We investigated the influence of wheat bran arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOS) and maltodextrin supplements in modulating the composition of the colonic microbiota and metabolites in healthy adults over the age of 60. Male and female volunteers, (n = 21, mean BMI 25.2 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2)) participated in the double-blind, cross over supplement study. Faecal samples were collected for analysis of microbiota, short chain fatty acids levels and calprotectin. Blood samples were collected to measure glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides levels. There was no change in these markers nor in calprotectin levels in response to the supplements. Both supplements were well-tolerated by the volunteers. Microbiota analysis across the whole volunteer cohort revealed a significant increase in the proportional abundance of faecal Bifidobacterium species (P </= 0.01) in response to AXOS, but not maltodextrin, supplementation. There was considerable inter-individual variation in the other bacterial taxa that responded, with a clear stratification of volunteers as either Prevotella-plus (n = 8; > 0.1% proportional abundance) or Prevotella-minus (n = 13; </=0.1% proportional abundance) subjects founded on baseline sample profiles. There was a significant increase in the proportional abundance of both faecal Bifidobacterium (P </= 0.01) and Prevotella species (P </= 0.01) in Prevotella-plus volunteers during AXOS supplementation, while Prevotella and Bacteroides relative abundances showed an inverse relationship. Proportional abundance of 26 OTUs, including bifidobacteria and Anaerostipes hadrus, differed significantly between baseline samples of Prevotella-plus compared to Prevotella-minus individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The wheat bran AXOS supplementation was bifidogenic and resulted in changes in human gut microbiota composition that depended on the initial microbiota profile, specifically the presence or absence of Prevotella spp. as a major component of the microbiota. Our data therefore suggest that initial profiling of individuals through gut microbiota analysis should be considered important when contemplating nutritional interventions that rely on prebiotics.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively analyzed data that randomized 157 patients within two groups: (G1) TAP according to rectal swab performed 10 days before PB; (G2): empirical antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin. Prevalence of FQRE digestive carriage and risk factors were investigated. Incidence of infectious complications after (TRUS-BP) in each group was compared. RESULTS: G2 included 80 patients versus 77 in G1. There was no difference between the two groups regarding age, diabetes, prostate volume, PSA, number of biopsy cores, and risk factors for FQRE. In G2, the prevalence of FQRE digestive carriage was 56.3% all related to E. coli species. In the case of digestive carriage of FQRE, TAP according to the rectal swab culture with third-generation cephalosporins was performed in 73.3%. Patients with FQRE had history of FQ use within the last 6 months in 17.8% (p = 0.03). Rate of febrile urinary tract infection after PB was 13% in G1 and 3.8% in G2 (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of FQ resistance in the intestinal flora of our local population was prevalent. Risk factor for resistance was the use of FQ within the last 6 months. TAP adapted to rectal swab, mainly with third-generation cephalosporins, significantly reduced the rate of infectious complications after (TRUS-BP)."

Serum IL-17A increased significantly in Mastiha group (p = 0.006), and the mean change differed significantly between Mastiha and placebo (p = 0.003) even after adjusting for age, sex and BMI (p = 0.001) in inactive patients. In inactive UC patients IL-17A decreased significantly only in placebo (p = 0.033). No significant differences were detected in active disease. Faecal metabolomics indicated that intervention with Mastiha influenced considerably the metabolic profile of IBD patients in remission exhibiting, in between others, increased levels of glycine and tryptophan. Glycine has been proposed to have a therapeutic effect against IBD, while tryptophan derivatives are involved in immunoregalutory mechanisms, such as the Th17 cells differentiation. Thus, it is quite possible that the immunoregulatory role of Mastiha in quiescent IBD involves the regulation of Th17 cells function and differentiation."
"Randomised clinical trial: a 12-strain bacterial mixture versus faecal microbiota transplantation versus vancomycin for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections.","Rode AA||Chehri M||Krogsgaard LR||Heno KK||Svendsen AT||Ribberholt I||Helms M||Engberg J||Schonning K||Tvede M||Andersen CO||Jensen US||Petersen AM||Bytzer P","Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics","10.1111/apt.16309","53","9","2021","BACKGROUND: A defined bacterial mixture could be a safer alternative to faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). AIMS: To compare the efficacy of a 12-strain mixture termed rectal bacteriotherapy with either FMT or vancomycin for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in an open-label 3-arm randomised controlled trial. METHODS: We screened all individuals positive for C difficile from May 2017 to March 2019. Persons with laboratory-confirmed recurrent CDI were included. Before FMT and rectal bacteriotherapy, we pre-treated with vancomycin for 7-14 days. Rectal bacteriotherapy was applied by enema on three consecutive days and FMT by enema once with possible repetition for two to three infusions within 14 days. The vancomycin group was treated for 14 days with additional five weeks of tapering for multiple recurrences. The primary outcome was clinical cure within 90 days. A secondary outcome was 180-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Participants in the FMT group (n = 34) were cured more often than participants receiving vancomycin (n = 31), 76% vs 45% (OR 3.9 (1.4-11.4), P < 0.01) or rectal bacteriotherapy (n = 31), 76% vs 52% (OR 3.0 (1.1-8.8), P = 0.04). Rectal bacteriotherapy and vancomycin performed similarly (P = 0.61). The mortality rate was 6% in the FMT group, 13% in the bacteriotherapy group and 23% in the vancomycin group. FMT tended to reduce mortality compared with vancomycin, OR 0.2 (0.04-1.12), P = 0.07. CONCLUSIONS: Rectal bacteriotherapy appears as effective as vancomycin but less effective than 1-3 FMTs. FMT by enema with 1-3 infusions is superior to vancomycin for treating recurrent C difficile infections and might reduce mortality."
"Novel MAXPOWER biological antibacterial liquid for eradicating oral Helicobacter pylori.","Lai Y||Dong X||Song Y||Zhao J||Du Y||Li Z","BMC infectious diseases","10.1186/s12879-024-09424-8","24","1","2024","BACKGROUND: Eradication of oral Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) not only reduces the infection rate from the transmission route but also improves the success rate of intragastric eradication. MAXPOWER Biological Bacteriostatic Liquid, developed in our previous work, is a composite biological preparation with strong antibacterial ability and unique antibacterial mechanism. The present study evaluated the efficacy of the MAXPOWER biocontrol solution on H. pylori and its success rate in eradicating oral H. pylori in clinical patients. METHODS: Live-dead cell staining and hemolysis test were used to evaluate the cellular safety of MAXPOWER biocontrol solution; plate spreading, live-dead bacterial staining, and scanning electron microscopy methods were used to evaluate its antimicrobial effect against H. pylori. Transcriptomics was used to analyze the changes in H. pylori genes before and after treatment. After seven days of gavage treatment, H&E staining and mice feces were collected for 16SrDNA sequencing to evaluate the animals' safety. Oral H. pylori-positive patients were randomized to be given a placebo and MAXPOWER Bio-Bacteriostatic Liquid gargle for seven days to evaluate the effect on oral H. pylori eradication. RESULTS: In vitro tests demonstrated that this product has excellent biocompatibility and hemocompatibility and can effectively eradicate oral H. pylori. In vivo tests further showed that it has good biosafety and virtually no adverse effect on intestinal microflora. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that it kills H. pylori cells mainly by disrupting their cell membranes and metabolism. Additionally, the results of randomized controlled trials on humans disclosed that the oral H. pylori eradication rates achieved by MAXPOWER Biological Antibacterial Liquid were 71.4% and 78.9% according to the intention-to-treat and the per-protocol analysis, respectively. CONCLUSION: MAXPOWER Biological Antibacterial Liquid is both safe and efficacious in the eradication of oral H. pylori. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was retrospectively registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov Trial Registry on 21/09/2023 (NCT06045832)."
"Frequency of Mass Azithromycin Distribution for Ocular Chlamydia in a Trachoma Endemic Region of Ethiopia: A Cluster Randomized Trial.","Lietman TM||Ayele B||Gebre T||Zerihun M||Tadesse Z||Emerson PM||Nash SD||Porco TC||Keenan JD||Oldenburg CE","American journal of ophthalmology","10.1016/j.ajo.2020.02.019","214",NA,"2020","PURPOSE: Annual mass azithromycin distribution significantly reduces the prevalence of ocular Chlamydia trachomatis, the causative organism of trachoma. However, in some areas a decade or more of treatment has not controlled infection. Here, we compared multiple treatment arms from a community-randomized trial to evaluate whether increasing frequency of azithromycin distribution decreases prevalence in the short term. METHODS: Seventy-two communities in Goncha Siso Enesie woreda in the Amhara region of Northern Ethiopia were randomized to 1 of 6 azithromycin distribution strategies: (1) delayed, (2) annual, (3) biannual, (4) quarterly to children only, (5) biennial, or (6) biennial plus latrine promotion. We analyzed data from the 60 communities in the delayed, annual, biannual, quarterly, and biennial distribution arms at the 12-month study visit. Communities in the annual and biennial distribution arm were combined, as they each had a single distribution before any 12-month retreatment. We assessed the effect of increased frequency of azithromycin distribution on ocular chlamydia prevalence. RESULTS: Ocular chlamydia prevalence was significantly different across azithromycin distribution frequency in children (P < .0001) and adults (P < .0001), with lower prevalence associated with higher frequency. Among children, quarterly azithromycin distribution led to a significantly greater reduction in ocular chlamydia prevalence than the World Health Organization-recommended annual treatment prevalence (mean difference -11.4%, 95% confidence interval -19.5 to -3.3%, P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Increased frequency of azithromycin distribution leads to decreased ocular chlamydia prevalence over a short-term period. In some regions with high levels of ocular chlamydia prevalence, additional azithromycin distributions may help achieve local elimination of infection."

The objective of this study was to investigate whether supplementation with a microalgae extract from Tetradesmus obliquus strain Mi175.B1.a (TOME) influences gut health and reduces stress and anxiety in healthy adults experiencing mild to moderate gastrointestinal (GI) distress. Methods: Fifty-six healthy adults (age: 31.9 +/- 7.7 years; body weight: 71.8 +/- 12.6 kg; BMI: 24.6 +/- 2.8 kg/m(2)) were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm clinical trial. Participants were randomly allocated to receive capsules containing either 250 mg/day of TOME or a placebo for four weeks. Primary outcomes included the assessment of GI symptoms using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and Bristol Stool Scale (BSS). Secondary outcomes focused on subjective evaluation of mood, stress, and anxiety, as well as blood pressure responses to sympathetic nervous system activation induced by the cold pressor test (CPT). In addition, stool, plasma, and saliva samples were collected to assess biomarkers associated with stress, sympathetic activation, intestinal permeability, and GI health. 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to analyze changes in gut microbial populations. Results: Daily supplementation for four weeks with TOME was safe and well tolerated in the study population. In addition, TOME significantly reduced GSRS global scores (p = 0.02), as well as constipation (p = 0.05) and indigestion (p = 0.03) subcomponent scores compared to Placebo. There was also a significant increase in Shannon's index before FDR correction (p = 0.05; FDR = 0.12) and stool butyrate level was significantly lower in the TOME group than in Placebo after 4 weeks of supplementation (p = 0.039). Both groups showed a significant reduction in perceived stress scores, but the TOME intervention group also had reduced Negative Affect scores (p < 0.001). In addition, plasma chromogranin A, a stress biomarker, was significantly reduced after TOME intervention (p = 0.03). There were no negative effects on blood lipids or other parameters related to sympathetic activation or cardiovascular health. Conclusions: Overall, these results suggest that 4-week supplementation with T. obliquus strain Mi175.B1.a improves GI symptoms, potentially through effects on the gut microbiota, and may promote positive effects on mental health. Additional research should follow up on mental health outcomes in populations with increased stress and anxiety and investigate mechanisms underlying improvements in GI health.

"A positive diagnostic strategy is safe and saves endoscopies in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A five-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial.","Engsbro AL||Begtrup LM||Haastrup P||Storsveen MM||Bytzer P||Kjeldsen J||Schaffalitzky De Muckadell O||Jarbol DE","Neurogastroenterology and motility","10.1111/nmo.14004","33","3","2021","BACKGROUND: Previously, the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) required exclusion of organic causes by extensive diagnostic testing. Newer guidelines recommend IBS as a positive diagnosis based on symptoms with limited testing. We investigated the long-term safety and impact on use of health resources of a positive diagnostic strategy compared to a strategy of exclusion in patients with symptoms compatible with IBS. METHODS: In 2008-2010, primary care patients aged 18-50 years fulfilling the Rome III criteria for IBS without alarm signals were randomized to a positive diagnostic strategy (limited blood tests, n = 150) or a strategy of exclusion (extensive blood tests, fecal samples for intestinal parasites, and sigmoidoscopy with biopsies, n = 152). At five years, hospital-registered diagnoses and use of health resources including lower endoscopies were retrieved from national registries. Participants provided 5-year data on Rome III criteria for IBS, severity of symptoms, and quality of life. KEY RESULTS: Baseline mean age was 31.4 (SD 9.1) years; 79% were female. No cases of celiac disease, and gastrointestinal or gynecological cancers were diagnosed within five years. Negligible and comparable numbers were diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, benign gynecological conditions, and upper GI conditions in the two groups. The positive diagnosis strategy carried a higher number of lower endoscopies from year 1 to 5 (23 patients versus 13 patients in the exclusion group), but overall saved endoscopies. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: A positive diagnosis of IBS was as safe as a diagnosis of exclusion in a five-year perspective and saved lower endoscopies; the study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov numbers: NCT00659763/NCT01153295."
"Effects of a social norm-based handwashing intervention including handwashing stations, and a handwashing station-only intervention on handwashing with soap in urban Cote d'Ivoire: a cluster randomised controlled trial.","Amon-Tanoh MA||McCambridge J||Blon PK||Kouame HA||Nguipdop-Djomo P||Biran A||Cousens S","The Lancet. Global health","10.1016/S2214-109X(21)00387-9","9","12","2021","BACKGROUND: Diarrhoeal diseases are an important cause of mortality in children younger than 5 years in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to evaluate the effect of three handwashing interventions on handwashing with soap (HWWS) after toilet use. METHODS: In this cluster randomised trial in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, we randomly assigned communal housing compounds (1:1:1) to receive one of three interventions: a theory of normative social behaviour (TNSB) intervention, including provision of handwashing stations; handwashing stations only; and no intervention. The TNSB intervention was designed to shift the outcome expectation associated with HWWS from health to riddance of faeces-related disgust, and to increase the perceived descriptive norm and perceived handwashing publicness. Participants and fieldworkers were masked to the study objectives. The primary outcome was HWWS after toilet use, assessed at 1 month and 5 months follow-ups. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, PACTR201501000892239. FINDINGS: Between April 10 and May 22, 2014, we identified 92 eligible compounds, of which 75 compounds were included. Follow-up data on HWWS were available for 23 compounds for the TNSB group, 25 compounds for the handwashing station-only group, and 25 compounds for the control group. The study ended in April, 2017. Compared with a frequency of 5% (29 of 604 occasions) in the control group, HWWS after toilet use increased to 9% (49 of 557 occasions; adjusted risk ratio 1.89, 95% CI 1.16-3.08) in the handwashing station-only group, and 24% (143 of 588 occasions; 4.82, 3.06-7.59) in the TNSB group, at the 1-month follow-up. The intervention effect was only sustained in the TNSB group (98 [22%] of 450 compounds; 2.68, 1.65-4.34). INTERPRETATION: A social norm-based handwashing intervention combined with disgust-inducing messages, with provision of handwashing stations, was effective at increasing HWWS after toilet use. The provision of handwashing stations alone had little effect. Future studies should investigate whether the same approach, when delivered via mass media, can have a similar effect to the face-to-face delivery used in this study. FUNDING: None."

Infants with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, aged 6-36 months, were randomly assigned to receive once-daily consumption of rice flour containing heat-killed probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L74 or placebo for 12 weeks as supplementary approach to topical treatment. Primary outcome was SCORAD index change from baseline to 12 weeks; secondary outcomes were gut microbiota composition, as evaluated by the analysis of fecal samples, and serum cytokines at baseline and at the end of the intervention period in both groups, and steroid usage over the treatment period and one month after stopping it. V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was sequenced to evaluate changes in the gut microbiota. SCORAD index decreased over the treatment period in both groups. The difference in the SCORAD change was -2.1 (-5.5 to 1.3; p = 0.223) for the experimental vs. the placebo group, not reaching the minimal clinical difference of 8.7 units. The use of topical steroids, measured as finger tips units, decreased from 4 to 16 weeks, in both groups; the reduction was significantly higher in experimental than in placebo group (p value from Wilcoxon rank sum test = 0.031). No significant differences were observed for cytokines levels between groups. The composition of gut microbiota at the phylum and class taxonomic levels resulted very similar, at baseline and after intervention, in both groups. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the relative abundance of bacterial genera between groups. In conclusion, though the heat-killed Lactobacillus paracaseiwas not proved to be effective in reducing the severity of atopic dermatitis, it showed a steroid sparing effect the value of which needs to be further investigated."

Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) from the food and medicinal plant nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus) is known for its antimicrobial activity and is used for the treatment of infections of the draining urinary tract and upper respiratory tract. Against this background, we raised the question of whether a 14 d nasturtium intervention (3 g daily, N = 30 healthy females) could also impact the normal gut microbiota composition. Spot urinary BITC excretion highly correlated with a weak but significant antibacterial effect against Escherichia coli. A significant increase in human beta defensin 1 as a parameter for host defense was seen in urine and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) upon verum intervention. Pre-to-post analysis revealed that mean gut microbiome composition did not significantly differ between groups, nor did the circulating serum metabolome. On an individual level, some large changes were observed between sampling points, however. Explorative Spearman rank correlation analysis in subgroups revealed associations between gut microbiota and the circulating metabolome, as well as between changes in blood markers and bacterial gut species."

CTX prophylaxis reduces mortality and morbidity among people living with HIV in regions with high prevalence of bacterial infections and malaria. The Antiretroviral research for Watoto trial evaluated the effect of stopping versus continuing CTX prophylaxis in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: In this study, 72 HIV-infected Zimbabwean children, on antiretroviral therapy, provided fecal samples at 84 and 96 weeks after randomization to continue or stop CTX. DNA was extracted for whole metagenome shotgun sequencing, with sequencing reads mapped to the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database to identify CTX and other antimicrobial resistance genes. RESULTS: There were minimal differences in the carriage of CTX resistance genes between groups. The dfrA1 gene, conferring trimethoprim resistance, was significantly higher in the continue group (P = 0.039) and the tetA(P) gene conferring resistance to tetracycline was significantly higher in the stop group (P = 0.013). CTX prophylaxis has a role in shaping the resistome; however, stopping prophylaxis does not decrease resistance gene abundance. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were observed in resistance gene carriage between the stop and continue groups. The previously shown multi-faceted protective effects of CTX in antiretroviral research for Watoto trial clinical outcomes are not outweighed by the risk of multi-drug resistance gene selection due to prophylaxis. These findings are reassuring, given current recommendations for long-term CTX prophylaxis among children living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa to decrease mortality and morbidity."

Fecal samples were collected before treatment, 2 weeks and 6 weeks post-treatment, followed by 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Baseline gut microbiota showed no significant differences between groups. Triple therapy caused significant disruptions in alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, microbial composition, and metabolic pathways, while quadruple therapy resulted in minimal changes. Post-treatment, quadruple therapy exhibited higher alpha-diversity, distinct beta-diversity, and greater abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria compared to triple therapy. Metabolic pathway analysis also revealed significant differences between the two therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Triple therapy significantly disrupted gut microbiota balance, whereas quadruple therapy had a milder impact in Hp-infected children, preserving microbial diversity."

We conducted covert hand hygiene observations, hand-rinse sampling for Escherichia coli detection, and a survey on behavioral factors among healthcare workers. The primary outcome is observed handwashing rate. RESULTS: Baseline data included 309 healthcare workers. Trial arms were balanced in hand hygiene adherence, behavioral factors, and E. coli contamination. Hand hygiene adherence was low (12%). E. coli contamination was very high in Burkina Faso (76%) and considerable in Mali (23%). Participants had a high intention to wash their hands (93%) but only a quarter could name all moments for hand hygiene. CONCLUSION: Poor hand hygiene and E. coli contamination in our setting may heighten nosocomial infection risks. Interventions should address knowledge and build on high intentions to perform hand hygiene."

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare anal inserts and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation. DESIGN: This was an investigator-blinded randomized pilot study. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a large tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Adult patients with passive or mixed fecal incontinence were recruited. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the anal inserts or weekly percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation for a period of 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was a 50% reduction of episodes of fecal incontinence per week as calculated by a prospectively completed 2-week bowel diary. Secondary end points were St Mark's incontinence score, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Bowel scores (for bowel pattern, bowel control, and quality of life), use of antidiarrheal agents, estimates of comfort and acceptability. RESULTS: Fifty patients were recruited: 25 were randomly assigned to anal inserts and 25 were randomly assigned to percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation. All completed treatment. A significant improvement of scores in the 2-week bowel diary, the St Mark's scores and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Bowel scores, was seen in both groups after 3 months of treatment. A reduction of >/=50% fecal incontinence episodes was reached by 76% (n = 19/25) by the anal insert group, compared with 48% (n = 12/25) of those in the percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation group (p = 0.04). The St Mark's fecal incontinence scores and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Bowel scores for bowel pattern, bowel control, and quality of life (p = 0.01) suggest similar improvement for each group. LIMITATIONS: A realistic sample size calculation could not be performed because of the paucity of objective prospective studies assessing the effect of the insert device and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Both anal insert and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation improved the symptoms of fecal incontinence after 3 months of treatment. The insert device appeared to be more effective than percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation. Larger studies are needed to investigate this further. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B460.

Their fecal contamination alters natural physicochemical stream characteristics and increases concentrations of fecal bacteria. Providing one of the first-large scale assessments of their impacts, our study identified wild pigs as a source of non-point pollution on both a regional and multi-regional scale within our selected study state through microbial source tracking and traditional water quality assessment. At a multi-regional scale, we found greater median concentrations (mg/L) of nitrate (95.7%; p < 0.001), magnesium (83.3%; p < 0.001), and potassium (84.7%; p < 0.001) in samples from streams with fecal contamination by wild pigs (n = 111) than from streams without (n = 115). Like other non-point pollutants, the effects of wild pigs on water quality are scale-dependent and differ significantly across regions. Finally, at both a regional and multi-regional scale, our study found observably greater Escherichia coli and fecal coliform concentrations in streams with wild pigs, though statistical significance was lost at scale. Future research will be necessary to continue to evaluate the impacts of wild pigs on water quality, especially across different scales. Our findings support continued monitoring of impacts as the density and range of North American wild pig populations continue to increase."
"Bacteriological quality of drinking water and associated factors in Alemwach refugee camp in Dabat District, Northwest Ethiopia","L., Yohannes, Lamrot; B.B., Begna, Biniam Belete; A.A., Yirdaw, Asmare Asrat; M.T., Sergindo, Mihretu Tagesse; A.E., Bezie, Anmut Endalkachew; F., Weldegebriel, Fasika; H., Belay, Hana","Scientific Reports","10.1038/s41598-025-96490-w","15","1","2025","Access to safe drinking water is essential for preventing waterborne diseases and ensuring public health, particularly in refugee camps, where overcrowding and inadequate sanitation pose significant risks. Contaminated drinking water remains a major public health concern, contributing to outbreaks of diarrheal and other infectious diseases. This study assesses the bacteriological quality of drinking water from sources to the point of use and identifies associated factors influencing contamination in Alemwach Refugee Camp, Dabat District, Northwest Ethiopia. A laboratory-supported cross-sectional study was conducted among Alemwach refugees by collecting a total of 435 drinking water samples (10 samples from the reservoir, 2 samples from the public stand well, 1 sample from the deep well, and 422 samples from household storage containers) for bacteriological analysis. Additionally, data were collected from 422 respondents using structured interviewer-based questionnaires and through observation that assessed factors related to the bacteriological quality of drinking water. Binary and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to find associated factors, and variables with a p-value of 0.05 were considered statistically significant variables. This study revealed that 33.3% of water samples from groundwater, 30% of water samples from reservoirs, and 78.9% of water samples from household storage drinking water were contaminated by fecal coliform. The sanitary risk score indicates a high-level risk score of 66.7% for groundwater sources and a 54.5% risk score for household storage containers, representing a medium risk score. Educational status, home-based water treatment practice, type of water storage container, cleanliness of water storage container, types of sanitation facility, and animal contact with households were significantly associated with bacteriological quality of drinking water quality at the point of use. This study reveals substantial fecal coliform contamination in drinking water, particularly at the household level, indicating a high risk of waterborne diseases in Alemwach Refugee Camp. The contamination is influenced by multiple factors, including household education, type of water storage container, type of sanitation facilities, home-based water treatment, animal contact, and container cleanliness. To improve drinking water quality, targeted interventions such as promoting safe water storage, enhancing household water treatment practices, improving sanitation infrastructure, and conducting community education programs on hygiene and water safety are recommended. Regular monitoring and risk assessment of water sources should also be strengthened to ensure sustainable access to safe drinking water."
"The use of wastewater surveillance to estimate SARS-CoV-2 fecal viral shedding pattern and identify time periods with intensified transmission","W., Yang, Wan; E., Omoregie, Enoma; A., Olsen, Aaron; E.A., Watts, Elizabeth A.; H.B., Parton, Hilary B.; E.H.J., Lee, Ellen Hyun Ju","BMC Public Health","10.1186/s12889-025-22306-1","25","1","2025","Background: Wastewater-based surveillance is an important tool for monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it remains challenging to translate wastewater SARS-CoV-2 viral load to infection number, due to unclear shedding patterns in wastewater and potential differences between variants. Objectives: We utilized comprehensive wastewater surveillance data and estimates of infection prevalence (i.e., the source of the viral shedding) available for New York City (NYC) to characterize SARS-CoV-2 fecal shedding pattern over multiple COVID-19 waves. Methods: We collected SARS-CoV-2 viral wastewater measurements in NYC during August 31, 2020 – August 29, 2023 (N = 3794 samples). Combining with estimates of infection prevalence (number of infectious individuals including those not detected as cases), we estimated the time-lag, duration, and per-infection fecal shedding rate for the ancestral/Iota, Delta, and Omicron variants, separately. We also developed a procedure to identify occasions with intensified transmission. Results: Models suggested fecal viral shedding likely starts around the same time as and lasts slightly longer than respiratory tract shedding. Estimated fecal viral shedding rate was highest during the ancestral/Iota variant wave, at 1.44 (95% CI: 1.35 – 1.53) billion RNA copies in wastewater per day per infection (measured by RT-qPCR), and decreased by around 20% and 50-60% during the Delta wave and Omicron period, respectively. We identified around 200 occasions during which the wastewater SARS-CoV-2 viral load exceeded the expected level in any of the city's 14 sewersheds. These anomalies disproportionally occurred during late January, late April—early May, early August, and from late-November to late-December, with frequencies exceeding the expectation assuming random occurrence (P < 0.05; bootstrapping test). Discussion: These estimates may be useful in understanding changes in underlying infection rate and help quantify changes in COVID-19 transmission and severity over time. We have also demonstrated that wastewater surveillance data can support the identification of time periods with potentially intensified transmission."

However, the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in these sediments and seasonal influence remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the presence and temporal distribution of foodborne pathogens, including Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in water-overlying sediments at selected locations in Conococheague Creek. Over a three-year period, sediment samples were analyzed to enumerate total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and generic E. coli. Results indicated a substantial microbial presence, with total coliforms showing the highest average concentrations, particularly during the warmer seasons. Compared to other sampling sites, FIB concentrations were consistently higher at the SS site, a location characterized by low-intensity urban development. Both Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes were detected across all tested sites, with L. monocytogenes observed more frequently than Salmonella spp. Additionally, a higher prevalence of Salmonella spp. was observed during the warmer months, suggesting seasonal influences on its detection. Conversely, L. monocytogenes was detected throughout the year, with a significant increase during the colder seasons. The I81 site, an area dominated by agricultural activities like crops and pasture production, showed higher prevalence of Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes compared to the other two sites, suggesting a greater contamination risk in irrigation water sources. These findings emphasize the need for continuous, year-round monitoring of sediment microbial dynamics across the watershed to safeguard irrigation water quality and minimize the risk of pathogen transmission to fresh produce."

This study investigates the prevalence and intensity of O. viverrini metacercariae in cyprinoid fish from the Nong Han Wetland in Northeast Thailand, and assesses fish abundance and environmental factors influencing parasite distribution. Fish were sampled monthly at eight sites during the rainy (June – October 2024) and dry (November 2024 – March 2025) seasons. Fish species were identified, and their relative abundance and species diversity (Shannon-Wiener index (H′)) were assessed. Cyprinoid fish were digested with 0.25 % pepsin-HCl to detect, identified and quantify O. viverrini metacercariae under a microscope. Concurrent water quality paramteters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and fecal coliform levels) were analyzed to assess their correlation with parasite distribution. A total of 1429 fish from 36 species were collected, with Trichogaster vittatus (Family Belontiidae) being the most abundant. Among 392 cyprinoid fish (Family Cyprinidae) from 11 species (H′ = 1.8), 15.1 % were infected with O. viverrini metacercariae found in 6 species. Cyclocheilichthys apogon showed the significant highest prevalence (20.3 %). Infection intensity was highest in Barbonymus gonionotus and Hampala dispar (6.0 metacercariae/infected fish). Higher fecal coliform levels and proximity to human settlements correlated with infection. Dry season prevalence (17.8 %) and intensity (5.1 ± 2.6) were significantly greater than the rainy season (11.0 % and 2.6 ± 1.1, P ≤ 0.001). A strong correlation existed between fecal coliforms and O. viverrini prevalence (r = 0.981, P ≤ 0.001), with hotspots near human settlements. The findings highlight the influence of fecal contamination, seasonality, and human factors on O. viverrini transmission, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions."

We integrated data from the national COVID-19 dataset, municipal-level socioeconomic indicators, and water quality contaminants (physicochemical and microbiological). Patients were assigned to one of four datasets (groundwater, lentic, lotic, and coastal) based on their municipality of residence. We trained XGBoost models to predict patient death or survival on balanced subsets of each dataset. Hyperparameters were optimized using a grid search and cross-validation, and feature importance was analyzed using SHAP values, point-biserial correlation, and XGBoost metrics. The models achieved strong predictive performance (F1 score > 0.97). Key risk factors included older age (≥50 years), pneumonia, intubation, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease, while outpatient status, younger age (<40 years), contact with a confirmed case, and care in private medical units were associated with survival. Female sex showed a protective trend. Higher socioeconomic levels appeared protective, whereas lower levels increased risk. Water quality contaminants (e.g., manganese, hardness, fluoride, dissolved oxygen, fecal coliforms) ranked among the top 30 features, suggesting an association between environmental factors and COVID-19 mortality."

Since Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) can induce MS-like demyelination, TMEV infection is the most widely used viral model for MS. Although the precise pathophysiology is unknown, altered fecal bacterial populations were associated with distinct immune gene expressions in the CNS. We aimed to determine the role of gut microbiota in TMEV infection by administering an antibiotic cocktail in drinking water before (prophylactic administration) or after (therapeutic administration) TMEV infection. The antibiotic administration reduced total eubacteria, including the phyla Bacillota and Bacteroidota, but increased the phylum Pseudomonadata in feces. Prophylactic administration did not alter TMEV-induced inflammatory demyelination clinically or histologically, without changes in anti-viral IgG1/IgG2c levels or lymphoproliferative responses; therapeutic administration temporarily suppressed the neurological signs. Although antibiotic treatment had minimal effects on TMEV infection, adding metronidazole and ampicillin in drinking water substantially reduced water intake in the antibiotic group of mice, resulting in significant body weight loss. Since dehydration and stress could affect immune responses and gut microbiota, caution should be exercised when planning or evaluating the oral antibiotic cocktail treatment in experimental animals."

This study investigated the spatial and seasonal behavior of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in the Santiago-Guadalajara River Basin (SGRB) using the most probable number (MPN) microbiological quantification technique and measuring the tributary flow rates in the main stem of the river and tributaries. Twenty-five sampling sites were monitored from July 2021 to April 2022. The mean of the microbial counts (MPN/100 mL) at the basin was as follows: total coliforms 2.5 × 107, fecal coliforms 2.2 × 107, and E. coli 2.1 × 107. These FIB values position the Santiago-Guadalajara River as one of the most polluted rivers globally since it significantly exceeds the regulatory limits at the monitored sites, indicating insufficient sanitation infrastructure throughout the basin. A high level of correlation was found between FIB concentrations and monitored stream tributary flows, which allowed modeling the behavior of the FIB with respect to the flow regime throughout the basin. Quantitative microbial risk assessment revealed specific stations with elevated infection risks from Escherichia coli exposure. This field-based study provides valuable insights into the relationship between the variables that influence FIB concentrations in a highly polluted river and the potential risk to the exposed population."
"Modelling Escherichia coli concentrations: 45.6 %–78.1 % of China's rivers show poor microbial water quality","S., Mei, Songtao; K., Wang, Kai; H., Schmitt, Heike; N., Hofstra, Nynke","Environmental Pollution","10.1016/j.envpol.2025.126184","374",NA,"2025","Water quality is under threat due to the presence of pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Escherichia coli (E. coli) serves as an indicator of faecal contamination and the potential presence of other harmful pathogens. Understanding E. coli concentrations helps in assessing the overall health risks associated with waterborne diseases and developing effective water management strategies. Therefore, we developed the first large-scale model, GloWPa-Ecoli C1 to simulate E. coli loads and concentrations in rivers and apply this model to China. The model provides the first comprehensive overview of microbial water quality across China's rivers. The model simulates E. coli concentrations in 2020 to range from 10−1.2 to 106.3 CFU/L, with 45.6 %–78.1 % of rivers exhibiting poor microbial water quality. Major hotspots of E. coli pollution are Haihe, Huaihe and Pearl River Basins. Direct discharge of human faecal waste contributes 80.2 % of the total E. coli load, while directly discharged livestock waste accounts for 13.1 %. To mitigate E. coli pollution in rivers in China, we recommend increasing human faecal waste collection rates, expanding wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) coverage, phasing out primary treatment WWTPs and eliminating direct livestock faecal waste discharge, particularly from smallholder farms. The study underscores the urgent need to improve microbial water quality in China's rivers. The findings provide actionable insights to inform policy development aimed at safeguarding water quality and public health. Furthermore, the modelling approach is applicable to other regions and microorganisms, offering a foundation for developing models to address antibiotic-resistant bacteria and other emerging water quality challenges."

However, this growth is challenged by microbial infections, particularly those caused by the emerging pathogen Aeromonas dhakensis. This study aimed to investigate the microbial community composition across four distinct tilapia farming systems and assess associated water physicochemical parameters, with a focus on detecting the presence of A. dhakensis and elucidating its environmental associations. Water physicochemical parameters were measured to evaluate environmental conditions, microbial communities were characterized through 16S rDNA metabarcoding, and A. dhakensis was detected using both microbiological and molecular approaches. Principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were employed to explore the influence of environmental variables and microbial community dynamics on pathogen occurrence. Our results indicated that floating cages exhibited higher levels of temperature, ammonium, and fecal coliform, while cement tanks showed signs of nutrient accumulation. PCA revealed that both systems were associated with degraded water quality. A total of 45 A. dhakensis strains with distinct fingerprints were isolated. The 16S metabarcoding revealed Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetota as the dominant phyla. Alpha diversity did not differ significantly among pond systems, while beta diversity revealed variations in microbial assemblages across aquaculture systems. CCA identified dissolved oxygen, temperature, macronutrients (phosphate, ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite), and turbidity as significant environmental drivers shaping the microbial community structure across the pond systems. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of environmental factors, particularly dissolved oxygen, temperature, and nutrient levels, in shaping microbial community composition and potentially influencing the presence of pathogenic bacteria such as A. dhakensis. These findings underscore the need for improved environmental management in tilapia aquaculture to mitigate disease risks and support fish health."

The findings indicated that the river water was acidic and the turbidity, Ca2+, Mg2+, DO, Fe, Pb, Hg, Cr, As, aerobic plate count, Escherichia, total, and fecal coliforms were higher than their respective maximum recommended limits. The multivariate analysis indicated illegal mining, geological influences, open defecation and sewerage runoff from waste dumps strongly influenced contaminant sources, transport, and enrichment. The WQI status ranged from 3484 % to 10,525 %, indicating an unsuitable water source for domestic, irrigation, and industrial applications. Children have higher chronic daily exposure to potentially toxic elements compared to adults, and oral exposure to toxic elements was significantly higher than dermal exposure. The cumulative carcinogenic risk exceeded 10−4 and the total non-carcinogenic risk exceeded 1, indicating a high potential for cancer, adverse health risks, and water-related diseases. The pollution and ecological indices indicate a severe contamination water status associated with high ecological sensitivity.

Significant remediation of these water quality impacts has been shown as a result of reductions in wild pig populations due to control efforts; however, the duration of these remediation effects as populations rebound remains unclear. Our study sought to determine the longevity of water quality remediation resulting from wild pig population control efforts. We found that median concentrations of Escherichia coli and fecal coliform (CFU/100 mL) increased by 746% and 159% in the year following the conclusion of removal efforts, resulting in median concentrations of 79% and 159% greater than those observed prior. We also found increased public health risk, with samples exceeding E. coli and fecal coliform guidelines 10% and 12% more often than pre-removal, respectively.

Several studies have indicated that these waterborne diseases can be managed by monitoring pathogens in water using traditional culture-based and molecular techniques. However, these methods have shown several setbacks such as the longer duration for detection and the inability to detect pathogens at low concentrations. Effective management of these diseases requires rapid, sensitive, highly selective, fast, and efficient economic methods to monitor pathogens in water. Since the creation of biosensors, these tools have been applied and shown the ability to detect pathogens at low concentrations. The highlights of biosensor systems are that they are fast, portable, easy to use, highly sensitive, and specific. The capabilities of biosensors have given these tools exposure to be widely applied in detecting pharmaceutical pollutants, pesticides, toxins, residues of detergents, and cosmetics from household activities in soil and water. With such difficulties faced for detecting waterborne pathogens, this review evaluates the effectiveness of technologies for waterborne pathogens detection and their drawbacks. It further highlights biosensors as the current reliable method available for detecting pathogens in water and its future capabilities in sustaining safe potable water."

However, GW is highly susceptible to contamination from anthropogenic activities. In the Bono East region of Ghana, 94 % of solid waste and 89 % of wastewater are disposed of on the roadside without treatment, posing a contamination risk to water resources. Despite the potential for GW contamination in the region, few researchers have assessed GW quality, and none has evaluated the human infectious risk from GW consumption. In this case study, GW quality in the Apaaso-Tafo community in the region was assessed and the infectious health risks posed to consumers were evaluated. Twenty GW samples were collected from ten boreholes. The concentrations of metals (Ca2+, Mg2+ and Fe) were determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy, bacteria (total and faecal coliform) using Multiple Tube Fermentation and Membrane Filter Techniques, and physicochemical qualities using electrometric, titrimetric, argentometric and spectrophotometric methods. The water quality indices (WQI) and the infection probability from drinking the GW were computed. The WQI showed that most (80 %) GW samples are within acceptable limits. Except for the pH, temperature, turbidity and total coliform bacteria, all parameters met the WHO standards. 40 % of the boreholes contained 50 to 500 cfu/100 mL of coliform bacteria and posed daily infection risks between 1 and 7.63 %. It is recommended that standpipes on boreholes be fitted with membrane or nano filters capable of removing bacteria and viruses to reduce infection risk. The authorities should also monitor GW quality regularly and respond to changes in quality with the appropriate intervention such as issuing ‘boil-before-drinking’ notices to consumers or encouraging parents to provide bottled and sachet water for their young children. Future research with an increased number of communities, sample size and sampling frequency should also be conducted to enhance the generalisability of these findings."

Pseudomonas aeruginosa was abundant in conventional shower biofilms, detectable in shower effluents at concentrations in the range of 2–4 logs CFU/100 mL and ranked among the top five etiological agents of waterborne outbreaks. Consequently, P. aeruginosa is considered as a significant reference pathogen for assessing water quality in recirculating shower systems. A diverse range of Legionella species, particularly Legionella pneumophila, are the primary cause of waterborne outbreaks, and persist in conventional shower biofilms. Therefore, we consider it to be significant as an indicator species in monitoring water quality. Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium spp., and fungi such as Candida albicans could serve as supplementary microbial parameters. Trace organisms such as protozoa (Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp.) and model viruses are also recommended for assessing treatment efficacy. In conclusion, while further research is required to validate these findings, this review critically evaluates relevant pathogens, creating the basis for future microbial water quality assessments in recirculating showers."
"Surface Water Analysis for Physical Parameters, Fecal Indicator Bacteria, and Identification of the Origin of Contamination","S., Tagar, Sadaf; N.A., Qambrani, Naveed Ahmed; Z., Ahmed, Zubair; K., Ansari, Kamran; R.B., Mahar, Rasool Bux; M., Muqeet, Muhammad; S.M.Z., Zaidi, Syed Muhammad Zaki","Water, Air, and Soil Pollution","10.1007/s11270-024-07712-2","236","2","2025","The prevalence of fecal indicator bacteria in relation to physical parameters were observed twice a year in selected points of the Indus River. Eight representative sampling locations were selected, and samples were collected twice a year, i.e., in the dry and wet seasons, for a total of 16 samples. The fecal coliform (FC) to fecal streptococci (FS) ratio was used to identify the source of fecal contamination. Results showed severe fecal contamination levels exceeding the allowable limits of WHO and Pak-EPA. Except for pH and TDS, the physical parameters were also not found within allowable limits at various sampling locations. The comparison of dry and wet seasons reveals higher microbial loads in the wet season. The FC/FS ratio linked polluted waters to human sources (37.5%), animal sources (25%), mixed pollution with the dominance of human pollution (25%), and mixed pollution with the dominance of domestic pollution (12.5%) in dry and human sources (25%), animal sources (25%), mixed pollution with the dominance of human pollution (37.5%) and mixed pollution with the dominance of domestic pollution (12.5%) in wet season. Pearson’s correlation test showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.71 to 0.99) between TDS and salinity in both dry and wet seasons, and a moderately strong correlation (r = 0.41 to 0.70) between various microbial and physical parameters. It is strongly advised that careless municipal wastewater disposal into rivers be prohibited. To prevent contaminated water from mixing with river water, an appropriate sewage and drainage system should be implemented."

Open air markets, while providing fresh and affordable foods, often have unhygienic practices that may contribute to contamination during the slaughter and processing of chicken meat. This study examines whether and how the common practice of rinse water (stored water used for rinsing broiler carcasses during processing) reuse leads to accumulation of pathogens, with potential cross contamination of chicken meat. To assess the accumulation of Campylobacter jejuni/coli, Salmonella spp., and the indicator of fecal contamination, Escherichia coli, in rinse water used during the slaughtering process at open air food markets in Maputo, Mozambique. We conducted a time-series study at three open air food markets. In a first experiment, we collected paired rinse water (N = 70), water used for chicken processing, and broiler chicken carcass (N = 60) samples from 10 vendors at 75-min intervals starting prior to any processing activity. In a second experiment, we collected 100, 50 mL rinse water samples, immediately before and after processing, from 10 vendors. Chicken processing activity and associated hygiene practices were captured through direct observation. Vendors processed 24 chickens per day, on average. In the first experiment, C. jejuni/coli and E. coli were detected in 30 % and 80 % of rinse water samples, respectively, prior to processing (baseline), and no Salmonella was detected. After the first carcass rinse, C. jejuni/coli and E. coli were detected in 100 % of samples, and Salmonella spp. was detected in 42 % of rinse water samples and 48 % of carcass samples. C. jejuni/coli showed an average 0.1 log<inf>10</inf> copies (95 % CI 0.0, 0.2) increase in rinse water and carcass samples every 75 min. In the second experiment, no C. jejuni/coli or Salmonella spp. were detected in baseline rinse water samples, and E. coli were detected in 78 % of baseline rinse water samples. After processing the first carcass, C. jejuni/coli were detected in 100 % of remaining samples, Salmonella spp. were detected in 28 % of pre-final rinse and 36 % of post-final rinse samples, and E. coli were detected in 81 % of pre-final rinse and 100 % of post-final rinse samples. Our results reveal that consumers are at a high risk of purchasing chicken meat contaminated with human enteropathogens. Once contaminated, rinse water stays contaminated throughout the day. Low-cost and feasible interventions implemented at the carcass wash step are needed to reduce microbial hazards on chicken meat before purchase."

Consequently, there is a pressing need for a rapid and precise method to identify bacterial contaminants in drinking water. The objective of this study was to investigate the protein profiles of various bacterial species present in water through the application of protein fingerprinting (PF) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) techniques, as well as to evaluate their antimicrobial resistance. A total of two hundred water samples were collected from five distinct locations within the Qassim region of Saudi Arabia. The bacterial isolates were identified via the protein fingerprinting analytical technique (PFAT), which was subsequently confirmed via real-time PCR. The Kirby–Bauer method was employed to assess antibiotic resistance among the bacterial isolates. Among the 200 water samples analyzed, PFAT successfully identified 123 bacterial isolates, with the most frequently isolated species being 48 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), 17 Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and 16 Escherichia coli (E. coli). All the waterborne bacterial isolates were accurately identified 100% of the time, achieving a score of 2.00 or higher. The results from real-time PCR indicated that 87.5% of the P. aeruginosa isolates were positive for the oprI gene, all the S. aureus isolates were positive for the nuc gene, and 93.75% of the E. coli isolates were positive for the fliC gene. P. aeruginosa isolates presented a high level of resistance to aztreonam (64.6%), whereas S. aureus presented significant resistance to cefoxitin and cefepime (88.24%), followed by aztreonam (82.35%) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (70.6%). E. coli isolates were completely resistant to ampicillin (100%), with high resistance also observed against amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin (87.5%), and cefepime (81.25%). This study underscores the importance of utilizing PFATs for the microbiological identification of diverse water samples as a reliable and effective method. Furthermore, these findings emphasize the necessity for the regular surveillance and monitoring of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in drinking water sources."

Although numerous studies have investigated the bacteriological quality of drinking water in Ethiopia, their findings have been inconsistent and varied, hindering the implementation of effective water quality monitoring. Moreover, there is a lack of nationwide assessment of the bacteriological quality of drinking water in Ethiopia. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the bacteriological quality of drinking water and its associated factors in Ethiopia. Methods An international electronic database, including PubMed, Science Direct, Global Health, CINAHL, African Journals Online, HINARI, and Google Scholar was employed to retrieve the relevant articles. The study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA) guidelines. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect size, and the Egger regression model was employed using STATA 14 software to assess potential publication bias. Results A total of 26 studies involving 7,962 water samples met the eligibility criteria for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of at least one bacteriological contamination of drinking water was 52.26% (95%CI: 39.09-65.43), with extreme heterogeneity (I2 = 99.7%; p-value < 0.001). The pooled prevalence of total and fecal coliform in drinking water was 49.55% (95% CI: 34.88-64.23) and 44.27% (95%CI: 34.36-54.19), respectively. 14.13% of the water source was at a very high sanitary risk level (unfit for drinking), with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 94.1%, p< 0.001). The absence of household-level water treatment (OR = 3.3; 95%CI: 1.28-5.32) and drawing water using dipping methods (OR = 4.52; 95%CI: 1.71-7.34) were determinant factors for bacteriological contamination of drinking water. Conclusion We found that the bacteriological quality of drinking water did not comply with the World Health Organization and Ethiopia’s standard guidelines for drinking water, which call for urgent intervention. One out of seven water sources was at a high sanitary risk level, which could increase the risk of infectious disease in the country. The absence of household-level water treatment and drawing water using dipping was a significant factor in the bacteriological quality of drinking water. Based on these findings, the water supply and sewerage authority should prioritize regular monitoring of the bacteriological quality of drinking water."

Environmental factors such as geomorphology, land use, human activities, and seasonality could influence pathogen dissemination. This study performed a space-temporal analysis of Escherichia coli concentrations, virulence (eaeA, bfpA, stx2, aatA, and st), and resistance (tetA, blaTEM, blaOXA, Intl-1, Intl-2, sul-1, and sul-2) genes in surface water within the Virilla sub-watershed, Costa Rica. The research employs microbiological, geostatistical, and quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) techniques to evaluate the health risks associated with diarrheagenic E. coli. Samples collected monthly over a year were analyzed for fecal coliforms, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, physicochemical parameters, and the presence of virulence and resistance genes. The geographically weighted regression model identified significant associations between the virulence and resistance genes presence and environmental factors influence such as land use, slope, altitude, and seasonal changes. The results show that urban and grazing land use significantly influence the presence of resistance genes, while human fecal pollution is associated with higher concentrations of virulence genes. Seasonal variations showed that wet seasons contributed to increased gene presence (number of positive samples) and diversity (variety of virulence and resistance genes) compared with dry season. The QMRA results indicated that the total health disease burden was higher than the benchmark for drinking water recommended by WHO (1.00 × 10−6 DALY – Disability-Adjusted Life Years – per person per year) by between one and four magnitudes orders, particularly in regions with urban and grazing land use, human fecal pollution class, and lower altitudes. This study highlights the relevance of integrating environmental and microbial data to enhance water quality management and public health strategies in resource-limited regions. It underscores the need for targeted interventions, such as improved wastewater treatment and establishing buffer zones, to mitigate the risks associated with microbial pollution in surface waters."

Water samples were collected twice for each season (dry and wet) from the 15 sampling locations throughout the study area and transported immediately to the laboratory for analysis. The samples were analyzed according to the standard methods and procedures of APHA (2005). Most of the physicochemical parameter results fell within the limits established by WHO (2011) and NSDWQ (2015), except for dissolved oxygen (DO), chloride, total dissolved solids (TDS), and electrical conductivity (EC). The maximum mean concentrations of pH, phosphate, and sulphate (7.64 ± 0.54, 19.23 ± 4.63 mg/L, and 1.12 ± 0.64 mg/L) were recorded in Danduste ward, while a low turbidity mean value of 2.96 ± 0.31 NTU was observed in Goya ward. The high total coliform and faecal coliform counts were recorded from well water samples in all the wards, while Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, and Salmonella typhi were the bacterial isolates identified during this study. Diarrhoea, typhoid, and dysentery were the most commonly reported waterborne diseases in most primary health centers within this study area. The study revealed that well water sources were located close to pit latrines, averaging 11.4 m, which is below the WHO-recommended safe distance of 30 m. The quality of well water in the Funtua Local Government Area has been compromised due to the proximity of some water sources to pit latrines, rendering the water unsuitable for use without prior treatment."

While carcass washing is primarily done to enhance appearance by getting rid of visible contaminants, when poorly implemented, the intervention has the potential to become a source of contamination by introducing both spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, diminishing beef hygiene. The aim of this study was to investigate the bacteriological and chemical quality of slaughterhouse tap water used in washing beef carcasses in Kajiado slaughterhouses. Previous studies of slaughterhouse water quality in Kenya have not dealt with portable water, major focus being on quality of effluent prior to discharge. Total and faecal coliform, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella spp. in sampled water were examined with cultural methods. Water pH, temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, Iron (Fe), aluminium (Al), fluoride, nitrate, nitrite and ammoniacal nitrogen were determined using several analytical instruments. Three out of five tap water samples (60%) tested positive for E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa while one sample (20%) had isolates confirmed as having Salmonella species. Water sample temperatures ranged between 23.4 and 26.1 ℃which were over the World Health Organization's (WHO) regulatory level of 20 ℃. Forty percent of the samples exceeded Fe guidelines, recording 0.35 ppm (M3) and 0.24 ppm (M1C), with the latter also exceeding in EC (2533 ppm), and TDS (1260 ppm). One spring water (M1A) and one borehole water (M2A) sample had ammoniacal nitrogen and fluoride levels of 0.72 ppm and 2.05 ppm, respectively which were beyond the WHO regulatory limit. Aluminium and nitrate levels were low ranging from 0.027 to 0.059 ppm and 0.42 to 2.24 ppm, respectively. Nitrites were not detected. The study concluded that faecal contamination of water intended for beef hygiene and slaughterhouse sanitation operations raises public health concern for the presence of microbial risks including enteric pathogens and opportunistic infections. The study recommends sensitization of slaughterhouse management and local authority on role of water quality in slaughter operations and the establishment of sustainable water treatment and monitoring plans. Additionally, the study recommends further research to investigate seasonality of water quality and sustainable water treatment methods."

Fifteen samples were collected and analyzed. The mean moisture, ash, fat, protein, salt, and water activity were 81.76%, 0.98%, 1.88%, 14.04%, 0.14%, and 0.9869, respectively. The proximate contents varied slightly among sites but were not significantly different (p > 0.05). The mean aerobic mesophilic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, total coliform, and fecal coliform counts were 6.30 log CFU/g, 2.91 log CFU/g, 1.51 log MPN/g, and 0.89 log MPN/g, respectively. Such high microbial loads and the high counts of fecal coliforms are indicative of poor handling practices and unsanitary processing that might lead to foodborne illnesses and economic losses. In addition, the mean concentration of heavy metals in the tissue samples decreased in the order of chromium (0.165 mg/kg) > arsenic (0.085 mg/kg) > lead (0.054 mg/kg) > cadmium (0.010 mg/kg). Except for chromium, the concentrations of the assessed metals were below the maximum permissible limits. Long-term chromium exposure, especially in its hexavalent form, can pose significant health risks like respiratory issues, gastrointestinal distress, and even cancer. Therefore, identifying contamination sources, employing proper waste management strategies, continuous monitoring of heavy metal levels, and proper fish handling practices are highly recommended to address the health implications of microbial contamination and elevated chromium concentrations."

The MCRPEC prevalence was 2.43 % in WWTPs, 1.37 % in IAW and 0.69 % in LRF. MCRPEC showed substantial genetic diversity, encompassing 61 sequence types (primarily ST1011, ST101, and ST2705), 7 plasmid types (primarily IncI2), 8 phylogroups (primarily A and B1), 9 mcr-1-flanked lineages (primarily L5), 6 clusters (primarily C2 and C4), diverse serotypes, and 61.95 % transposon-containing strains. The mcr-1 gene co-existed with 46 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and 19 virulence factor genes (VFGs). Notably, 6 IncI2 plasmids carried the bla<inf>CTX-M</inf>, IS1380, and mcr-1 genes. MCRPEC from WWTPs harbored a greater number of ARGs (56.95 ± 5.99) but fewer VFGs (15.03 ± 6.40) compared to those from human-associated sources (LRF and IAW). ST1011, ST2705, IncHI2, and L7 were prevalent in WWTP-derived MCRPEC, whereas IncX4 and L3 were more common in human-derived MCRPEC. Genetic features such as ST101, ST48, IncI2, L4, L5, C2, and C4 were simultaneously present in strains from LRF, IAW, and WWTPs. Core genetic analyses also showed genetically similar MCRPEC strains across various geographic locations. The findings underscore the extensive dissemination, strong environmental adaptation, and clonal transmission of MCRPEC across diverse reservoirs, reinforcing the urgent need for coordinated multisectoral surveillance of human and environment interfaces to effectively mitigate further transmission."

Fecal contamination of drinking water threatens public health, particularly in rural communities which are often fully reliant on unregulated private groundwater as a primary drinking water source. Private well users face a higher risk of acute gastrointestinal illness compared to those served by municipally operated systems (Murphy et al., 2016). Accordingly, the current study sought to characterize the fecal indicator, E. coli, isolated from southeastern Ontario private groundwater wells, including phylogroups and host source. Results were examined in the context of antecedent climate and local hydrogeological setting to elucidate likely contaminant sources and pathways. A total of 737 E. coli isolates from 260 private wells were assigned to phylogroups using the Clermont PCR phylotyping method, with likely host source determined using host-specific Bacteroidales 16S rRNA RT qPCR assays. Multivariate models were developed for the main E. coli phylogroups (A, B1, B2, and D) and all microbial source tracking markers. Models were coupled for interpretation where possible, based on associations between phylogroups and MST markers. Preferential subsurface flow, and to a lesser degree, overland flow, were likely mechanisms of contamination across all models. Distinct temporal associations were found based on the fecal source. Multiple models were developed and will be discussed, in an attempt to elucidate source-specific contamination mechanisms, in support of risk assessment and appropriate protective actions."

More than 70% of the samples tested for Total Coliform Count (TCC), Total Faecal Coliform Count (TFC), Total Feacal Streptococci (TFS), and Total Aerobic Count (TAC) were feacal contaminated. E. coli was also isolated in almost 84.61% of the tested piped water samples. Results from the WQI revealed that 95.6% of samples had good physico-chemical characteristics, and 26% of the piped water samples had good microbiological quality. The WQI readings of all the samples for metals showed that they were unfit for human consumption. The mean Chronic Daily Intake (CDI) and Hazard Quotient (HQ) values, respectively, were in the following order: Zn > Fe > Pb > Ni > Cr > As, and Pb > As > Ni > Cr > Zn > Fe. All HQ values for As and Pb were greater than 1, and 50% of piped water samples had an HQ value for Ni that was greater than 1, indicating that people may suffer serious health issues as a result. All of the piped water samples except the area of block 13 D (S-5), had HQ values of less than 1 in relation to iron, but Zn HQ values of less than 1 indicated only mild health problems. Discharge of untreated sewage and cross-contamination are all potential sources of contamination that could result in diseases that are harmful to the public’s health. Water monitoring and management projects should be implemented in order to improve pipeline infrastructure and reduce sewage leakages."
"Antimicrobial activity and nanoremediation of heavy metals using biosynthesized CS/GO/ZnO nanocomposite by Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 alone or immobilized in a macroporous cryogel","M.M., El-Zahed, Mohamed M.; M.I.M., Abou-Dobara, Mohamed Ismail M.; M.M., El-Khodary, Marwa M.; M.M.A., Mousa, Mohamed Mohamed A.","Microbial Cell Factories","10.1186/s12934-024-02535-6","23","1","2024","Background: The world society is still suffering greatly from waterborne infections, with developing countries bearing most of the morbidity and death burden, especially concerning young children. Moreover, microbial resistance is one of the most prevalent global problems that extends the need for self-medication and the healing period, or it may be linked to treatment failure that results in further hospitalization, higher healthcare expenses, and higher mortality rates. Thus, innovative synthesis of new antimicrobial materials is required to preserve the environment and enhance human health. Results: The present study highlighted a simple and cost-effective approach to biosynthesize a chitosan/graphene oxide/zinc oxide nanocomposite (CS/GO/ZnO) alone and immobilized in a macroporous cryogel as a new antimicrobial agent. Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 was used as a safe and efficient bio-nano-factory during biosynthesis. The formation of CS/GO/ZnO was confirmed and characterized using different analyses including ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), selective area diffraction pattern (SADP), Zeta analyses, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). GO combined with ZnO NPs successfully and displayed an adsorption peak at 358 nm. The XRD results showed the crystalline composition of the loaded ZnO NPs on GO sheets. FTIR spectrum confirmed the presence of proteins during the synthesis which act as stabilizing and capping agents. The nanocomposite has a high negative surface charge (-32.8 ± 5.7 mV) which increases its stability. SEM and TEM showing the size of biosynthesized ZnO-NPs was in the range of 40–50 nm. The CS/GO/ZnO alone or immobilized in cryogel revealed good antimicrobial activities against B. cereus ATCC 14,579, Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922, and Candida albicans ATCC 10,231 in a dose-dependent manner. The CS/GO/ZnO cryogel revealed higher antimicrobial activity than GO/ZnO nanocomposite and standard antibiotics (amoxicillin and miconazole) with inhibition zones averages of 24.33 ± 0.12, 15.67 ± 0.03, and 17.5 ± 0.49 mm, respectively. The MIC values of the prepared nanocomposite against B. cereus, E. coli, and C. albicans were 80, 80, and 90 µg/ml compared to standard drugs (90, 120 and 150 µg/ml, respectively). According to the TEM ultrastructure studies of nanocomposite-treated microbes, treated cells had severe deformities and morphological alterations compared to the untreated cells including cell wall distortion, the separation between the cell wall and plasma membrane, vacuoles formation moreover complete cell lyses were also noted. In the cytotoxicity test of CS/GO/ZnO alone and its cryogel, there was a significant reduction (p˂0.05) in cell viability of WI-38 normal lung cell line after the concentration of 209 and 164 µg/ml, respectively. It showed the low toxic effect of the nanocomposite and its cryogel on the WI-38 line which implies its safety. In addition, water treatment with the CS/GO/ZnO cryogel decreased turbidity (0.58 NTU), total coliform (2 CFU/100 ml), fecal coliform (1 CFU/100 ml), fecal Streptococcus (2 CFU/100 ml), and heterotrophic plate counts (53 CFU/1 ml) not only in comparison with the chlorine-treated samples (1.69 NTU, 4 CFU/100 ml, 6 CFU/100 ml, 57 CFU/100 ml, and 140 CFU/1 ml, respectively) but also with the raw water samples (6.9 NTU, 10800 CFU/100 ml, 660 CFU/100 ml, 800 CFU/100 ml, and 4400 CFU/1 ml, respectively). Moreover, cryogel significantly decreased the concentration of different heavy metals, especially cobalt compared to chlorine (0.004 ppm, 0.002 ppm, and 0.001 ppm for raw water, chlorine-treated, and cryogel-treated groups, respectively) which helped in the reduction of their toxic effects. Conclusion: This study provides an effective, promising, safe, and alternative nanocomposite to treat different human and animal pathogenic microbes that might be used in different environmental, industrial, and medical applications."

Methods: A total of 42 water samples were collected using sterile glass bottles from three different river sites: Damota (upstream), Kera (midstream), and Gututo (downstream). All the water samples were examined for the presence of heterotrophic bacteria, total coliform and fecal coliform using direct plate count method and membrane filtration method. Standard methods suggested by American water works association were used to analysis the physicochemical parameters of the water samples. Results: The results revealed that the total heterotrophic bacteria, total coliform, and fecal coliform count ranged from 8.9 to 12.6 × 104 cfu/ml, 7.5–11.3 × 102 cfu/ml and 5.7–9.7 × 104 cfu/ml, respectively. The bacterial count results indicated that the river water crossed the WHO-recommended limit of potable water. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, and Shigella species were the common bacterial pathogens isolated from river water samples. The results of the physicochemical analysis revealed that some of the parameters Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and turbidity exceeded the maximum permissible limits of WHO and other parameters were below the WHO permissible limits. Conclusion: Therefore, the presence of bacterial pathogens, fecal coliform indicators, and some physicochemical parameters of the Kalte River exceeding the recommended limits may expose users of the river water to the risk of infection."
"Assessment of groundwater quality for human consumption and its health risks in the Middle Magdalena Valley, Colombia","B., Lora-Ariza, Boris; A., Piña, Adriana; L.D., Donado, Leonardo David","Scientific Reports","10.1038/s41598-024-61259-0","14","1","2024","Groundwater is the primary source of water for people living in rural areas, especially during seasons when surface water is contaminated or unavailable. In Colombia, people use groundwater as drinking water without additional treatment. In addition, there is no infrastructure for wastewater collection and sewage treatment in the region of the Middle Magdalena Valley. The current study aims to evaluate the quality of groundwater in this region to determine any potential health hazards associated with its consumption. To reach the objective, three (3) physicochemical and microbiological sampling campaigns were carried out during different hydrological periods. A total of 428 groundwater samples were analyzed for over 28 parameters. The results were compared with the water quality standards proposed by the US EPA and Colombian regulations for human consumption. The analysis revealed the presence of total and fecal coliforms in 89% and 58% of the analyzed samples, respectively, identifying them as the main contaminants in groundwater. Furthermore, the pH levels did not meet the standards set by the US EPA in 33.8% of the cases and by Colombian regulations in 31.02%. Additionally, 32.8%, 17.6%, 14.3%, and 10.9% of the samples failed to meet the established thresholds for apparent color, magnesium, iron, and nitrates, respectively, under both standards. Moreover, only the analyses of selenium, mercury, and zinc complied with the quality standards under both regulatory frameworks. Based on the Colombian Drinking-Water Quality Risk Index (CDWQRI-IRCA), the risk associated with water quality meant for human consumption was assessed. The results showed that over 84% of the samples analyzed posed a high risk to human health, 4.6% posed a medium risk, 5.5% posed a low risk, and only 5.7% posed no risk at all. Additionally, official mortality statistics for children under four years old were reviewed, which revealed two deaths in 2019 due to Acute Diarrheal Disease (ADD) caused by consumption of contaminated water. Therefore, it is crucial to implement water treatment systems, establish aqueducts in rural areas, and conduct rigorous and systematic monitoring of drinking water to ensure it is safe for human consumption. It is also important to track morbidity and mortality rates associated with water consumption."
"Isolation and characterization of lytic bacteriophages from various sources in Addis Ababa against antimicrobial-resistant diarrheagenic Escherichia coli strains and evaluation of their therapeutic potential","T.S., Sada, Tamirat Salile; T.S., Sisay Tessema, Tesfaye Sisay","BMC Infectious Diseases","10.1186/s12879-024-09152-z","24","1","2024","Background: Escherichia coli is a common fecal coliform, facultative aerobic, gram-negative bacterium. Pathogenic strains of such microbes have evolved to cause diarrhea, urinary tract infections, and septicemias. The emergence of antibiotic resistance urged the identification of an alternative strategy. The use of lytic bacteriophages against the control of pathogenic E. coli in clinics and different environmental setups (waste and drink water management) has become an alternative therapy to antibiotic therapy. Thus, this study aimed to isolate and characterize lytic bacteriophage from various sources in Addis Ababa, tested them against antimicrobial-resistant diarrheagenic E. coli strains and evaluated their therapeutic potential under in vitro conditions. Methods: A total of 14 samples were processed against six different diarrheagenic E. coli strains. The conventional culture and plaque analysis agar overlay method was used to recover lytic bacteriophage isolates. The phage isolates were characterized to determine their lytic effect, growth characteristics, host range activity, and stability under different temperature and pH conditions. Phage isolates were identified by scanning electron microscope (SEM), and molecular techniques (PCR). Results: In total, 17 phages were recovered from 84 tested plates. Of the 17 phage isolates, 11 (65%) were Myoviridae-like phages, and 6 (35%) phage isolates were Podoviridae and Siphoviridae by morphology and PCR identification. Based on the host range test, growth characteristics, and stability test 7 potent phages were selected. These phages demonstrated better growth characteristics, including short latent periods, highest burst sizes, and wider host ranges, as well as thermal stability and the ability to survive in a wide range of pH levels. Conclusions: The promising effect of the phages isolated in this study against AMR pathogenic E. coli has raised the possibility of their use in the future treatment of E. coli infections."

Earlier studies have shown a substantial reduction in the incidence of diarrheal disease over a period of one year using a polysulfone membrane water gravity-powered water filtration device. The current report is a continuation of these studies to assess the long-term effects of the innovative method on diarrheal incidence rates over a 4-year follow-up period. This follow-up study monitored the trend of self-reported diarrheal events in all households in the previously studied villages for 5 months, in the last half of each study year, using the same questionnaire utilized in the earlier study. Three villages that had no device yet installed served as controls. We computed monthly diarrheal incidence rates for all study years (standardized to per 100 person-months) and compared these to the pre-device incidence rate in 2018 and in the control group, using the Wilcoxon rank sum exact test. The average diarrheal incidence rates of 1.5 p100pm in 2019, 2.19 p100pm in 2021, and 0.54p100pm in 2022 were significantly different from an earlier study that reported 17.8 p100pm rates before the devices were installed in 2018, (all p-values < 0.05). Concomitantly, self-reported diarrheal infections were substantially higher in the “control villages” not yet having the filtration device installed (80.9, 77.6, and 21.5 per 100 pm). The consistent and large reduction in diarrhea incidence documents the long-term efficacy of the use of the membrane filtration device. This simple water purification method using gravity flow improves public health in remote regions with limited resources."

However, with the emergence of large-scale epidemic diseases such as SARS, avian influenza and COVID-19 in recent years, people are increasingly concerned about the public health safety of reclaimed water discharged into landscape water, especially the pathogenic microorganisms in it. In this study, the water quality and microorganisms of the Old Summer Palace, a landscape water body with reclaimed water as the only replenishment water source, were tracked through long-term dynamic monitoring. And the health risks of indicator microorganisms were analyzed using Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA). It was found that the concentration of indicator microorganisms Enterococcus (ENT), Escherichia coli (EC) and Fecal coliform (FC) generally showed an upward trend along the direction of water flow and increased by more than 0.6 log at the end of the flow. The concentrations of indicator microorganisms were higher in summer and autumn than those in spring. And there was a positive correlation between the concentration of indicator microorganisms and COD. Further research suggested that increased concentration of indicator microorganisms also led to increased health risks, which were more than 30% higher in other areas of the park than the water inlet area and required special attention. In addition, (water) surface operation exposure pathway had much higher health risks than other pathways and people in related occupations were advised to take precautions to reduce the risks."

We propose and present evidence that these findings result from natural biogeochemical variation between physiographic regions (p < 0.001). These findings suggest that physiographic stream type may influence the degree of exposure to waterborne pathogens and risk of waterborne disease. Future research is needed to assess whether the inclusion of stream type in risk assessments can improve public health modeling and mapping."

The analyses of sand samples have recently been developed as a complement to the monitoring of recreational waters in beach quality assessments. The growing use of molecular techniques for environmental monitoring allows for the rapid detection of pathogenic genes, thus providing more accurate information regarding the health risk of exposure to contaminated sand. The aim of this work was to determine the relationship between the fecal indicators abundance in water and sand and the presence of Shiga toxin-producer Escherichia coli (STEC) in sand by analyzing samples from touristic beaches using culture-dependent (fecal coliforms assay) and culture-independent (real-time PCR of stx1, stx2, and eae genes) techniques. We found a high concentration of coliform bacteria in water and sand in several beaches in eastern Uruguay, with different levels of sanitation networks and levels of urbanization. The presence of STEC virulence genes (mainly stx1) was confirmed in 8 out of 20 sand samples. The recreational use of sandy beaches may imply a risk to the health of its users, especially near streams and creek outflows, thus highlighting the need of monitoring sand bacteriological quality and pathogens using molecular tools."

This study aimed to optimize a prediction model for estimating COVID-19 infection rates based on SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater, and reveal the infection trends and variant diversification in Shenzhen, China following the lifting of a strict COVID-19 strategy. Faecal samples (n = 4337) from 1204 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals hospitalized in a designated hospital were analysed to obtain Omicron variant-specific faecal shedding dynamics. Wastewater samples from 6 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and 9 pump stations, covering 3.55 million people, were monitored for SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations and variant abundance. We found that the viral load in wastewater increased rapidly in December 2022 in the two districts, demonstrating a sharp peak in COVID-19 infections in late-December 2022, mainly caused by Omicron subvariants BA.5.2.48 and BF.7.14. The prediction model, based on the mass balance between total viral load in wastewater and individual faecal viral shedding, revealed a surge in the cumulative infection rate from <0.1 % to over 70 % within three weeks after the strict COVID-19 strategy was lifted. Additionally, 39 cryptic SARS-CoV-2 variants were identified in wastewater, in addition to those detected through clinical surveillance. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of WBE in providing comprehensive and efficient assessments of COVID-19 infection rates and identifying cryptic variants, highlighting its potential for monitoring emerging pathogens with faecal shedding."

Pathogenic strains of E. coli pose a significant public health risk. Despite China's rapid economic and social development, sanitation and watershed management still face challenges. In this study, we employ a combined model of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool and Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment to predict pollution changes, considering social development and climate change. Our aim is to quantify the risks and assess pollution prevention strategies for E. coli in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region. The results indicated that under moderate development, the average E. coli concentrations and disease burdens were 367 ± 75 CFU/100 mL and 23.4 (95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 2.8–72.6) Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs, per 1,000,000 population per year), respectively. Under rapid development, these values were 330 ± 58 CFU/100 mL and 21.2 (95 % CI: 2.6–65.1) DALYs, respectively. Implementing a point strategy, mainly increasing sewage collection rates, could reduce E. coli concentrations by approximately 30 % and disease burdens by 27–28 %. For a diffuse strategy, primarily extending composting duration, reductions of 9 % in E. coli concentrations and 7–8 % in disease burdens were observed. Combining both strategies resulted in a 40 % decrease in E. coli concentrations and 35–36 % reduction in disease burdens. This model, incorporating social development, climate change, and microbial risk, provides insights into predicting pollution changes and evaluating the effectiveness of prevention strategies for E. coli in the TGR region and similar watersheds."

We compared the use of Bacteroides-based exposure assessment to exposure assessment that relied on pathogen measurements. We considered two types of recreational water sites: those impacted by combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and those not impacted by CSOs. Samples from CSO-impacted and non-CSO-impacted urban creeks were analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for HF183 Bacteroides and eight human gastrointestinal pathogens. Exposure assessment was conducted two ways for each type of site (CSO-impacted vs. non-CSO impacted): 1) by estimating pathogen concentrations from HF183 Bacteroides concentrations using published ratios of HF183 to pathogens in sewage and 2) by estimating pathogen concentrations from qPCR measurements. QMRA (quantitative microbial risk assessment) was then conducted for swimming, wading, and fishing exposures. Overall, mean risk estimates varied from 0.27 to 53 illnesses per 1,000 recreators depending on exposure assessment, site, activity, and norovirus dose-response model. HF183-based exposure assessment identified CSO-impacted sites as higher risk, and the recommended HF183 risk-based threshold of 525 genomic copies per 100 mL was generally protective of public health at the CSO-impacted sites but was not as protective at the non-CSO-impacted sites. In the context of our urban watershed, HF183-based exposure assessment over- and under-estimated risk relative to exposure assessment based on pathogen measurements, and the etiology of predicted pathogen-specific illnesses differed significantly. Across all sites, the HF183 model overestimated risk for norovirus, adenovirus, and Campylobacter jejuni, and it underestimated risk for E. coli and Cryptosporidium. To our knowledge, this study is the first to directly compare health risk estimates using HF183 and empirical pathogen measurements from the same waterways. Our work highlights the importance of site-specific hazard identification and exposure assessment to decide whether HF183 is applicable for monitoring risk."

In investigated SWSSs, the mean heterotrophic plate counts were below 350 CFU/mL, and the total bacterial loads (16S rDNA concentration) ranged from 4.71 to 5.35 log<inf>10</inf> copies/mL. The results also showed the consistent presence of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), i.e., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens, suggesting the potential of fecal pollution. E. coli was then utilized as an indicator to assess the health risk posed by E. coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter jejuni. The results indicated that the estimated mean annual risk of infection and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) exceeded acceptable levels in all SWSSs for the two reference pathogens. To ensure microbial water safety, implementing appropriate water treatment facilities with an estimated mean required reduction of 5–6 log<inf>10</inf> was necessary. This study highlighted the potential microbial contamination and health risk level in SWSSs that utilize mountain streams as water sources, even though the water sources were almost not affected by human activities. Furthermore, this study would also be helpful in supporting risk-based water management to ensure a safe water supply in SWSSs."

The total viability, coliform, fecal coliform count, and heavy metal in muscle partially decreased at HGS 10 and HGS15 mL−1 than in the control group. Correspondingly, the highest positive effect on hemato-biochemical indices was noticed at levels HGS 10 and HGS15 mL−1. Fish noticed an improvement in immune and antioxidant indices compared to control groups partially at HGS 10 and HGS15 mL−1. Interestingly, fish cultured in rearing water with the mixture provided downregulated the related inflammatory genes (HSP70, TNF, IL-1β, and IL-8) partially at HGS15 mL−1. In vitro, the mixture showed positive efficiency as an antibacterial and partially antiparasitic at HGS 10 and HGS15 mL−1. This study proposes utilizing a mixture of (HGS) and (MgO-NPs) with optimum levels of 10–15 mL-1 in cultured water to improve water indices, growth, health status, and increased resistance of O. niloticus against bacterial and parasitic infection."
"The risk of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) enterococci and antibiotic resistance transmission during simulated municipal sludge composting","B., Zhang, Bingni; Y., Fu, Yulong; F., Wang, Feiyu; P., Jin, Pingri; P., Xu, Pengcheng; H., Li, Haoming; X., Xu, Xiaojie; C., Shen, Chaofeng","Waste Management","10.1016/j.wasman.2024.04.048","183",NA,"2024","Sludge composting is a sludge resource utilization method that can reduce pollutants, such as pathogens. Enterococci are regarded as more reliable and conservative indicators of pathogen inactivation than fecal coliforms, which are typically used as indicators of fecal pollution. Non-spore pathogenic bacteria may enter a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state during composting, leading to residual risk. The VBNC status of bacteria is related to their survival during composting. However, the survival mechanisms of enterococci during sludge composting remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the VBNC state of enterococci in different phases of simulated sludge composting and the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) during the composting process. This study is expected to provide a basis for subsequent exploration of possible methods to completely inactivate enterococci and reduce ARGs during sludge composting. Culturable enterococci were reduced in the thermophilic phase of sludge composting, but the proportion of VBNC subpopulation increased. It was reported for the first time that most VBNC enterococci were killed by extending the cooling phase of sludge compost, and by prolonging the cooling phase the types of ARG were reduced. However, there was a certain quantity (approximately 104/g dry weight) of culturable and VBNC enterococci in the compost products. In addition, MGEs and ARGs exist in both bacteria and compost products, leading to the risk of spreading antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance when sludge compost products are used."

This study critically evaluates the interlinkage between bacteriological water quality, i.e. faecal coliforms and diarrhoea cases for the three pre-pandemic years 2017, 2018 and 2019 based on multiple sources. With around 17% of households tap water connectivity as of August 2019, the majority of the Indian population depends on raw groundwater (GW) and surface water sources. For this, faecal coliform (FC) levels in surface and GW have been mapped at district levels using data from India’s National Water Quality Monitoring Programme. Health Management Information System’s data on diarrhoea have been used to understand the monthly and district-wise variation of diarrhoea. The trends of FC, diarrhoea inpatient cases, and diarrhoea inpatient rates have been discussed. The analysis showed issues associated with the reliability and usefulness of these datasets with 43% of total India districts with no reported FC values for the study period. This study reveals a clear gap in the interlinkage between diarrhoea and bacteriological water quality with the unavailability of granular water quality data as a major challenge."

Herein, the distribution and spread risk of pathogen were assessed in excavated landfill scenario. The results show that landfill excavation will greatly increase the risk of environmental microbial contamination. The highest total concentration of culturable bacteria among landfill refuse, topsoil and plant leaves was found to be as high as 1010 CFU g−1. Total coliforms, Hemolytic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Enterococci, and Fecal coliforms were detected in the landfill surrounding environment. Notably, pathogens were more likely to adhere to plant leaves, making it an important source of secondary pathogens. The culturable bacteria concentration in the air samples differed with the landfill zone with different operation status, and the highest culturable bacteria concentration was found in the excavated area of the landfill (3.3 × 104 CFU m−3), which was the main source of bioaerosol release. The distribution of bioaerosols in the downwind outside of the landfill showed a tendency of increasing and then decreasing, and the highest concentration of bioaerosols outside of the landfill (6.56 × 104 CFU m−3) was significantly higher than that in the excavated area of the landfill. The risk of respiratory inhalation was the main pathway leading to infection, whereas the HQ<inf>in</inf> (population inhalation hazardous quotient) at 500 m downwind the excavation landfill was still higher than 1, indicating that the neighboring residents were exposed to airborne microbial pollutants.

Although municipal wastewater plants are important sources and sinks for potential pathogenic microorganisms, data on rural wastewater treatment processes are limited. The proximity of rural wastewater facilities to human settlements and the trend toward wastewater resourcing could pose risks to humans. Here, a typical village in southern China was selected to analyze potential pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater, sewage sludge, and aerosols during the collection, treatment, and discharge of domestic wastewater. The succession characteristics and concentration variations of potential pathogenic microorganisms throughout the wastewater treatment process were identified using high-throughput sequencing and culture methods. Bacteria-associated health risks in facility aerosols were estimated based on average daily dose rates from inhalation and dermal exposure. Lower amounts of pathogenic bacteria and pathogenic fungi were detected in the effluent of the 1-ton treatment scale and the 10-ton treatment scale facilities, compared to those in the influent. Pathogen effluent concentrations were significantly lower than influent concentrations after treatment in rural wastewater facilities. 16 and 29 potential pathogenic bacteria and fungi were detected in aerosols from wastewater treatment facilities, respectively. Furthermore, the potential pathogen concentrations were higher than those in the background air. Aerobic units are the main source of pathogen emissions from aerosols. There were 42 potential pathogenic bacteria and 34 potential pathogenic fungi in the sewage sludge. Biochemical units were the main source of potential pathogens in sewage sludge, and more potential airborne pathogens originated from wastewater. In rural wastewater resourcing processes with greater pollutant exposure, the effluent of rural wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs), downstream rivers, and facility aerosols, could be important potential sources of microbial risk. Inhalation is the main pathway of human exposure to airborne bacteria. Therefore, more attention should be focused on microbiological risk in rural wastewater treatment processes."

The efficacy of routinely assayed water quality parameters was assessed as an alternative or complement to fecal nucleic acid viral indicator data for their utility in adjusting measured SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations to improve the relationship between wastewater molecular data and clinical COVID-19 case data. This research covers two study designs: grab samples collected from sewers serving The Ohio State University campus and composite influent samples collected at five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across the state of Ohio. Weekly mandatory clinical testing was used to monitor infections in the student population, and statewide cases were reported through voluntary clinical testing. Statewide WWTP results showed significant strong correlation between SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in the wastewater and confirmed COVID-19 cases, and correlation increased when normalized by flow and additionally increased when normalized by pH, total suspended solids, and temperature, but correlation decreased when normalized by a nucleic acid fecal viral indicator (PMMoV). On campus, correlations were generally not significant unless normalized by PMMoV and/or UV absorbance parameters. Because water quality parameters are routinely assayed at wastewater treatment plants and some may be collected by autosamplers, incorporating wastewater quality data may improve WBE models and could minimize molecular and cellular testing for fecal indicators to decrease costs."

This study presents the COVID-19 lockdown impact on the spatio-temporal evolution of surface water quality according to 5-year monitoring (2015–2021) using the global quality assessment system SEQ-Eau including the collection of water samples, some lab analysis, and the visualization of results through GIS tools. The same results were compiled statistically using the ANOVA approach in order to compare the spatio-temporal alterations. The evaluation of the quality of surface waters of four sites selected on the course of the Wadi Fez, and crossing mainly the district of Dokkarat, revealed that the organic and bacteriological pollution, before containment, exceeds the quality standards of surface waters and classifies these waters as being of poor quality. In addition, the concentration of fecal coliforms is very high, with a maximum value exceeding 100,000 CFU 100 mL−1, especially downstream from Wadi Fez. Moreover, the sites close to the Dokkarat district are characterized by very high pollution. The results obtained by the bivariate ANOVA test and their statistical validation show that the time factor influences most of the studied alterations. However, after 2020, the quality of the physicochemistry and bacteriology watercourse has considerably improved. Over 5 years (2015–2020), the data comparison shows an average increase in physicochemical quality of 31% and increasing bacteriological quality of 16%. This period is before and after the COVID-19 confinement. The reopening of industrial units as well as the acceleration of anthropic activities can explain the substantial impact they generate. Indeed, this study highlights the impact of the human activity on the quality of superficial water flowing along Oued Fez. It suggests a direct link between periods of industrial sustainability with high rates of pollution and in contrast, and it relates the improvement of water quality to the deceleration of those activities. Otherwise, decision-makers can rely on its results to locate the sources and the nature of pollution and anticipate these environmental patterns in the case of a future similar pandemic.

This work demonstrates the development of a biocompatible, cost-effective, highly robust, efficient, flexible, freestanding, and reusable membrane using naturally formed biocompatible kaolinite clay-doped poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) for effective piezodynamic destruction of coliform bacteria. In this study, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) have been used to evaluate the mechanical stimulus-responsive antibacterial efficacy of the nanocomposite membrane. The membrane can effectively eradicate nearly 99% viable E. coli and 97% E. faecalis within a span of 40 min under mechanical stimulation (soft ultrasound ∼15 kHz). To further understand the mechanism, an evaluation of reactive oxygen species and bacterial FESEM was performed. These studies revealed that bacterial cells suffered severe visible cell damage after 40 min of piezocatalysis, elucidating the fact that the synthesized membrane is capable of producing a superior piezodynamic antibacterial effect."

Results showed that both community-supply and self-supply modes exhibit similar levels of risk. However, the self-supply water source consistently showed higher risks compared to the community-supply one. Borehole water was found to be a more suitable option than well water, consistently showing between 5 and 8 lower health risks for E. coli and fecal coliform levels, respectively. The sensitivity analysis further showed the importance of prioritizing the reduction of E. coli concentration in well water and fecal coliform concentration in borehole water.

The cholera outbreaks in 2016/2017 triggered emergency WASH interventions to improve water quality and reduce cholera and other water-borne disease incidence. Aim: This study aimed to assess the microbial water quality in Sana’a, Yemen, following cessation of the WASH activities. Methods: We collected and analysed water samples in 2022 from 64 out of the 381 mini water purification plants that benefitted from WASH interventions in Sana’a in 2018, 2019 and 2020.Face-to-face interviews with representatives of each mini water purification plant were conducted alongside observatory evaluations. We compared results of the 2022 analyses with those of 2018, 2019 and 2020. We analysed our data using Microsoft Excel 2010 and descriptive statistics and presented the results in tables and charts. Results: By 2022, one year after suspending the WASH interventions, the purification system rating had decreased slightly from 87.4% to 84.1%, and the water safety requirements rating had decreased significantly from 78.1% to 62.1%, compared to the 2018–2020 values. This caused a nearly double value, from 15.1% to 31.3%, for the microbial pollution, confirming an inverse relationship between microbial pollution and both purification system and water safety requirements. Conclusion: The microbial water quality of the plants was degraded due to the cessation of the WASH programme. It is important to consider sustainability issues when designing and implementing WASH programmes to ensure that they achieve their goals. It is also crucial to monitor WASH activities rigorously and invest in raising awareness of WASH benefits among operators and community members so they can become effective partners in preventing contamination and water pollution."

Faecal bacterial richness and diversity were higher in gulls feeding upon landfills and showed a greater abundance of potential pathogens, such as Staphylococcus. In contrast, faecal bacterial communities from storks were similar regardless of habitat preferences, maybe due to a less intense habitat use compared to gulls. In addition, birds feeding in the landfill carried a higher burden of ARGs compared to the surrounding soil and surface waters. Network analysis revealed strong correlations between ARGs and potential pathogens, particularly between tetM (resistance to tetracyclines), bla<inf>CMY</inf> (beta-lactam resistance), sul1 (sulfonamide resistance) and members of the genera Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, and Peptoclostridium.

Here, for the first time, we have examined the differential effects of drinking water regimens stratified by chlorination agent [inorganic (HOCl) versus chloramine (TCIC)] on the C57BL/6J murine fecal microbiota. To this end, we exposed C57BL/6J mice to chlorinated drinking water regimens followed by fecal bacterial microbiota analysis at the end of the three-week feeding period employing 16S rRNA sequencing. α-diversity was strongly reduced when comparing chlorinated versus control drinking water groups and community dissimilarities (β-diversity) were significant between groups even when comparing HOCl and TCIC. We detected significant differences in fecal bacterial composition as a function of drinking water chlorination observable at the phylum and genus levels.

Risks of HAV infection was estimated using dose-response model, and probabilities of clinical illness and mortality were also determined. Results: Results revealed that the levels E. coli and faecal coliforms were greater during the wet period than the dry period (p< 0.05). Concentration of HAV was greater during the dry period than the wet period (p< 0.05). Risks of HAV infection were higher during the dry period than the wet period, and were all above the US EPA acceptable risk limit. Risk of clinical illness and mortality due to HAV were higher during the dry period than the wet period. Conclusions: Ingestion of water from the river may result into liver inflammation, morbidity or death. Development of active water management plans to reduce pollutant fluxes and address contamination threats must be established."

In this study, the microbiomes of water samples collected from managed watersheds in Singapore were elicited using the PhyloChip, a dense 16S rRNA gene-based DNA microarray, and fecal impairment was inferred using a machine-learning classification algorithm (SourceTracker). The predicted contribution of wildlife fecal sources to environmental samples was generally negligible (< 0.01 ± 0.01), indicating a low likelihood of fecal impairment from natural sources. However, sewage showed considerably higher contribution (0.09 ± 0.05) to microbial communities in a subset of watershed samples from canals and rivers, suggesting persistent impairment of certain areas by anthropogenic activity although being managed. Interestingly, the contribution of sewage microbial communities showed decreasing trends from canals/rivers to the connected reservoirs, indicating meaningful auto-mitigation of fecal pollution in canals and rivers. Notably, exclusion of locally derived fecal samples and source categories from the training data set impaired the predictive performance of the classification algorithm despite a high degree of similarity in the phylogenetic composition of microbiomes in biologically similar but geographically distinct sources."

Because testing for each pathogenic organism is very expensive and time consuming, coliform bacteria and E. coli from environmental and animal sources serve as good pathogen indicator organisms. This study focused on the evaluation of water quality in microbiologically purified waste from the tap and Hovsan coastal areas of the Caspian Sea via gamma-ray monitoring. Radiation technology allows for the possibility of combined water purification, including chemical and biological treatment; therefore, this technology is more suitable for water disposal. Before irradiation, the concentrations of total microbes (at 22°C and 37°C), E. coli, heterotrophic bacteria and total coliform bacteria were monitored. The samples were then irradiated with different doses of gamma radiation. In this context, the application of gamma radiation for the microbiological treatment of wastewater, domestic tap water and water from the Hovsan coastal area of the Caspian Sea, which can be applied to minimize the effect on the human body, was investigated."

However, concerns about antibiotic resistance have led to the search for alternatives like probiotics. This study evaluates the outcome of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 (BA) administration on intestinal health profile, measured through histological structure examination (using scanning electron microscope) and fecal coliform and Escherichia coli enumeration, as well as overall health performance (growth-related parameters and ND genotype-7 virus antibody titers). A total of 90 one-day-old Cobb broilers were randomly assigned to three groups. The control group, G1, did not get any BA supplementation. The treatment group G2 was administered BA through their drinking water at a dose of 50 g/1,000 liters of water for 30 days. Finally, the treatment group G3 received BA at the same concentration but only on days 1-7, 13-17, and 23-27. Morphological parameters of the small intestine, health performance, and fecal microbial populations were measured on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. Antibody titers were sampled on day 30. On day 28, the villi height and width of the jejunum were significantly increased in G3 compared to those in G1 and G2. Over the experiment period, broilers in both treatment groups had higher (p<0.05) body weight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG) than the control group. Furthermore, G3 had significantly lower feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to birds in G2 and G1. Both treatment groups had lower coliform and E. coli populations in their fecal samples than the control group. The measured antibody levels were also significantly higher in the two BA groups compared to the control, indicating better protection. In conclusion, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens has the potential to replace AGPs in broiler production with better results when administered at specific times."
"Probabilistic human health risk assessment of commercially supplied jar water in Gopalganj municipal area, Bangladesh","P.P., Brahma, Partha Pratim; S., Akter, Sharmin; M.M., Haque, Md Morshedul; M.A., Khirul, Md Akhte","Frontiers in Water","10.3389/frwa.2024.1441313","6",NA,"2024","Every day, the amount of quality fresh water decreases notably due to contamination of drinking water. As a result, people use commercially supplied jar water in the southern part of Bangladesh as well as in the Gopalganj municipal area. This study aims to investigate the physicochemical parameters, trace elements, and microbial parameters for assessing human health risks from oral ingestion of these elements. This study gathered commercially supplied jar water samples from 15 companies in the Gopalganj municipal area during the post-monsoon season. Temperature, potential of hydrogen (pH), total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), and salinity showed significant variation among the samples, and the level was within the national and international standard limits. The concentrations of iron (Fe) and arsenic (As) were measured using a UV–VIS spectrophotometer and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), respectively. The microbial analysis was conducted by the membrane filtration method. The study found that the water samples had an average concentration of 0.16 mg/L in terms of Fe and 0.016 mg/L in terms of As, with the mean value of As exceeding the standard limits. On the other hand, the mean Fe concentration value did not exceed the standards. Probable human health risk from heavy metal in the jar water was determined by hazard quotient (HQ), hazard index (HI), and carcinogenic risk (CR) assessments. A child (HI = 3.5914) is more vulnerable to non-carcinogenic human health risks than an adult (HI = 1.6931). Furthermore, pollution in water samples was found to pose a high carcinogenic risk, with children (CR = 1.6 × 10−3) being more vulnerable to carcinogenic risk than adults (CR = 7.5 × 10−4). In the microbial analysis, 100% of the samples exceeded the total coliform and fecal coliform standard limits, and 80% of the samples exceeded the Escherichia coli standard limits. Among the samples, 7% present high risk, around 47% present medium risk, 26% show low risk, and 20% show no risk based on the E. coli standard limits. This study did not find any samples that exceeded the extremely high limit for E. coli concentration. This study found that drinking jar water samples had inadequate quality, which may increase the risk of water-borne infections such diarrhea as well as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. As a result, the manufacturer of drinking water in jars must carry out the essential quality control procedures, and the government should regularly monitor the procedures."

The research was carried out to observe the effect of M. oleifera on the microbial load of Raw Water (RW) and treated water (TW) sourced from the Ibn Ziad wastewater treatment facility in Constantine. Results of bacteriological analyses show that the raw water is heavily polluted with high levels of the targeted bacteria: 4.4 × 109 CFU/ml in total germs, 2.4 × 104 CFU/100 ml in total coliforms and total streptococci, and 1.1 × 104 CFU/100ml in fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and fecal streptococci, with no decrease observed for sulfite-reducing clostridia. However, the water treated with M. oleifera, at a dose of 20 g·L-1, demonstrates a significant reduction of 99% in total germs, 96% in total coliforms, and 98% in fecal coliforms, with a complete absence of Escherichia coli, streptococci, as well as a complete elimination of total sulfite-reducing clostridia, which falls with the standard guidelines for using this water in irrigation. The obtained results confirmed that M. oleifera seeds positively impact the reduction of pathogenic microorganisms found in wastewater."

The methodological approach includes the analysis of health data of typhoid and the evaluation of the microbial quality of water and vegetables produced in smallholdings irrigated with wastewater selected from different sampling sites in the urban area and peri-urban area of Meknes. The results revealed that from 2008 to 2019, there were 879 confirmed typhoid cases with an average annual incidence of 11.07 and a peak in 2010, particularly affecting the age group 5 to 14 years (43.46%). The number of typhoid cases was higher in males compared to females, with no significant difference (p > 0.05). Bacteriological analysis of water samples indicates significant fecal contamination, not conforming to irrigation standards. The analysis of vegetables reveals a high level of fecal coliforms and the presence of Salmonella, without significant differences between the sampling sites (p > 0.05), representing a risk factor of infection for consumers. The spatial analysis highlights a correlation between typhoid incidence and the distribution of areas irrigated with wastewater. This further highlights the potential role of wastewater irrigation in typhoid transmission, pointing out the need to improve water management."

In 2014, the Wilder Institute/Calgary Zoo initiated North America's only zoo-based conservation breeding program for this species to bolster declining wild populations through conservation reintroductions. Within the managed population of sage-grouse, morbidity and mortality have primarily been associated with intestinal bacterial infections. As a preliminary study to assess the gastrointestinal health of this species in managed care, the fecal bacterial microbiome of adult and juvenile captive sage-grouse was characterized with 16S rRNA sequencing. The composition of the microbiome at the phylum level in greater sage-grouse is consistent with previous studies of the avian microbiome, with Bacillota as the most abundant phyla, and Actinomycetota, Bacteroidota and Pseudomonadota also being highly abundant. Antibiotic use and sex did not have a significant impact on the diversity or composition of the microbiome, but the management of juvenile sage-grouse did influence the development of the microbiome. Juveniles that were raised outdoors under maternal care developed a microbiome much more similar to adults when compared to chicks that were incubated and hand-raised. The local environment and parental care appear to be important factors influencing the diversity and composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome in this species."

Using data from the Centre for Pollution Control Board of India and the Indian Human Development Survey (IHDS) 2011-12, we study the effect of water quality in the Ganges Basin on the performance in three test scores. Our evidence suggests that faecal coliform levels in water sources above safety thresholds negatively affect reading and writing test scores. The effects of Nitrate-N and Nitrite-N in the water appear to be weaker compared to those of faecal coliform. The results establish that water pollution caused by excessive presence of faecal coliform is an important environmental factor in determining educational outcomes of children. High levels of faecal coliform in the water could be lowering cognitive abilities of the pollution-affected children through the channel of waterborne diseases."

Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are monitored to assess recreational waters but may not reflect the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, a global leader in bacterial fatalities. Since many community-acquired S. aureus skin infections are associated with high recreational water usage, this study measured and modeled S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and FIB (Enterococcus spp., Clostridium perfringens) concentrations in seawater and sand at six beaches in Hilo, Hawai‘i, USA, over 37 sample dates from July 2016 to February 2019 using culturing techniques. Generalized linear models predicted bacterial concentrations with physicochemical and environmental data. Beach visitors were also surveyed on their preferred activities. S. aureus and FIB concentrations were roughly 6–78 times higher at beaches with freshwater discharge than at those without. Seawater concentrations of Enterococcus spp. were positively associated with MRSA but not S. aureus. Elevated S. aureus was associated with lower tidal heights, higher freshwater discharge, onsite sewage disposal system density, and turbidity. Regular monitoring of beaches with freshwater input, utilizing real-time water quality measurements with robust modeling techniques, and raising awareness among recreational water users may mitigate exposure to S. aureus, MRSA, and FIB. Practitioner Points: Staphylococcus aureus and fecal bacteria concentrations were higher in seawater and sand at beaches with freshwater discharge. In seawater, Enterococcus spp. positively correlated with MRSA, but not S. aureus. Freshwater discharge, OSDS density, water turbidity, and tides significantly predicted bacterial concentrations in seawater and sand. Predictive bacterial models based upon physicochemical and environmental data developed in this study are readily available for user-friendly application."

This study evaluates the ground water quality for drinking purpose in terms of 10 hydro-geochemical and two biological parameters in context of causative factors like land use and geology of the region. The occurrence of water borne diseases in resident population has been examined in association with quality of drinking water and priority areas for policy intervention have been identified. Water samples have been collected from 173 drinking water sources and 346 households consuming water from the selected sources have been surveyed for prevalence of water borne diseases. Water quality surfaces have been mapped in terms of F, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Hardness, Fe, alkalinity, Faecal Coliform (FC), E. Coli, and Water Quality Index (WQI) computed on the basis of 10 geochemical parameters, using Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) method. Results reveal that the north-eastern part comprising Aspur, Sabla and part of Sagwara tehsils predominantly has ‘very poor’ to ‘unsuitable’ water quality. The western part has excessive faecal contamination. Entire district has high levels of TDS and hardness, while excessive Fe and F occur in specific regions. Disease incidence closely corresponds to the geochemical and microbial composition of water. Higher values of WQI correspond with occurrence of Phyllites and Mica Schists."

In this paper, we argue for the inclusion of Vibrio spp. abundance as a supplemental indicator of water quality for science-based coastal management by examining the environmental and bacterial indicators at a fish farm and a control site in Mali Ston Bay in the Adriatic Sea. Unexpectedly, heterotrophic bacteria, enterococci and Vibrio spp. were more abundant in the cold season, while E. coli and total coliforms, following a more traditional pattern, were more abundant in the warm season. Each of the currently used indicators has a specific purpose: heterotrophic bacteria indicate the presence of both nonpathogenic and pathogenic bacteria, while enterococci are pathogenic bacteria indicating fecal pollution. Vibrio spp. abundance additionally represents a non-fecal bacteria that can cause vibriosis in humans and aquatic organisms. Since vibriosis is the leading cause of disease-related fish mortality in aquaculture, pathogenic Vibrio spp. have large health and economic implications. These implications, as well as the added interpretative value when compared to other bacterial indicators, make Vibrio spp. abundance a good candidate as a water quality indicator. Significant dependence of the abundance on depth further differentiates Vibrio spp. from other indicators, thus bolstering the candidacy - especially in aquaculture areas. Before inclusion of any Vibrio spp. indicators into legislature, further research is needed particularly into (i) abundance thresholds characterizing water quality, and (ii) identification of species whose abundance should be monitored for best estimate of the disease risks."

Hence, the present study has been introduced to assess the impact of the COVID-19 LKD coupled with seasonal variations (SVs) on the water quality status of the Hindon River (HR), Ghaziabad (GZB). The report includes secondary data analysis of different water quality parameters (WQPs), viz., dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), fecal coliform (FC), and total coliform (TC). BOD and DO are the preliminary indicators of organic load, and analysis of FC and TC determines the overall pathogen load in water bodies. The effect of seasonal variations, i.e., pre-monsoon (PRM), monsoon (MS), and post-monsoon (POM) at sampling locations designated by the monitoring body at HR (GZB stretch), viz., Mohan Nagar road bridge (MNRB), Karheda village (KV), and Chijarsi bridge (CB) was investigated for 2019 to 2021. DO level was comparatively higher during 2020 at sampling stations (SLSs) MNRB and KV. BOD reductions were ~17–40% during the LKD phase at SLSs KV and CB compared to PRD and PLD. The SVs significantly influence the DO and BOD at all the SLSs. The water samples during the PRM of 2020 showed lower BOD levels compared to 2019 and 2021 at all the SLSs. FC/TC ratio was highest at the LKD phase at all the SLSs. The coliform load was greater at SLS CB than at MNRB and KV. A strong positive correlation was obtained between TC-BOD and FC-BOD at the LKD phase during all the SVs. Based on the WQPs analysis, CB was found to be the most contaminated sampling location. Despite higher coliform loads, the LKD phase experienced overall improvements in DO and BOD levels."

The accurate quantification of such risks is crucial in managing beaches effectively and establishing warning guidelines. In this study, we employed a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) framework to assess marine water quality and estimate the risks associated with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, an autochthonous pathogen that causes gastrointestinal illnesses, and enterococci, a traditional fecal bacteria indicator. The microbial contamination levels of V. parahaemolyticus and enterococci were determined from 48 water samples collected at two beaches in Thailand during dry and wet seasons. The accidentally ingested water volumes were obtained through a survey involving 438 respondents. The probability of illness (P<inf>ill</inf>) was estimated using dose–response models and Monte Carlo simulation. The results revealed that enterococci posed a higher risk of illness than V. parahaemolyticus at all seven study sites. The median combined gastrointestinal (GI) risk from both bacteria at all sites met the US EPA risk benchmark of 0.036 and the 0.05 benchmark set by the WHO, but the 95th percentile risk data at all sites exceeded the benchmarks. This emphasizes the need for the continuous monitoring and management of microbial pollution at these sites. The site-specific exposure data showed higher estimated risks with increased variations compared to the WHO-referenced values, which highlights the significance of locally measured microbial concentrations and survey exposure data to avoid underestimation. Estimating the risks from recreational exposure to waterborne bacteria can inform beach management policies aimed at reducing public health risks to swimmers. The study findings improve the understanding of the risks associated with water recreation activities at Southeast Asian beaches and offer valuable insights for the development of water quality guidelines, which are crucial for the sustainable development of the blue economy."

Administering bacteriophages (phages) is under evaluation as a possible intervention strategy in primary poultry production to reduce the public health risk of human infection. A major challenge is the translation of results from small-scale animal studies to large broiler flocks. In this study, the in vitro lytic activity of 18 Campylobacter-specific group II phages and 19 group III phages were examined singly, and in different combinations from the same group and from both groups using a planktonic killing assay. Based on these results, a combination of phage NCTC 12,673 (group III) and vB_CcM-LmqsCPL1/1 (group II) was selected for in vivo application in a seeder bird model to study its effectiveness under conditions as close as possible to field conditions. One hundred eighty Ross 308 broiler chickens were divided into a control and a treatment group. Ten days post hatch, seeder birds were orally inoculated with the C. jejuni target strain. Phages were administered via drinking water at a total concentration of 107 PFU/mL four, three, and two days before necropsy. Results: Combining group II and group III phages resulted in significantly higher in vitro growth inhibition against the C. jejuni target strain BfR-CA-14,430 than single application or combinations of phages from the same group. The results of the animal trial showed that the application of the two phages significantly reduced Campylobacter counts in cloacal swabs. At necropsy, Campylobacter counts in colonic content of the treatment group were significantly reduced by 2 log<inf>10</inf> units compared to the control group. Conclusions: We demonstrated that combining phages of groups II and III results in significantly increased lytic activities. The in vitro results were successfully translated into practical application in a study design close to field conditions, providing new data to apply phages in conventional broiler flocks in the future. Phage application reduced the fecal Campylobacter excretion and Campylobacter concentrations in the colon of broilers."

Moreover, parasitic infection (PI) was noticed in 73.1% of the collected water samples; mainly Cyclospra and Isospora (37.2% each), followed by Cryptosporidium spp., Giradia lamblia, Microsporidia spp., and Blastocystis spp. (34.6%, 21.8%, 15.4%, and 14.1%, respectively). Acanthameba spp. was detected but at a lower rate (5.1%). The frequency of cleaning the swimming pools, flow rate, Cl<inf>2</inf>, and total dissolved solids are significantly affected PI, independently. Conclusion: The tested water samples don’t meet Egyptian bacteriological criteria. High parasitic contamination despite high residual chlorine level mainly intestinal coccidia, G. lamblia, microsporidia, and Blastocystis spp. Thus, monitoring pool’s water quality and improving the disinfection system are mandatory. Consequently, Health education regarding hygienic behaviors before and during swimming should be included in governmental programs."
"Footprints of total coliforms, faecal coliforms and E. coli in a wastewater treatment plant and the probabilistic assessment and reduction of E. coli infection risks","S., Chen, Sisi; J., Chen, Jiangfeng; X., Wang, Xiankai; J., Li, Ji; B., Dong, Bin; Z., Xu, Zuxin","Science of the Total Environment","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165845","900",NA,"2023","Wastewater contains various pathogenic microorganisms, and the disease of workers caused by exposure to wastewater at the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is a growing concern. The footprints of total coliforms (TC), faecal coliforms (FC) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in a conventional activated sludge WWTP during 12 consecutive months were clarified. It was found that TC, FC and E.coli in influent were significantly removed (log 4.71, log 4.43 and log 4.62, respectively) by WWTP with sand filtration playing a key role, and excess sludge was a major potential pathway for them flowing to the environment. Through quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), hand-to-mouth ingestion of untreated wastewater and wastewater in secondary/efficient sedimentation tanks, as well as accidental ingestion of sludge in dewatering workshop presented the highest infection risks of pathogenic E.coli in the WWTP, considerably exceeded the U.S. EPA benchmark (≤1 × 10−4 pppy). PPE application and E.coli concentration reduction in wastewater or sludge were recommended to reduce the infection risks at these stages. Further, partial ozonation and dissolved ozone flotation thickening were investigated able to reduce the infection risks at the stages of secondary and tertiary treatment of wastewater or sludge treatment by 90– 98 %. The findings of this study would assist in selecting appropriate processes for the further sanitation of WWTPs."
"Assessment of multiple fecal contamination sources in surface waters using environmental mitochondrial DNA metabarcoding","R., Ragot, Rose; F., Lessard, Florence; A., Bélanger, André; R., Villemur, Richard","Science of the Total Environment","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165237","898",NA,"2023","Waterborne diseases are transmitted to humans through the fecal contamination of water, where homeothermic species are the main reservoir. Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are often used to determine the occurrence of fecal contamination. However, FIB cannot provide the source of fecal contamination. Furthermore, as fecal inputs and contamination could originate from multiple sources (e.g., human, livestock, wildlife), multiple source tracking markers are required to identify fecal sources. From a previous study, we developed a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) metabarcoding approach to assess the presence of multiple homeotherms in four surface waters. Here, we have broadened our approach by sampling 86 surface water samples from the L'Assomption River and Ville-Marie watersheds (Province of Quebec, Canada). Fecal coliform levels were higher than the expected sanitary recommendations for recreational water (> 200 CFU/100 mL) in 73 % samples. The occurrence of mtDNA from human, livestock, domestic animals, wild mammals and wild birds was found in 40–88 % of the samples. Multivariate analyses showed significant covariations between homeothermic taxa and fecal coliforms, enterococci, β-D-glucuronidase, conductivity, the human-specific Bacteroidales Hf183 genetic marker, and the human population, in the watersheds of L'Assomption River (p = 0.001) and Ville-Marie (p = 0.015) (Province of Quebec, Canada). Through the application of Bayes Theorem, it was determined that fecal coliforms co-occurred with the detection of bovine, beaver, robin and chicken mtDNA in 100 % of cases in the L'Assomption River watershed, and human mtDNA co-occurred with fecal coliforms in 93 % and 76 % of cases in L'Assomption River watershed and Ville-Marie sub-catchment, respectively. This study suggests that fecal contamination could be the result of multiple species, among which some wild animals may contribute to fecal inputs in surface waters, resulting in potential risk to human health. This reinforces the necessity of using the mtDNA metabarcoding method to monitor multi-animal species."

However, many countries, including Ethiopia, do not have adequate data to report on basic water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services. Although contaminated drinking water spreads diseases like cholera, diarrhea, typhoid, and dysentery, studies on drinking water contamination risk levels in households are limited in Ethiopia. Therefore, closing this gap needs investigation. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 5350 households were included. A systematic, simple random sampling technique was used to select the participants. The information was gathered through in-person interviews using a standardized questionnaire. Furthermore, 1070 drinking water samples were collected from household water storage. Results: This investigation revealed that 9.8%, 83.9%, and 4.9% of households used limited, basic, and safely managed drinking water services, respectively. Besides, 10.2%, 15.7% and 59.3% of households used safely managed, basic and limited sanitation services, respectively. Yet, 10.6% and 4.2% of households used unimproved sanitation facilities and open defecation practices. Also, 40.5% and 19.4% of households used limited and basic hygiene services. On the other hand, 40.1% of households lacked functional handwashing facilities. In this study, 12.1%, 26.3%, and 42% of households’ drinking water samples were positive for Escherichia coli, fecal coliforms, and total coliforms, respectively. Also, 5.1% and 4.5% of households’ drinking water samples had very high and high contamination risk levels for E. coli, respectively. We found that 2.5% and 11.5% of households and water distributors had unacceptable fluoride concentrations, respectively. Conclusion: The majority of households in Bishoftu town lack access to safely managed sanitation, drinking water, and basic hygiene services. Many households’ water samples had very high and high health risk levels. Hence, the government and partner organizations should implement water and sanitation safety plans."

The unexpected beach closures during the COVID-19 lockdowns have afforded unique opportunities to evaluate the impact of human activities on bathing water quality (BWQ). This study examined the temporal changes in fecal coliforms (FC) and streptococci (FS) within bathing seawater across a popular coastal region in Morocco during two lockdown periods (2020 L and 2021 L), comparing these data with observations from pre-lockdown years (2018, 2019) and post-lockdown periods (2020, 2021, 2022). Our findings illuminate the influential role the hiatus periods played in enhancing bathing water quality, attaining an “excellent” status with marked reductions in fecal coliform and streptococci levels. Consequently, the FC/FS analysis exposed a clear preponderance of humans as the primary sources of fecal contamination, a trend that aligns with the burgeoning coastal tourism and the escalating numbers of beach visitors. Additionally, the presence of domestic animals like camels and horses used for tourist rides, coupled with an increase in wild animals such as dogs during the lockdown periods, compounded the potential sources of fecal bacteria in the study area. Furthermore, occasional sewage discharge from tourist accommodations and wastewater treatment plants may also contribute to fecal contamination. To effectively mitigate these concerns and bolster public health, a commitment to relentless surveillance efforts, leveraging novel and innovative tools, is essential. These findings underline the crucial interplay between human activities and the health of our coastal ecosystems, emphasizing the need for sustainable practices for a safer and healthier future."

To this end, we collected data at both regional (water quality measures from water treatment systems) and community (cross-sectional surveys) scales to examine determinants of enteric pathogen infection and diarrheal disease among infants in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Regionally, the Legedadi water treatment plant had significantly lower heterotrophic plate counts, total coliform counts, and fecal coliform counts compared with the Gefersa water treatment plant. The number of pathogen types in infant stool also differed by plant. Decreases in chlorine levels and increases in the relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria with distance from treatment plants suggest a compromised water distribution system. In communities, infants in households that obtained water from yard pipes or public taps had significantly lower odds of diarrhea compared to households that had water piped into their dwellings (OR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.16, 0.76, and OR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.15, 1.00, respectively). Similarly, infants in households that boiled or filtered water had significantly lower odds of diarrhea compared to households that did not treat water (OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.19, 0.86 and OR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.06, 0.84, respectively).

The faecal pathogen transmission pathway is complex with several possible routes. Latrine front-end characteristics and usage behaviours are one key transmission pathway for microbial pathogens, however, there has not yet been a synthesis of the available research. This review aims to compare the microbial infection risks with latrine front-end components including any quantified microbial densities within the household latrines. This review was conducted with no restriction on the geographical location of the research. Of 118 studies reviewed, only ten (8%) have quantified the microbial density inside the household latrines compared to 109 (92%) measuring the infection risks. The reported risks were most frequent for specific bacterial (n = 34), and helminths infections (n = 32) compared to diarrhoea (n = 23), combined (n = 15), protozoan (n = 4), and viral (n = 4) infections. The infections risk decreased for using latrines lying at a higher position on the sanitation ladder (for example flush latrines) compared to those lying lower (for example pit latrines). The trend was similar for using floor materials that were easier to clean and less favourable for pathogen survival inside the latrines (for example, concrete as opposed to earth). Faecal coliforms were reported highest on the surface of the squat pan (743 CFU/cm2) of pour-flush latrines and helminths on earth floors of pit latrines (1.5 eggs and larvae per gram of soil). Irrespective of latrine type and its position on the sanitation ladder, a dirty latrine, evidenced by a visible lack of cleanliness, significantly increased the risk for all infections. This study recommends that effective microbial infection risk reduction in latrines can be gained efficiently by ensuring washable surfaces and consistent cleaning practices. Future studies should include more rigorous measurements of microbial densities in various latrine types incorporating the different front-end components and usage behaviours."

Until 2014, ISO 9308-1:2000 was available and used to enumerate faecal indicator Escherichia coli in bathing water. In 2014, this ISO was technically revised and replaced by ISO 9308-1:2014. This ISO introduced a less selective method for enumeration of E. coli that allows non-specific growth from waters containing high levels of bacteria, such as surface waters. This implies that currently there is no suitable reference membrane filtration method for the compliance monitoring of official bathing sites for E. coli according to the European Bathing Water Directive. Here, the performance characteristics of three chromogenic culture media, namely Tryptone Bile X-glucuronide (TBX) agar, Chromogenic Coliform Agar (CCA), and CHROMagar E. coli/Coliform (ECC) were investigated at 44 °C for water with varying levels of bacteria according to ISO 13843:2017. Based on performance characteristics, colony counts, and practical usage, TBX appeared the most suitable culture medium for the enumeration of E. coli in bathing water and other waters with high levels of background bacteria, such as surface water in agricultural areas and wastewater discharge points."

To address this knowledge gap, we developed an innovative monitoring approach for quantitative assessment of combined sewer overflow (CSO) impacts on the bacteriology of receiving rivers. Our approach combines conventional and environmental DNA (eDNA) based methods to generate multiple lines of evidence for assessing risks to public health. We demonstrated this approach by investigating spatiotemporal variation in the bacteriology of the Ouseburn in northeast England for different weather conditions in the summer and early autumn of the year 2021 across eight sampling locations that comprised rural, urban, and recreational land use settings. We characterized pollution source attributes by collecting sewage from treatment works and CSO discharge at the peak of a storm event. CSO discharge was characterized by log<inf>10</inf> values per 100 mL (average ± stdev) of 5.12 ± 0.03 and 4.90 ± 0.03 for faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci, and 6.00 ± 0.11 and 7.78 ± 0.04 for rodA and HF183 genetic markers, for E. coli and human host associated Bacteroides, respectively, indicating about 5 % sewage content. SourceTracker analysis of sequencing data attributed 72–77 % of bacteria in the downstream section of the river during a storm event to CSO discharge sources, versus only 4–6 % to rural upstream sources. Data from sixteen summer sampling events in a public park exceeded various guideline values for recreational water quality. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) predicted a median and 95th percentile risk of 0.03 and 0.39, respectively, of contracting a bacterial gastrointestinal disease when wading and splashing around in the Ouseburn. We show clearly why microbial water quality should be monitored where rivers flow through public parks, irrespective of their bathing water designation."

Drinking water quality in Pakistan is decreasing gradually due to alarming population growth, rapid industrialization, climate change and lack of efficient water quality management. In Pakistan, the majority of the population doesn’t have access to safe and healthy drinking water sources, and people are forced to use unsafe drinking water. This review compiled data from multiple studies published in international and national journals from 2010 to 2022 and reports issued by the governments and non-governmental institutions to highlight Pakistan’s drinking water quality status, and to emphasize major water pollutants, sources of contaminants, and significant health problems. The results revealed that bacteriological contamination such as coliforms (total coliform, fecal coliform, Escherichia coli), toxic elements like arsenic (As), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), chloride (Cl−), fluoride (F−), mercury (Hg) and pesticides were found in both surface water and groundwater, and were the major causes of waterborne diseases. The majority of sampled water had bacteriological, physicochemical and toxic metals concentrations exceeding the National Standards for Drinking Water Quality (NSDWQ) and WHO drinking water quality standards. There is an immediate need to adopt water management strategies and protective measures to overcome the shortages and unhygienic conditions of the drinking water supply in Pakistan."

However, this criterion has two significant limitations given that the BWD does not; (i) account for differences in hydrodynamic properties of bathing waters and, (ii) assumes that all faecal pathogens decay equally in aquatic environments. This study simulated sewage discharge events in three hypothetical aquatic environments characterised by different advection and dispersion parameters in the solute transport equation. Temporal changes in the downstream concentration of six faecal indicators were determined in simulations that utilised measured decay rates of each faecal indicator from a programme of controlled microcosm experiments in fresh and seawater environments. The results showed that the decay rates of faecal indicators are not a critical parameter in advection dominant water bodies, such as in fast-flowing rivers. Therefore, faecal indicator selection is less important in such systems and for these, FIB remains the most cost-effective faecal indicator to monitor the public health impacts of faecal contamination. In contrast, consideration of faecal indicator decay is important when assessing dispersion and advection/dispersion dominant systems, which would pertain to transitional (estuarine) and coastal waterbodies. Results suggest that the inclusion of viral indicators, such as crAssphage and PMMoV, could improve the reliability of water quality modelling and minimise the risk of waterborne illnesses from faecal contamination."

In laboratory studies, growth of HPB and other bacterial species is affected by physical and chemical attributes, but natural communities of HPB are not well understood. To determine how in situ environmental and water quality variables may affect density of HPB in the natural aquatic environment, we compared presence and abundance of HPB to ambient temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, fecal coliforms, male-specific coliphage, nutrient concentrations, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios, and C:N in water samples collected from July 2017 to February 2018 along a natural salinity gradient in a tidal river on the coast of northern Gulf of Mexico. HPB in water samples were quantified using a real-time PCR, most probable number method. HPB species were identified via 16S rRNA gene sequences. Temperature and salinity were determined to be the main factors driving HPB presence and concentration. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that different HPB were associated with different environmental conditions. Photobacterium damselae was found under warmer, higher-salinity conditions; Raoultella planticola was found at colder, lower-salinity conditions; Enterobacter aerogenes was found at warmer, lower-salinity conditions; and Morganella morganii was found at most sites, independent of environmental conditions. These results showed that naturally occurring HPB abundance and species composition can be affected by environmental conditions, which could manifest in various potentials for histamine formation and scombrotoxin fish poisoning risk based on environmental factors."

Surface and groundwater were the major sources of drinking water in these cities. The physicochemical parameters were total turbidity, pH, dissolved solids (TDS), sulphates, chlorides, calcium, sodium, HCO<inf>3</inf>, potassium, magnesium, nitrates, fluorides, arsenic, and hardness. The bacteriological parameters were total coliform, total faecal coliform, and total plate counts. The data revealed that pH, TDS, fluoride, chloride, HCO<inf>3</inf>, sodium, and hardness were above the limits in Karachi. MCB Market, Goth Ibrahim, and Malir Town were the main contaminated areas in Karachi. In Lahore, arsenic was found above the limits in all sampling locations. Turbidity, pH, HCO<inf>3</inf>, calcium, magnesium, and hardness were found above the limits in Peshawar. In Gilgit city, all physicochemical parameters were found within the limits except turbidity, which was 10 NTU in Nomal valley. Nitrates were higher in the water sources in Abbottabad. Bacterial contamination was found in the water of all five cities. Most of the studies revealed that this contamination could be human-induced. The improper disposal of solid waste, sewage, and animal waste and the excessive use of fertilisers deteriorate the quality of the water. Precipitation, a rise in temperature, and seasonal variation are climate variables that affect water quality and are responsible for major outbreaks of waterborne diseases. There is an urgent need for regular analysis, proper management, and proper treatment of drinking water before it is supplied to the local community in these cities."

E. coli was about 42.67% (n = 102), followed by Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica 20.92% (n = 50), Staphylococcus aureus 13.38% (n = 32), Pseudomonas spp. 12.55% (n = 30), and Klebsiella spp. 10.46% (n = 25) amongst the total of 239 isolates. The seasonal impact and the dependency of the occurrence of bacteria on one another were determined to be insignificant in the Spearman correlation test. These results showed that external factors (anthropogenic activities) are mainly responsible for the presence of these bacteria in water resources. The occurrence of bacterial isolates has been noticed in all water samples, irrespective of collecting site or season."

The groundwater contamination documented for the shallow aquifer generates contamination of the deep unconfined type aquifer, from which part of the population’s drinking water needs are met. This study records incipient anthropogenic contamination of two types: biogenic and potentially toxic trace elements. The studied contaminants include fecal coliform bacteria, total coliform, nitrate, and potentially toxic elements such as: manganese ((Formula presented.)), mercury ((Formula presented.)), arsenic ((Formula presented.)), and cadmium ((Formula presented.)). This contamination in some locations exceeds the permissible limit for human consumption. Some major consequences to health, including severe illness, may be caused by the trace elements. The present results give a first signal about the contamination of the deep unconfined type aquifer due to anthropogenic activity in the valley. This is a priority issue because this aquifer supplies drinking water, and in the short or medium term it will have an effect on public health."

Further, chronic diarrhea puts children at risk for mineral deficiencies, malnutrition, and stunting which, in turn, can result in cognitive deficits, poor performance in school, and decreased disease immunity in adulthood. Most diarrhea is caused by water contaminated by fecal matter. Interventions to improve clean water and sanitation can save lives; however, challenges persist in informal settlements. In this study, we explored the views of residents of informal settlements regarding water and sanitation in their communities. Focus group interviews were conducted with residents of 6 informal settlements in Kampala, Uganda (n = 165 people), and 6 key informant interviews were conducted with governmental and nongovernmental organizations that work to improve informal settlements or provide services to them. The results from this study demonstrate that, although these informal settlements had many infrastructure “upgrades” such as latrines and toilets, water taps, wells, and garbage collection and drainage systems, the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) system and its components largely failed due to point-of-use charges of water taps and toilets and the difficulty of emptying cesspits. Our results suggest that WASH must be considered a system and that multiple upgrading efforts are needed for WASH systems to work, including road construction and better oversight of fecal sludge disposal."

In this study, we aimed to assess this microbiological threat to fish in an Algerian northwestern dam Sekkak (Tlemcen) by evaluating the diversity of ichtyopathogenic bacteria. In order to determine the water quality, physicochemical analyses of the dam water were carried out in situ. Ichtyopathogenic bacteria were isolated on selective media and identified by API galleries and molecular techniques (PCR and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene). Besides, the antibiograms were constructed for all the isolates. The physicochemical and bacteriological analyses allowed us to classify the dam water as moderately polluted to polluted. Furthermore, an important diversity of ichtyopathogenic bacterial species was observed as Aeromonas hydrophila, Providencia rettgeri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were retrieved. The antibiogram test revealed notable resistance. The antibiotic family for which most resistances were found was the β-lactam family, followed by aminoglycosides and macrolides. These results indicate that aquatic environments can shelter multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria representing a threat to the endemic fauna. Therefore, it is important to closely monitor these waters in order to improve the fish's living environment and ensure healthier production."
"Nowcasting of fecal coliform presence using an artificial neural network","A., Pras, Asaf; H., Mamane, Hadas","Environmental Pollution","10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121484","326",NA,"2023","At least 2 billion people worldwide use drinking water sources that are contaminated with feces, causing waterborne diseases; poor sanitation, poor hygiene, and unsafe drinking water result in a daily death rate of more than 800 children under 5 years of age from diarrheal diseases. This study shows the feasibility of a novel method to nowcast fecal coliforms' (FC) presence in drinking water sources by applying a multilayer perceptron artificial neuron network (MLP-ANN) model. The model gives a binary answer for FC presence or absence in drinking water sources using a minimum of water quality and geographical parameters, which can be monitored in real-time as predictors with low-cost and in-situ equipment. Using 51,400 samples to train, validate and test the model with temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and total dissolved solids (TDS) as water-quality inputs and the water source type and location (as districts in India) as geographical inputs. The model achieved a total accuracy of 92.8% and a sensitivity of 98.2%, meaning that most FC-contaminated samples were classified correctly. In addition, precision reached 93.1%, meaning that most FC-contamination classifications were actually contaminated. The MLP-ANN performed better than the Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors models, with lower accuracies of 90.2% and 91.0%, respectively. The MLP-ANN model could characterize the water quality geospatially, learn from the parameters whether the water is contaminated by FC, and predict with high accuracy on new testing data. This method can be used as a part of a sensor for FC monitoring and management in water, reducing the time gaps between routine lab testing and thus improving drinking water quality and addressing the SDG 6 targets."

The sewage water was subjected to ten AOPs, which include Ozone (O<inf>3</inf>), Hydrodynamic cavitation (HC), Ultraviolet radiation (UV), and their hybrid combinations like HC/O<inf>3</inf>, HC/O<inf>3</inf>/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, HC/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, O<inf>3</inf>/UV, UV/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, UV/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>/O<inf>3</inf>, and O<inf>3</inf>/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Further, AOP treated sewage water was subjected to total nucleic acid isolation followed by RT-qPCR for viral load estimation. The sewage water treatment techniques were evaluated based on their viral concentration-reducing efficiency. It was found that ozone and ozone-coupled hybrid AOPs showed the most promising result with more than 98 % SARS-CoV-2 viral load reducing efficiency from sewage water. Interestingly, the best six AOPs used in this study significantly reduced both the SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV (faecal indicator) viral load and improved water quality in terms of increasing DO and decreasing TOC."

In addition, E. coli and total coliform exceeding the threshold standards are found in 47% and 64% of the water samples, respectively. The contamination of DW by fecal coliforms is confirmed and supported by prior studies, which indicates that the DW supplied in restaurants and tea stalls are unsafe because of the possible presence of pathogens. These may cause potential health hazards to consumers from various water-borne diseases. Poor sanitation, unhygienic practices, and improper disposal of wastewater are responsible for the microbial contamination of DW. So, the authorities in charge of these places should take the right regulatory steps, such as regular sanitation inspections, DW quality monitoring, hand-washing practices, and better sanitation in these places."

However, estimating opioid use and exposure in a large population is almost impossible, and alternative methods are being explored, including wastewater-based epidemiology. Wastewater contains various contaminants that can be monitored to track pathogens, infectious diseases, viruses, opioids, and more. This commentary is focusing on two issues: use of opioid residue data in wastewater as an alternative method for opioid exposure assessment in the community, and the adoption of a streamlined approach that can be utilized by public health officials. Opioid metabolites travel through the sanitary sewer through urine, fecal matter, and improper disposal of opioids to local wastewater treatment plants. Public health officials and researchers within various entities have utilized numerous approaches to reduce the impacts associated with opioid use. National wastewater monitoring programs and wastewater-based epidemiology are approaches that have been utilized globally by researchers and public health officials to combat the opioid epidemic. Currently, public health officials and policy makers within Metro Atlanta are exploring different solutions to reduce opioid use and opioid-related deaths throughout the community. In this commentary, we are proposing a new innovative approach for monitoring opioid use and analyzing trends by utilizing wastewater-based epidemiologic methods, which may help public health officials worldwide manage the opioid epidemic in a large metro area in the future."

Therefore, it is important to have regular quality control monitoring. This study aimed to assess the level of physicochemical and bacteriological quality of household drinking water and its contributing factors in flood-prone settlements of South Gondar Zone, Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in flood-prone settings of Northwest Ethiopia from January 17 to March 30, 2021. Structured questionnaires were used to gather the sociodemographic, environmental, and behavioral data. A total of 675 drinking water samples were collected from water storage containers of selected households. Logistic regression models were used for both univariate and multivariable studies. The survey included a total of 675 households. The mean values of pH (5.9 ± 1.03), turbidity (6.7 ± 2.21 NTU), and free residual chlorine (0.02 ± 0.01 mg/l) did not meet the WHO recommended limits for drinking water. The prevalence of fecal contamination of drinking water in the study area was 62.2% with [95% CI (53–60%)]. Family size [AOR = 2.205, 95% CI (1.375–3.536), absence of latrine [AOR = 3.449, 95% CI (1.349–8.823)], and lack of a separate container to draw water from its storage [AOR = 0.454, 95% CI (0.249–0.827)] were significant predictors for fecal contamination of household drinking water. In conclusion, the water quality in terms of pH, turbidity, residual chlorine, and bacteriological parameters was poor and not suitable for consumption. High prevalence of fecal contamination of water was found, and it was significantly associated with family size, the absence of a latrine, and the lack of a separate cap to take water from the storage. Therefore, continuous chlorination and monitoring its concentration, educating the community on how to use stored water, educating the advantage of having a latrine, and promoting point-of-use treatments such as filtration and boiling are needed."

We conducted a hospital-based study to explore wastewater management in healthcare facilities and analyzed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the hospital wastewater in Dhaka city during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak between September 2020–January 2021. We selected three COVID-hospitals, two non-COVID-hospitals, and one non-COVID-hospital with COVID wards, conducted spot-checks of the sanitation systems (i.e., toilets, drainage, and septic-tank), and collected 90 untreated wastewater effluent samples (68 from COVID and 22 from non-COVID hospitals). E. coli was detected using a membrane filtration technique and reported as colony forming unit (CFU). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using the iTaq Universal Probes One-Step kit for RT-qPCR amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab and N gene targets and quantified for SARS-CoV-2 genome equivalent copies (GEC) per mL of sample. None of the six hospitals had a primary wastewater treatment facility; two COVID hospitals had functional septic tanks, and the rest of the hospitals had either broken onsite systems or no containment of wastewater. Overall, 100 % of wastewater samples were positive with a high concentration of E. coli (mean = 7.0 log<inf>10</inf> CFU/100 mL). Overall, 67 % (60/90) samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The highest SARS-CoV-2 concentrations (median: 141 GEC/mL; range: 13–18,214) were detected in wastewater from COVID-hospitals, and in non-COVID-hospitals, the median SARS-CoV-2 concentration was 108 GEC/mL (range: 30–1829). Our results indicate that high concentrations of E. coli and SARS-CoV-2 were discharged through the hospital wastewater (both COVID and non-COVID) without treatment into the ambient water bodies. Although there is no evidence for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via wastewater, this study highlights the significant risk posed by wastewater from health care facilities in Dhaka for the many other diseases that are spread via faecal oral route. Hospitals in low-income settings could function as sentinel sites to monitor outbreaks through wastewater-based epidemiological surveillance systems. Hospitals should aim to adopt the appropriate wastewater treatment technologies to reduce the discharge of pathogens into the environment and mitigate environmental exposures."

The objective of this study was to assess the utility of 24-hour composites as representative samples for measuring multiple microbiological targets in wastewater, and whether normalization of SARS-CoV-2 by endogenous targets can be used to decrease hour to hour variability at different watershed scales. Two sets of experiments were conducted, in tandem with the same wastewater, with samples collected at the building, cluster, and community sewershed scales. The first set of experiments focused on evaluating degradation of microbiological targets: SARS-CoV-2, Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) – a surrogate spiked into the wastewater, plus human waste indicators of Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV), Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), and fecal coliform bacteria (FC). The second focused on the variability of these targets from samples, collected each hour on the hour. Results show that SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV, and B2M were relatively stable, with minimal degradation over 24-h. SIV, which was spiked-in prior to analysis, degraded significantly and FC increased significantly over the course of 24 h, emphasizing the possibility for decay and growth within wastewater. Hour-to-hour variability of the source wastewater was large between each hour of sampling relative to the variability of the SARS-CoV-2 levels calculated between sewershed scales; thus, differences in SARS-CoV-2 hourly variability were not statistically significant between sewershed scales. Results further provided that the quantified representativeness of 24-h composite samples (i.e., statistical equivalency compared against hourly collected grabs) was dependent upon the molecular target measured. Overall, improvements made by normalization were minimal within this study. Degradation and multiplication for other targets should be evaluated when deciding upon whether to collect composite or grab samples in future studies."

Six bacterial genera: Staphyloccocus, Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Shigella were isolated. The mean temperature of the water ranged from 26.0 ± 0.3o C to 27.0 ± 0.1o C. The highest mean dissolved oxygen, total hardness, sulphate and magnesium was 24.0 ± 1.0, 40.1 ± 0.8, 11.0± 1.0, and 67.0 ± 1.5 (mg L-1), respectively. The results showed that ≥ 66.7 S. aureus were Levofloxacin and Streptomycin sensitive; between 45.5 and 68.1% of the isolates were Gentamycin and Chloramphenicol resistant, while 81.8% exhibited multidrug resistance. Escherichia coli EcSW3, E. aerogenes EeWW2, K. pneumoniae KpSW3, and S. aureus SaSW had their entire ARMs located on the plasmids with the molecular sizes ˂ 2.027 Kbp. This study showed that the stream and well water harboured bacteria with some ARMs on plasmids, indicating the possibility of horizontal transfer of antibiotic-resistant genes among the bacteria. In addition, it showed the necessity to enlighten the rural populace on the importance of cleaning the surroundings near water sources so as to prevent water-borne diseases."
"Predicting Fecal Indicator Bacteria Using Spatial Stream Network Models in A Mixed-Land-Use Suburban Watershed in New Jersey, USA","T.T., Hsu, T. T.D.; D., Yu, Danlin; M., Wu, Meiyin","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","10.3390/ijerph20064743","20","6","2023","Good water quality safeguards public health and provides economic benefits through recreational opportunities for people in urban and suburban environments. However, expanding impervious areas and poorly managed sanitary infrastructures result in elevated concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria and waterborne pathogens in adjacent waterways and increased waterborne illness risk. Watershed characteristics, such as urban land, are often associated with impaired microbial water quality. Within the proximity of the New York–New Jersey–Pennsylvania metropolitan area, the Musconetcong River has been listed in the Clean Water Act’s 303 (d) List of Water Quality-Limited Waters due to high concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). In this study, we aimed to apply spatial stream network (SSN) models to associate key land use variables with E. coli as an FIB in the suburban mixed-land-use Musconetcong River watershed in the northwestern New Jersey. The SSN models explicitly account for spatial autocorrelation in stream networks and have been widely utilized to identify watershed attributes linked to deteriorated water quality indicators. Surface water samples were collected from the five mainstem and six tributary sites along the middle section of the Musconetcong River from May to October 2018. The log<inf>10</inf> geometric means of E. coli concentrations for all sampling dates and during storm events were derived as response variables for the SSN modeling, respectively. A nonspatial model based on an ordinary least square regression and two spatial models based on Euclidean and stream distance were constructed to incorporate four upstream watershed attributes as explanatory variables, including urban, pasture, forest, and wetland. The results indicate that upstream urban land was positively and significantly associated with the log<inf>10</inf> geometric mean concentrations of E. coli for all sampling cases and during storm events, respectively (p < 0.05). Prediction of E. coli concentrations by SSN models identified potential hot spots prone to water quality deterioration. The results emphasize that anthropogenic sources were the main threats to microbial water quality in the suburban Musconetcong River watershed. The SSN modeling approaches from this study can serve as a novel microbial water quality modeling framework for other watersheds to identify key land use stressors to guide future urban and suburban water quality restoration directions in the USA and beyond."

Floods exacerbate public health issues by spreading water-borne infectious diseases such as diarrhea through the destruction of sanitation facilities and contamination of drinking water. There has been a shortage of studies regarding the magnitude of diarrheal disease in flood-prone areas. Therefore, this research aimed to evaluate the prevalence of diarrheal disease and its predictors among under-five children living in flood-prone localities in the south Gondar zone of Northwest Ethiopia. Method: A community-based cross-sectional research was carried out in flood-prone villages of the Fogera and Libokemkem districts from March 17 to March 30, 2021. Purposive and systematic sampling techniques were used to select six kebeles and 717 study units, respectively. Structured and pretested questionnaires were used to collect the data. A multivariable analysis was performed to determine the predictors of diarrheal disease, with P-value <0.05 used as the cut-off point to declare the association. Result: The prevalence of a diarrheal disease among under-five children was 29.0%. The regular cleaning of the compound [AOR: 2.13; 95% CI (1.25, 3.62)], source of drinking water [AOR: 2.36; 95% CI: (1.26, 4.41)], animal access to water storage site [AOR: 3.04; 95% CI: (1.76, 5.24)], vector around food storage sites [AOR: 9.13; 95% CI: (4.06, 20.52)], use of leftover food [AOR: 4.31; 95% CI: (2.64, 7.04)], and fecal contamination of water [AOR: 12.56; 95% CI: (6.83, 23.20)] remained to have a significant association with diarrheal diseases. Conclusion: The present study found that the prevalence of the diarrheal disease among under-five children was high. Routine compound cleaning, the source of drinking water, animal access to a water storage site, vectors near food storage sites, consumption of leftover food, and fecal contamination of water were significant predictors of diarrheal disease. Therefore, it is advised to provide improved water sources, encourage routine cleaning of the living area, and offer health education about water, hygiene, and sanitation."

There is a need for predicting FIO levels to inform the public and reduce exposure. Data-driven models are one of the main tools being considered as predictive models. However, identifying the main inputs of the data-driven models is a major challenge in developing FIO predictor models. This paper develops a data-driven model for FIO concentration prediction based on a limited number of critical input variables. Essential variables were identified with be a combination of the gamma test and Genetic Algorithm (Gamma-GA test). Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and linear regression models were developed using these two variable identification approaches for comparison. The models were applied to a case study, and it was found that the model using the Gamma-GA test has a high potential to predict FIO levels more accurately, although this requires further investigation with different case studies. A correlation analysis was required prior to the variable identification approaches in this study. The need of this analysis highlights the significance of understanding the waterbody and the data set in the development and application of data-driven models. Models using a Gamma-GA test were more capable of predicting extreme (high) FIO concentrations, making a Gamma-GA test more suitable for a bathing water quality early warning system. The importance of nonlinearity in such predictive models was also demonstrated by the better performance of nonlinear ANN models compared with linear regression models regardless of the variable identification approaches used. This paper highlights the importance of nonlinearity in bathing water quality prediction and encourages further utilization of nonlinear models for this application."

The methodology consists of 1) catchment surveys complemented by literature data where needed for probabilistic estimates of daily produced fecal indicator (FIBs, E. coli, enterococci) and zoonotic reference pathogen numbers (Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium and Giardia) excreted by human and animal sources in a river catchment, 2) generating a hypothesis about the dominant sources of fecal pollution and selecting a source targeted monitoring design, and 3) verifying the results by comparing measured concentrations of the informed choice of parameters (i.e. chemical tracers, C. perfringensspores, and host-associated genetic microbial source tracking (MST) markers) in the river, and by multi-parametric correlation analysis. We tested the approach at a study area in Vienna, Austria. The daily produced microbial particle numbers according to the probabilistic estimates indicated that, for the dry weather scenario, the discharge of treated wastewater (WWTP) was the primary contributor to fecal pollution. For the wet weather scenario, 80–99 % of the daily produced FIBs and pathogens resulted from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) according to the probabilistic estimates. When testing our hypothesis in the river, the measured concentrations of the human genetic fecal marker were log<inf>10</inf> 4 higher than for selected animal genetic fecal markers. Our analyses showed for the first-time statistical relationships between C. perfringens spores (used as conservative microbial tracer for communal sewage) and a human genetic fecal marker (i.e. HF183/BacR287) with the reference pathogen Giardia in river water (Spearman rank correlation: 0.78–0.83, p < 0.05.

Following this trend, infectious disease outbreaks associated with their consumption have been reported more frequently. Molluscs are a diverse group of organisms found wild and farmed. They are common on our tables, but unfortunately, despite their great taste, they can also pose a threat as a potential vector for numerous species of pathogenic microorganisms. Clams, in particular, might be filled with pathogens because of their filter-feeding diet. This specific way of feeding favors the accumulation of excessive amounts of pathogenic microorganisms like Vibrio spp., including Vibrio cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Arcobacter spp., and fecal coliforms, and intestinal enterococci. The problems of pathogen dissemination and disease outbreaks caused by exogenous bacteria in many geographical regions quickly became an unwanted effect of globalized food supply chains, global climate change, and natural pathogen transmission dynamics. Moreover, some pathogens like Shewanella spp., with high zoonotic potential, are spreading worldwide along with food transport. These bacteria, contained in food, are also responsible for the potential transmission of antibiotic-resistance genes to species belonging to the human microbiota. Finally, they end up in wastewater, thus colonizing new areas, which enables them to introduce new antibiotic-resistance genes (ARG) into the environment and extend the existing spectrum of ARGs already present in local biomes. Foodborne pathogens require modern methods of detection. Similarly, detecting ARGs is necessary to prevent resistance dissemination in new environments, thus preventing future outbreaks, which could threaten associated consumers and workers in the food processing industry."

To characterize and analyze drinking water quality parameters, 21 water samples were collected, of which 11 water samples were collected from sources (spring, borehole, and river), 4 from service reservoirs, and 6 from tap water. The mean values of the parameters were as follows: total dissolved solids (TDS) (142.79 mg/L), temperature (22.08°C), turbidity (9.49 NTU), electrical conductivity (EC) (250.14°μS/cm), pH (7.45 mg/L), fluoride (1.15 mg/L), nitrate (NO3-) (2.91 mg/L), total hardness (TH) (57.45 mg/L), calcium (41.7 6 mg/l), magnesium (10.74 mg/L), phosphate (0.44 mg/L), sulfate (3.99 mg/L), residual chlorine (1.53 mg/L), alkalinity (196.39 mg/L), and microbiological (total coliform and coliform/CFU) which were the main physiochemical parameters analyzed for the study. The findings revealed that the majority of the water quality parameters tested were within the WHO and National Drinking Water Quality Standards (NDWQS). However, some of the parameters such as temperature, turbidity, fluoride, and residual chlorine did not meet the standards. The mean temperatures at the source, reservoir, and tap water were 22.01°C 22.5°C,and 21.83°C, respectively. Turbidity levels in source samples ranged from 10 to 45 NTU, with a mean of 24.5 NTU, exceeding the WHO's recommendation of less than 5 NTU. The Boko Alamura well had a high fluoride content (3.9 mg/l), which was above the WHO and NDWQS permissible limits. There was no free residual chlorine in the tap water sample. The results show that the Hawassa drinking water supply did not contain total or fecal coliform in any of the samples tested. The overall WQI for the water source, reservoir, and tap water was also determined to be 89, 71, and 69.7 points, respectively. Therefore, based on the WQI result, Hawassa drinking water quality is good for the source, reservoir, and tap water."

Concerns also were raised about exposure risk from waterfall mist to visitors and staff. The U.S. Geological Survey and the National Park Service collaborated on a study to collect 21 water-quality samples from 8 creek sites and 3 quarries in 2018 and analyzed them for over 250 water-quality parameters and contaminants. Additional samples were collected in August 2019 to assess the waterfall mists from Winnewissa Falls. Nutrient concentrations in the creek and quarries were elevated in 2018, indicating they are affected by agricultural inputs. All sample concentrations for nitrate and total nitrogen in Pipestone Creek exceeded Minnesota standards and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency nutrient criteria. Minnesota standards and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency nutrient criteria for total phosphorus also were exceeded in some of the quarry samples. Twenty of 210 micropollutants had measurable concentrations: 13 pesticides, 5 pharmaceuticals, and 2 other types of micropollutants. Atrazine, deethylatrazine, and metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid were detected in all 21 samples collected during the study. The five pharmaceuticals detected were acetaminophen, gabapentin, gemfibrozil, metformin, and oxycodone. Gabapentin (10 of 21 samples) and metformin (8 of 21 samples) were the most commonly detected pharmaceuticals. None of the detected micropollutant concentrations exceeded any Minnesota standards or U.S. Environmental Protection Agency aquatic life benchmarks, except the acute toxicity benchmark for nonvascular plants for atrazine. Two cyanotoxins, anatoxin-a and microcystin, were detected, but concentrations were below U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for swimming or recreation. Notably, total coliform, fecal coliform, and Escherichia coli were detected in all creek samples, and concentrations generally decreased downstream, suggesting contamination potentially occurred upstream from the monument. Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis was not detected in any creek sediment samples but was detected in three water samples from the creek. Three organisms were detected in the 2019 water and mist sampling from Winnewissa Falls. Two of these organisms can cause illness in humans (Cryptosporidium and Legionella), and a third (ruminant Bacteroides) is an indicator of manure contamination. Despite few samples, pathogen-positive water samples and air sampling demonstrated the feasibility and utility of the mist sampling approach outlined in this report."

This review aimed to evaluate the quality of drinking water in Ethiopia based on the concentration status of physicochemical and bacteriological parameters and its risk factors. Different studies in most parts of Ethiopia indicated that physicochemical quality of drinking water meet the prescribed standard limit, but in some parts of Ethiopia, water did not meet quality standard. Accordingly, an overall coliform count of drinking water in different areas of Ethiopia indicated that drinking water was at risk. Microbiological implications in the country showed that considerable amounts of drinking water were tainted with E. coli and fecal coliforms, which indicated the existence of dangerous pathogens. The quality issues several parts of Ethiopia were significantly influenced by poor handling practices. Consequently, proper handling practices of drinking water both at the source and point of use is essential to have a safe water supply and thereby protect public health. In order to guarantee that people have access to safe and clean water. The review’s findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced water quality monitoring and treatment in Ethiopia."

It is widely accepted that monitoring of microbial community is important for the diagnosis of fish diseases. Many fish diseases, especially those caused by bacteria or viruses, can lead to serious economic losses to fish. FAO reported that good-quality fish should have counts of total coliforms and fecal coliforms which should not exceed 100 and 10CFU/g, respectively. In general, many studies on northern Delta lakes, Egypt, showed bacterial indicators with a higher range than FAO recommendation. The microbiological examination of the water source is absolutely necessary in order to detect the type of bacteria being transferred into the fish. It can serve as a guide to monitoring and protecting fish quality and, consequently, our health. In Egypt, several studies have recorded that some lake fishes are infected internally and externally, with exceptionally high amounts of bacteria at the gills, skin, and intestines. Various infectious diseases, such as photobacteriosis, vibriosis, and streptococcosis, have been detected in several outbreaks in wild and cultured fish confirming that some lake fishes are heavily contaminated and dangerous for human health. There is a need for great efforts and cooperation between the different authorities to protect the lakes from pollution and reduce environmental risks. These efforts can be achieved through the treatment of agricultural and industrial drainage, besides sewage, discharging into lakes through establishing treatment stations or sedimentation basins in order to improve the quality of the lake water and, consequently, the fish’s health. Also, regular assessment of pollutants in the lakes is very essential for lake fish sustainability."
"Physicochemical and Microbiological Characterization of Effluents from the Mohammed VI University Hospital in Marrakech and Study of TheirImpact on the Environment","A., Ait Bella, Ayoub; H., Abdessamad, Hejjaj; H., Lafrikh, Hayat; E.H., El Azzouzi, El Habib","Ecological Engineering and Environmental Technology","10.12912/27197050/162026","24","4","2023","Water pollution from sewage has become a subject of considerable public and scientific concern, given its demonstrated extreme toxicity to human health and biological ecosystems. Hospital wastewater poses a serious health risk to staff, the public, and the environment. This study was conducted to determine the physical, chemical and biological parameters of hospital wastewater from Mohammed VI University Hospital in Marrakech, which is discharged into the municipal sewage system, where it mixes with sewage from urban areas without prior treatment. This study was conducted between October 2022 and January 2023 with a sampling frequency of 15 days each. Hospital wastewater samples were collected at the main collector of all manholes in the hospital.Physicochemical characterization of the effluents from each department showed that they are heavily polluted with organic matter, with average values in the range of 750 mg/L COD, 512.14 mg/L BOD<inf>5</inf> and 879.86 mg /L TSS. These values are higher than those recommended in the Moroccan discharge standards. Total phosphorus, sulfates, nitrates and nitrites are 5.92 mg/L, 427.97 mg/L, 7.39 mg/L and 0.60 mg/L, respectively. Bacteriological characterization shows that fecal coliform bacteria reach 12×106 CFU/100 mL. These effluents also contain pathogens responsible for nosocomial infections, especially Staphylococcus aureus. The ratio COD /BOD<inf>5</inf> is about 1.46, a value indicating that hospital wastewater is readily biodegradable. Therefore, proper treatment of these hospital effluents is essential due to their physicochemical and pathogenic bacterial load, which can negatively affect public health and carry the risk of spreading epidemic diseases."
"Impact of waste treatment through genetic modification and reuse of treated water on human health","H., Kumar, Hemant; A., Sharma, Aradhana",NA,"10.1016/B978-0-323-96124-0.00001-5",NA,NA,"2023","Day by day, we are getting surrounded by toxic chemicals that is why the demand is to learn sustainable technologies to guard environment and human health which is the major challenge of the current scenario. Different technologies are currently in practice to decontaminate the environment and safeguard human health; however, these technologies are chemical consuming and quite expensive thus give rise to secondary pollution and are nonecologically friendly. To conquer these constraints, genetic engineering approaches are significant to design transgenic microorganisms and plants to enrich biodetoxification and biodegradation of environmental pollutants for long-lasting development. Genetically modified organisms provide great possibility for environment remediation. Reuse wastewater to a mark depending upon the dimension of treatment holds some biological and chemical contaminants which are potentially harmful to the exposed population (buy contact by inhalation or by injection). The use of partially treated wastewater for irrigation is helpful in agriculture but might be associated with human health risks. Report from distinct locations globally relates to microbial outbreaks with reuse of wastewater for irrigation. The probability were notable among children and immune-compromised individuals the in immune-competent adults. Primarily skin and intestinal infection were widespread among individuals infected via occupation exposure and injection. Crop contamination with enteric virus bacterial pathogens fecal coliforms and parasite as well as existence of antibiotic Residues and occurrence of antibiotic resistance gene have also been evinced. It would be appropriate to adhere to World Health Organization's guidelines for the wastewater reuse and to sanitation safety plans. Furthermore, development in hygiene practices can also provide control against adverse health impact. Principally, the goal of wastewater management is the sustainable development of natural resources as well as safeguarding humankind and environment."

Since domestic water is the water most consumed by Lebanese people, cleaning household water tanks is important to prevent their exposure to pathogenic microorganisms. Generally, all the stages of the value chain of the Lebanese water sector are still imperfect. Thus, the domestic water should be regularly tested, especially in the impoverished landmarks where water quality is the worst. The aim of this study is to evaluate the physicochemical parameters and microbiological quality of the water in the storage tanks of homes in Sidon, Lebanon. Fifty water samples were collected aseptically from domestic water storage tanks. The microbiological assessment was performed using basic plating techniques. Identification of isolated bacteria was performed using MALDI-TOF-MS. Physicochemical parameters were assessed using titration, pH, and conductivity measurements. Antibiotic-susceptibility testing was performed using antibiotic disks. Screening for virulence genes in bacteria was carried out via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Most of the physicochemical parameters were within the permissible limits of the World Health Organization (WHO) for drinking water. The heterotrophic plate count (HPC) varied between the water samples. The total coliform, fecal coliform, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) contaminate was 54%, 20%, and 16% in each of the samples, respectively. Other bacteria isolated from household water included intestinal Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (68%), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (68%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (22%). Other predominant isolates recovered from the samples were also identified. The bacterial isolates showed a prevalence of resistance and intermediate resistance against the tested antibiotic agents. Multi-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected in 21% of the collected S. aureus, using cefoxitin agent and mecA gene detection. A prevalence of virulence genes in both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus was also noticed. Our data show that Sidon domestic water is not suitable for either drinking or home applications."

The consumption of microbiologically contaminated drinking water has been reported to cause diarrhoea, mortality, and morbidity in children under the age of five years. This study evaluated the microbiological pathogens detected in municipal drinking water and diarrhoea trends for children under 5 years of age in South Africa between 2008 and 2018. A trends analysis study was conducted using secondary data on diarrhoea for children under the age of five years and microbial drinking water quality compliance. A negative correlation was found between the occurrence of microbial pathogens in water, morbidity, and mortality rates of children under the age of 5 years in South Africa. As compliance status improved, the mortality rate among children under 5 years old decreased by 31% over the study period. A conclusion can thus be drawn that the microbiological pathogens detected in drinking water at levels complying with SANS 241:2015 Edition 2 standards and diarrhoea incidences were not the primary cause of the mortality of children under 5 years old in South Africa between 2008 and 2018."

The aim of this study was to assess physicochemical and microbial quality of drinking water stored in slum households of Hawassa City, Ethiopia. Cross-sectional study was conducted and a total of 120 water samples were collected from 60 households (60 tap, 60 households) to test the quality. Wagtech Potalab + PTW − 1000 was used to test the parameters. Physicochemical parameters—temperature, turbidity, pH and residual free chlorine were measured. Presence of total and faecal coliform bacteria was tested using the Wagtech membrane filtration procedure. Heads of the households were asked about the case of diarrhoeal diseases in any of their family members. Data were statistically analysed and compared with World Health Organization (WHO) standards. Paired t test was used to analyse the mean difference between tap and household water samples. Binary logistic regression was used to investigate any significant association between presence of faecal coliform in the water samples and occurrence of diarrhoeal diseases. Eight (13.3%) tap and 28 (46.7%) household water samples were found positive for total coliform; five (8.3%) tap and 19 (31.7%) household water samples were positive for faecal coliform. Eleven (18.3%) household water samples had faecal coliform 10–100 CFU/100 ml, which falls under high-risk category based on WHO standard. The paired t test (p < 0.05) showed significant mean difference between faecal coliform count of the tap and household water samples. The binary logistic regression analysis implied the odds for occurrence of diarrhoeal disease is 17.33 more in households with positive faecal coliform results (p < 0.05). It is concluded that there was a significant level of faecal contamination of drinking water at the household level. Therefore, it is recommended that continuous health education on drinking water handling should be given to slum households."

E. coli concentrations in the floating villages (3.6 × 103 and 5.7 × 103 CFU/100 mL during the low- and high-water seasons, respectively) were significantly higher than those in other lake sites (4.0 × 101 and 7.0 × 100 CFU/100 mL during the low- and high-water seasons, respectively) and rivers (3.3 × 102 and 8.9 × 102 CFU/100 mL during the low- and high-water seasons, respectively), most likely because fecal materials from the boathouses were discharged without treatment. At most of the lake sampling sites remote from the boathouses, the E. coli concentration was lower during the high-water season than that during the low-water season, due to dilution by lake water. E. coli colonies detected during monitoring were isolated for pathotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, beta-lactamase gene detection, and multilocus sequencing typing (MLST). Of the 659 E. coli isolates, 101 (15.3%) were diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC). The prevalence of DEC (52.2%) in the floating villages during the low-water season was higher than that during the high-water season (4.2%) and that in other sites during both seasons (10.6–21.3%). The DEC isolates from the floating villages during the low-water season showed high antimicrobial resistance, including ampicillin (83.4%) and ciprofloxacin (83.4%), and frequently possessed a beta-lactamase gene (bla<inf>TEM</inf>) (83.4%). MLST analysis indicated that the predominant sequence type (ST) of DEC isolates from the floating villages possibly originated from humans, whereas more diverse STs were detected in isolates from other sites.

Effluents arising from human and animal gut microbiomes highly influence water quality. Wastewater pollution is, therefore, frequently monitored using bacterial indicators (BI). However, threats to public health arise from the frequent incidence of wastewater-mediated viral infections–undetected by BI. Moreover, the enteric viromes contaminating wastewater are characterized by high abundance, genetic diversity and persistence in various water environments. Furthermore, humans usually suffer a minimum of a single acute diarrheal episode over their lifetime arising from extraneously acquired enteric microbiomes. A wide range of management methods are employed—in particular, microbial source tracking (MST) approaches to confront infections arising from exposure to contaminated wastewater. This review elaborates the viral contamination of treated wastewater and associated public health issues. Latterly, we discuss the various management strategies of wastewater pollution using conventional fecal indicators, viral indicators and human viral surrogates, with particular interest in the pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV). Globally, PMMoV has been detected in rivers, aquifers, irrigation systems, and coastal and marine waters at high prevalence rates and concentrations greater than 105 genome copies per liter (gc/L). PMMoV was also found in almost all untreated wastewater environments. PMMoV concentrations in wastewater vary from 103 to 107 gc/L. These values are more than the maximum recorded viral indicator concentrations in wastewater for other proposed indicators. Limited variability in the daily concentrations of PMMoV in fecal wastewater has been studied, with an estimated average concentration of 105 gc/L with insignificant seasonal variability. The information summarized in this article offers fundamental knowledge for decision making in terms of defining the suitability criteria of candidate fecal indicators, risk assessment application and efficient wastewater management."

SARS-CoV-2 RNA—quantified in genomic copies per liter (gc/L) of sampled water—was not detected in groundwater, but was detected and quantified in samples of surface water (two out of 43; 8035 and 23,757 gc/L) and in drinking water (one out of 43 samples; 7463 gc/L). The study also detected and quantified Norovirus RNA, intending to confirm the use of this enteric virus to assess variations in fecal matter throughout the sampling campaign. The samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA also had the highest concentrations of Norovirus RNA—including the drinking water sample, which proved negative for fecal enteric bacteria (FIB). These results indicate that, to protect human health, it is advisable to continue monitoring these viruses, and noroviruses as fecal indicators (FI) as well—especially in low-flow water bodies that receive wastewater."
"Fecal microbiome transplantation attenuates manganese-induced neurotoxicity through regulation of the apelin signaling pathway by inhibition of autophagy in mouse brain","J., Liu, Jingjing; X., Zhang, Xin; X., Ta, Xiaojuan; M., Luo, Miaomiao; X., Chang, Xuhong; H., Wang, Hui","Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety","10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113925","242",NA,"2022","Manganese (Mn) is a common environmental pollutant. Mn exposure can lead to neurodegenerative diseases resembling Parkinson's disease, and has become a major public health concern. However, the mechanism of Mn-induced neurotoxicity in the brain is not clear. Fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) may alleviate the neurotoxicity of Mn exposure by remodeling the gut microbiota. In this study, MnCl<inf>2</inf> (manganese chloride) was administered to mice as in drinking water (Mn: 200 mg/L), and fecal matter from donor mice was administered by oral gavage every other day to the recipient mice. The Mn exposure model (Mn group) and FMT model (Mn+FMT group) were established and analyzed 5 weeks post-exposure. The Wipi1 gene exhibited the most significant increase associated with Mn exposure and Mn+FMT treatment groups based on transcriptome analysis. Combined analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics demonstrated that the apelin signaling pathway is the main pathway affected by FMT during Mn exposure. Immunofluorescence and Western blot showed that the expression of key proteins (Beclin-1, LC-3B, and PINK1) associated with autophagy in the hippocampus was robustly activated in the Mn exposure group, but attenuation was observed in Mn+FMT mice, suggesting a critical role of autophagy in neurotoxicity induced by Mn exposure. Our research provides evidence for the neurotoxic effects of Mn exposure through autophagy activation and provides an underlying mechanism of FMT protection against Mn-induced neurotoxicity through regulation of the apelin signaling pathway."

Despite SARS-CoV-2 being an enveloped virus, which is highly susceptible to environmental conditions (temperature, solar/UV exposure). This review provides insight into the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to contaminate groundwater through burial sites, the impact of various types of burial practices on SARS-CoV-2 survival, and current knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to ensure that humans and ecosystems are adequately protected from SARS-CoV-2. Data available shows temperature is still likely to be the driving factor when it comes to survival and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Research conducted at cemetery sites globally using various bacteriophages (MS2, PRD1, faecal coliforms) and viruses (TGEV, MHV) as surrogates for pathogenic enteric viruses to study the fate and transport of these viruses showed considerable contamination of groundwater, particularly where there is a shallow vadose zone and heterogeneous structures are known to exist with very low residence times. In addition, changes in solution chemistry (e.g., decrease in ionic strength or increase in pH) during rainfall events produces large pulses of released colloids that can result in attached viruses becoming remobilised, with implications for groundwater contamination. Viruses cannot spread unaided through the vadose zone. Since groundwater is too deep to be in contact with the interred body and migration rates are very slow, except where preferential flow paths are known to exist, the groundwater table will not be significantly impacted by contamination from SARS-CoV-2. When burial takes place using scientifically defensible methods the possibility of infection will be highly improbable. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has helped us to prepare for other eventualities such as natural disasters where mass fatalities and subsequently burials may take place in a relatively short space of time."

However, the presence of the above symptoms does not always indicate the presence of human enteroviruses. It is critical to understand human enteroviruses in water. Human enteroviruses may withstand changing environmental conditions and persist in during extended periods of time in the environment, becoming the cause of diarrheal diseases. As a result, human pathogenic viruses are increasingly likely to emerge as important warning indicators of water scarcity. Human adenoviruses and other viruses have been recommended as potential indicators for high-quality detection of human-origin organisms that contaminate water systems.

The goals of this study were to (i) identify seasonal differences in Escherichia coli and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron concentrations, (ii) evaluate environmental drivers influencing microbial contamination during baseflow, snowmelt, and summer rain seasons, and (iii) relate seasonal changes in B. thetaiotaomicron to anticipated gastrointestinal infection risks. Water chemistry data collected during three hydroclimatic seasons from 64 Michigan watersheds were analyzed using seasonal linear regression models with candidate variables including crop and land use proportions, prior precipitation, chemical parameters, and variables related to both wastewater treatment and septic usage. Adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) linear regression with bootstrapping was used to select explanatory variables and estimate coefficients. Regardless of season, wastewater treatment plant and septic system usage were consistently selected in all primary models for B. thetaiotaomicron and E. coli. Chemistry and precipitation-related variable selection depended upon season and organism. These results suggest a link between human pollution (e.g., septic systems) and microbial water quality that is dependent on flow regime."

Therefore, quantitative microbial risk assessment based on Monte Carlo simulation was utilized in this research to assess the seasonal variations of health risks of the three enteric bioaerosols among exposure populations (academic visitors, field engineers, and office staffs) in a WWTP equipped with rotating-disc and microporous aeration modes. The results show that the concentrations of the three airborne bacteria from the rotating-disc aeration mode were 2–7 times higher than the microporous aeration mode. Field engineers had health risks 1.5 times higher than academic visitors due to higher exposure frequency. Health risks of airborne Enterococcus in summer were up to 3 times higher than those in spring and winter. Similarly, health risks associated to E. coli aerosol exposure were 0.3 times higher in summer compared to spring. In contrast, health risks associated with fecal coliform aerosol were between 2 and 19 times lower in summer compared to spring and winter seasons. Data further suggest that wearing of N95 mask could minimize health risks by 1–2 orders of magnitude.

A comparitive assessment of physico-chemical variables (pH, EC, TDS, DO, BOD, turbidity and NO<inf>3</inf>), microbiological parameters (total coliform bacteria, fecal coliform bacteria, fecal streptococci and escherichia coli) and toxic metals (As, Cr, Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) suggested a decrease of 20% in the contaminant ratio during the lockdown period in comparison to the pre-lockdown period. The Health risk assessment models (HQ, HI, and TCR) highlighted carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic hazards for both children and adults through the ingestion and dermal adsorption exposures. The HI values for both As and Cr exceeded the acceptable limit (>1) during the lockdown period, but the potential risk for children and adults remained low in compaisio with the pre-lockdown period. Our results suggested that the Thamirabarani River system remained hostile to human health even during the lockdown period, and it requires regular monitoring through a volunteer water quality committee with private and government participations."

We used data acquired in La Paz, Bolivia to characterize the risk of disease that aerosolized enteric pathogens may pose through food, fomites and inhalation (all followed by ingestion). Three reference pathogens were selected to conduct the assessment: enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Shigella flexneri, and Campylobacter jejuni. Inhalation followed by ingestion had the highest median infection risk per event i.e. 3 × 10−5 (3 infections for every 100,000 exposures), compared to contaminated food e.g. 5 × 10−6 and fomites e.g. 2 × 10−7, all for C. jejuni infections. Our sensitivity analysis showed that bacterial fluxes from the air were the most influential factor on risk. Our results suggest that fecal bacterial aerosols from OWCs present non-negligible risks of infection in La Paz, with median annual infection risks by C. jejuni being 18 (food), and 100 (inhalation) times greater than the EPA's standard for drinking water (1 × 10−4). We included two of the QMRA models presented here in a novel web application we developed for user-specified application in different contexts."
"Solar disinfection – An appropriate water treatment method to inactivate faecal bacteria in cold climates","A., Juvakoski, Anni; G., Singhal, Gaurav; M.A., Manzano, Manuel A.; M.Á., Moriñigo, Miguel Ángel; R., Vahala, Riku; I., Levchuk, Irina","Science of the Total Environment","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154086","827",NA,"2022","Solar disinfection (SODIS) is an inexpensive drinking water treatment method applied in tropical and sub-tropical low-income countries. However, it has been unclear whether it functions adequately also in colder climates. To investigate this issue, SODIS experiments were performed in the humid continental climate of Finland by exposing faecally contaminated drinking water to natural solar radiation at different water temperatures (8–23 °C) and UV intensities (12–19 W/m2) in polyethylene (PE) bags. To establish an adequate benchmark, SODIS experiments with the same experimental design were additionally conducted in the Mediterranean climate of Spain in typical conditions of SODIS application (~39 °C and 42 W/m2). Out of all experiments, the highest coliform and enterococci inactivation efficiencies in terms of lowest required doses for 4-log disinfection (25 Wh/m2 and 60 Wh/m2, respectively) were obtained in humid continental climate at the lowest studied mean water temperature (8–11 °C). Despite the low mean UV irradiance (~19 Wh/m2), 4-log disinfection of coliforms and enterococci were also reached fast in these conditions (1 h 27 min and 3 h 18 min, respectively). Overall, the doses required for disinfection increased as the water temperatures and UV intensities of the experiments rose. Disinfection of 4-logs (> 99.99%) of both bacteria was reached in all SODIS experiments within 6 h, suggesting SODIS could be a sufficient household water treatment method also in colder climates, unlike previously thought. The effects of different water temperatures on bacterial inactivation were also tested in the absence of sunlight. Together the obtained results indicate that while water temperatures below or close to the optima of coliforms and enterococci (~10 °C) alone do not cause inactivation, these temperatures may enhance SODIS performance. This phenomenon is attributed to slower bacterial metabolism and hence slower photorepair induced by the low water temperature."

In February 2020, an internal audit identified the high bacterial counts within the DUWLs at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi and this paper discusses a pragmatic approach to improving the water quality of DUWLs. A three-person committee was developed and the area for improvement was identified as the contaminated DUWLs. Distilled water samples from two dental units were first assessed as baseline in July 2020. The process changes were then implemented which included daily flushing of the dental unit waterlines and € shock treatment' using A-dec ICX capsules. Subsequently, the units were tested after intervention on 24 August 2020 and water from all 16 dental units assessed on 20 November 2020 and again on 22 April 2021. The samples from all the dental units assessed showed marked reduction in bacterial counts and compliance with the Centers for Disease Control guidelines after intervention. All the dental units showed minimal bacterial counts; however, a slightly low pH was noted in the final round of water testing. DUWLs are heavily contaminated with microbes and pose potential risk both to the patient as well as the DHCPs. This study suggests that chemical disinfection using A-dec ICX tablets and flushing as an effective method of reducing the bacterial load in DUWLs."

Arid environmental conditions also add more stress on supplied water to mass gathering events. Herein, we assess the quality of the water supply (desalinated 95% and groundwater 5%) in Makkah city, Saudi Arabia during a mass gathering event in 2019 (9.6 million people) for religious purposes. Fifty five samples were randomly collected from nine different districts of Makkah city, analyzed for TDS, turbidity, pH, EC, free Cl<inf>2</inf>, Al, Cd, Pb, Cr, F, major ions, coliform and E.coli bacteria and were finally used to estimate the water quality index (WQI). Major ions, trace elements and heavy metals analyses show values below permissible limits in most of the samples, while a few samples show slightly higher values. No bacterial count found in any sample. WQI values of all fifty-five samples were below 50 and were identified as “excellent water”. The WQI variations could be attributed to the distribution network conditions rather than a direct impact of adding groundwater with uncontrolled chemical composition. The use of WQI to report the quality of water during mass gathering events to governmental authorities has been proved to be beneficial and should be applied for further mass gathering events worldwide."

The major objectives of the present study are to analyse changing nature of heavy metals (Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Cr, and Fe) and microbial load (TVC, TC, and FC) of river water and to identify heavy metals impact on water quality and human health in pre, during, and after unlocking of COVID-19 lockdown. Here, a total of 33 water samples have been collected in the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and unlock phases. The results showed that decreasing trend of the microbial load was found in the lockdown phase. Heavy metal pollution index (HPI) illustrated that all samples are highly polluted (HPI > 150) during the pre-lockdown phase, while during the lockdown phase; HPI showed that around 54.54% of samples have been positively changed (low pollution level). During the unlock phase, 45.45% of samples were again amplified to the high pollution level. Pearson’s correlation coefficient and hierarchical cluster analysis indicated strong relation among heavy metals with faecal coliform at a 0.05% level of significance. Noncarcinogenic hazard index (HI) shows the higher possibility of health risk (HI > 1) particularly for children in all the phases and during the lockdown phase, 36.36% of samples showed no possible health risk for adults (HI < 1). However, HI of dermal contact showed no possible health risk for children and adults in the assessment periods.

"Comprehensive evaluation of the possible impact of roofing materials on the quality of harvested rainwater for human consumption","B.M., Tengan, Briana Mwinkom; O.Y., Akoto, Osei Yaw","Science of the Total Environment","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.152966","819",NA,"2022","Water is a vital natural resource that influences life and contributes to domestic and industrial activities. Availability and accessibility of safe water sources are crucial for a country's economic growth. Harvesting of roof runoffs is an alternative source of water used for domestic purposes. However, the quality of harvested rainwater can be affected by roofing materials. This research seeks to assess heavy metals concentration, physicochemical and bacteriological parameters in roof runoffs and estimate the water quality index and health risk these metals pose to consumers. Rainwater samples were collected from Aluzinc, Aluminum, Galvanized, and Asbestos roofing materials within the Ejisu municipality. Rainwater collected directly from the sky was used as control. All runoffs from the four roofing materials recorded Cd, Fe, Cr, turbidity, pH, E.coli, total and fecal coliform levels above WHO limit for drinking water. There was a significant variation in pH, EC, Zn, Cd, Cr, Fe, E. coli, total and fecal coliform levels between control samples and roof runoffs (p < 0.05). The estimated water quality index for runoffs from the four roofing materials exceeded 100 indicating their unsuitability for drinking. Cadmium recorded the highest non-cancer health risk to children and adults in all the roof runoffs. Hazard quotients (HQs) above one were recorded for a child (HQ = 40.1) and an adult (HQ = 13.6) via dermal exposure to Cd in runoff from Aluminum roofing material. Hazard quotient of 9.53 and 4.08 were estimated for a child and an adult respectively via oral exposure to Cd in runoffs from Asbestos roofing material. The estimated cancer risks were above 10−3 for a child and an adult via oral and dermal exposure to Cd in all roof runoffs, suggesting a possible cancer health effect. The study concludes that the four roofing materials impact negatively on the quality of runoffs."

We monitored five natural water sources that were used for human consumption in the highlands of Ecuador and analyzed the total coliforms and E. coli before and after BCWF installation. The results indicated a variable bacterial contamination (29–300 colony-forming units/100mL) in all unfiltered samples, and they were considered as high risk for human consumption, but after filtration, no bacteria were present. Moreover, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli with bla<inf>TEM</inf>, bla<inf>CTX-M9</inf>, and bla<inf>CTX-M1</inf> genes, and two E. coli classified in the clonal complex ST10 (ST98) were detected in two of the locations sampled; these strains can severely impact public health. The clonal complex ST10, found in the E. coli isolates, possesses the potential to spread bacteria-resistant genes to humans and animals. The results of the use of BCWFs, however, argue for the filters’ potential impact within those contexts, as the BCWFs completely removed even antibiotic-resistant contaminants from the water."

Historical flood data was used to build severity indices and to test for correlations with risk of infection estimates. Results indicate similar maximal pathogen densities in urban flood water samples to those from wastewater treatment plants. Significant positive correlations between risk of G. lamblia infection and severity indices suggest that floods could act as an important source of pathogen transmission in Mexico City. Risk of infection to G. lamblia is greater in the city's periphery, which is characterized by high marginalization levels. We argue that these risks should be managed by engaging citizens and water and health authorities in decision making."

Surface water sampling was carried out at different locations of the Brahmaputra River, its tributary Bharalu River (an unlined urban drain), and Dipor Bill Lake (Ramsar-recognized wetland). Both PPCPs and viruses were at high concentrations (e.g. up to 970 ng L−1 caffeine, 2.5 × 103 copies mL−1 pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV)) at the confluence points of urban drains and the river, while they were mostly undetectable at both upstream and downstream locations, implying strong self-purification ability of the river. All the analysed PPCPs and viruses were at much higher concentrations during pre-monsoon i.e., winter than during monsoon, implying heavy dilution and temperature effect during the monsoon. Overall, PPCPs and viruses were more correlated in monsoon but the risk quotient in the urban tributary was higher in pre-monsoon (e.g. 5061 in pre-monsoon and 1515 in monsoon for caffeine). PMMoV was found to be an excellent faecal pollution indicator due to its prevalence, detectability and specificity in all seasons. Overall, the seasonal fluctuations of the non-enveloped viruses monitored in this study is likely to be relevant for SARS-CoV-2. We contribute to address the literature scarcity pertaining to seasonal variations in the prevalence of viruses and their concurrences with contaminants of emerging concern."

A total of 31 drinking water samples were collected from restaurants (n = 18), health center (n = 9), and residences (n = 4) located in Chattogram City, Bangladesh. The isolation and identification of coliforms was performed on selective media with a combination of biochemical and molecular analysis. PCR amplification of the LacZ, uidA and int1 genes was carried out for the identification of the coliform and fecal coliform and antibiotic resistant gene, respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed according to the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method with McFarland standard against three selective antibiotics including co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and ampicillin. Of 31 drinking water samples, coliforms were detected within 32% (n = 10) of the water samples, nine samples were collected in restaurants and one sample in a residence. But no coliform was detected in the drinking water of the health center. Among the identified coliforms, the prevalence of fecal coliforms and the int1 gene was 60% (n = 6) and 40% (n = 4), relatively.

One hundred per cent of the drinking water was of acceptable quality in terms of pH (6.5–8.5), NC (50 mg/L) and NL (3 mg/L). Total hardness contents exceeded the recommended standard in 37.5% of borehole water samples and 91.7% of tap water samples, respectively. Total coliform and E. coli were found in 40% and 15% of water samples. Tap water samples had the greatest contamination, with TC and E. coli levels of 41.7% and 16.7%, respectively. Although not statistically significant, sampling from the beginning of the nipple line (p = 0.101, OR = 7.357, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.678–79.886) and not cleaning the rearing equipment regularly (p = 0.098, OR = 3.966, 95% CI: 0.766–20.280) were factors affecting the TC growth.

Critical Control Points (CCP) were determined with the aid of a decision tree and questions were made to characterize whether identified hazards constitute actual CCPs and should be monitored. When deviations were detected, corrective actions were performed and action plans were used for following-up and implementation of corrective actions. Finally, microbiological and physicochemical parameters were analyzed and the obtained results were regarded as appropriate. Therefore, it is shown that HACCP constitutes an effective tool for identification of hazards, establishment of corrective actions and monitoring of the critical control points that impact the process and the quality of the final pharmaceutical product most significantly."

Boussellam Valley crosses the Quaternary formations, which dominate the extent of the plain surrounding the region of Sétif in the North-East of Algeria. It is one of the main water resources, mainly for drinking water supply and irrigation. The shallow water table composed of the geological formations containing this aquifer is very heterogeneous in texture and varies considerably from upstream to downstream of the sub-watershed. Thus, the North and East zones are marked by chloride-calcium facies, the central part by a Bicarbonate-calcium facies. At the same time, sulfate-magnesium facies characterize the West zone. This study aimed to evaluate the pollution by organic elements: nitrites, nitrates, and microbiological elements: total and fecal coliforms and streptococci and their impact on the water quality. Samples were collected during May and June 2021 from 5 stations along the valley, and 18 wells were spread out on the plain. The analysis of nitrites and nitrates was carried out by liquid chromatography. In addition, the colony counting of coliforms and streptococci was carried out according to the recommendations of the Algerian water company. The results show an increase in the concentration of nitrites, nitrates, total and fecal coliforms, and the streptococci, particularly in valley waters with very high levels that exceed the normal threshold of drinking water. This increase may be due to wastewater discharges and the intensive use of fertilizers, septic tanks, leaching of animal manure, runoff water, and rearing of domestic or wild animals. The increased levels of nitrites, nitrates, total and fecal coliforms, and the streptococci increase the risk of the vulnerability of the waters of the plain to pollution and degradation of surface waters and the environment in general."

Nowadays, there are several different types of drinking water, including water cooler dispensers (WCDs), which are becoming a popular device in educational institutions. Therefore, this study aims to determine the bacteriological quality of drinking water from WCDs, and inspect their hygienic conditions in students' dormitories at a university in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand. Methods: Water samples from 53 WCDs installed in 13 dormitories were collected and analyzed coliform bacteria by using the multiple-tube fermentation technique. The hygienic inspection form from the Department of Health, Ministry of Public Health, was used for inspection of the sanitary conditions. The hygienic factors of water cooler sanitation were analyzed using the generalized linear model. Results: Coliform bacteria were found in 10 out of 53 samples; moreover, Escherichia coli was recovered in three samples. Maintenance/cleaning and monitoring were the most two sanitary issues found in 100% (53/53) of the WCDs. Location and features of machine were found the correlation with the prevalence of coliform bacteria in drinking water. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest regular monitoring of water quality in educational institutions. Also, the Sanitary Standard and Operational Procedures (S.S.O.P.) should be developed to improve the hygienic conditions of the water cooler dispensers."
"Drinking Water Quality and Public Health in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal: Coliform Bacteria, Chemical Contaminants, and Health Status of Consumers","B., Sarkar, Bibudhendra; E.J., Mitchell, Erika J.; S.H., Frisbie, Seth H.; L.D., Grigg, Laurie D.; S., Adhikari, Sagar; R.M., Byanju, Rejina Maskey","Journal of Environmental and Public Health","10.1155/2022/3895859","2022",NA,"2022","Residents of Nepal's Kathmandu Valley draw drinking water from tube wells, dug wells, and stone spouts, all of which have been reported to have serious water quality issues. In this study, we analyzed drinking water samples from 35 tube wells, dug wells, stone spouts, and municipal tap water for bacterial and chemical contaminants, including total and fecal coliform, aluminum, arsenic, barium, beryllium, boron, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, fluoride, iron, mercury, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lead, antimony, selenium, thallium, uranium, vanadium, and zinc. We also asked a sampling of households who used these specific water sources to rate the taste of their water, list any waterborne diseases they were aware of, and share basic health information about household members. This survey provided us with information from 146 households and 603 individuals. We found widespread bacterial contamination of water sources, with 94% of sources having detectable total or fecal coliform. Nepal Drinking Water Quality Standards and World Health Organization (WHO) Drinking-Water Guidelines or health-based values were exceeded for aluminum (max = 0.53 mg/L), arsenic (max = 0.071 mg/L), iron (max = 7.22 mg/L), and manganese (max = 3.229 mg/L). The distribution of water sources with high arsenic, iron, and manganese appeared to be associated with floodplain deposits. Mixed effects logistic regression models were used to examine the interactions between social factors and water contaminants and their effects on household members' health. Consumers of water sources with both high and low concentrations of manganese were less likely to have a positive attitude towards school than those whose water sources had moderate concentrations of manganese. Social factors, especially education, played a large role in predicting individual health outcomes. Household taste ratings of drinking water were not correlated with iron or manganese concentrations, suggesting that WHO's reliance on aesthetic criteria for these contaminants instead of formal drinking-water guidelines may not be sufficient to protect public health."

Around half of the total population in Myanmar has to consume water from unimproved sources. The prevalence of diarrhea due to contaminated drinking water is high even in urban areas. The urban community may expect the provision of municipal water supply in the near future if the current revolution against military dictatorship succeeds. However, the rural areas have less or no chance to get quality water because of a lot of other prioritized tasks. Household water treatment is encouraged to be implemented as one of the national water safety plans for rural water supply in Myanmar. This study explored the diarrhea prevention awareness of the rural community using a questionnaire survey. The microbial quality parameters of drinking water sources were also examined. Fecal coliform contamination was detected in all examined drinking water sources. A significant association was found between drinking untreated water and the occurrence of diarrhea. The percentage of people who applied the diarrhea preventive measures was low. Even if they knew how to prevent the disease, very few people applied the measures in reality. Therefore, measures to cause behavioral change should be initiated, together with awareness raising, to promote diarrhea prevention in the community."

To explore the pollution status of FC in rivers of Kyrgyzstan, a mountainous country with traditional agro-pastoral economy, 184 water samples from the rivers of Kyrgyzstan in low and high river flow period were analyzed. Spatial autocorrelation and classical statistical methods were used to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution and driving factors of FC. The results showed that the surface water quality of Kyrgyz rivers was good, and the concentration range of FC was 0–23 MPN/100 mL. Temporally, the maximum FC concentration was 4 MPN/100 mL in low river flow period, while in the period of high river flow, the highest value reached to 23 MPN/100 mL. Spatially, the concentration of FC in high altitude areas was low, while that in the lowland areas was relatively high, which indicated that animal husbandry in high altitude areas contributed little to FC in rivers, and urban domestic sewage and agricultural activities in lowlands were the main pollution sources of FC in rivers. There was no correlation between FC and hardness, electrical conductivity (EC), pH and total organic carbon (TOC) in river water of Kyrgyzstan, and the distribution of FC in high river flow period was mainly driven by population and human modification of terrestrial systems. The results can provide a basis for the prevention and control of surface water FC pollution and related diseases in Kyrgyzstan."

Of the isolates, 13 (59.1%) were E. coli, while 9 (40.9%) were Klebsiella pneumoniae; 17 (77.3%) were isolated from the waste water and 5 (22.7%) were isolated from the recreational water. Six (27.2%) of them showed ESBL production phenotypically; however, PCR amplification of the ESBL genes showed that only five of them had at least one of the genes. The presence of ESBL bacteria in hospital waste water and surface waters highlights that water matrices are important routes of transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria."

In E. coli isolates from ECC plates without antibiotics from ten influent samples (n = 300), highest resistance was observed against ampicillin (16.6%), sulfamethoxazole (9.7%) and trimethoprim (9.0%), while in effluent samples (n = 262) it was against sulfamethoxazole (11.8%), ampicillin (11.5%) and tetracycline (8.8%). All isolates (n = 123) obtained on cefotaxime-containing plates were multidrug-resistant. Several clinically important antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were detected in 46 E. coli isolates subjected to whole-genome sequencing, including carbapenemases like NDM-6, VIM-1 and OXA-48-variant, as well as tigecycline resistance gene tet(X4). CTX-M-15 was the most prevalent (42.9%) extended-spectrum β-lactamase among cefotaxime-resistant isolates, followed by CTX-M-27 (31.4%) and CTX-M-14 (17.1%), resembling clinical prevalence in Norway. Most of the sequenced isolates carried other clinically relevant ARGs, such as dfrA17, sul1, sul2, tet(A), aph(6)-Id, aph(3’’)-Ib and aadA5. Sixteen different sequence types (STs) were identified, including ST131 (39.1%), ST38 (10.9%) and ST69 (8.7%). One E. coli isolate belonging to novel ST (ST11874) carried multiple virulence factors including genotoxin, salmochelin, aerobactin and yersiniabactin, suggesting that this isolate has potential to cause health concerns in future.

"Systematic assessment of SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater, rivers and drinking water – A catchment-wide appraisal","V., Masindi, Vhahangwele; S., Foteinis, Spyros; K., Nduli, Kefilwe; V., Akinwekomi, Vhahangwele","Science of the Total Environment","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149298","800",NA,"2021","Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) attracted attention in 2002 with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, caused by the SARS-CoV virus (mortality rate 9.6%), and gained further notoriety in 2012 with the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (mortality rate 34.3%). Currently, the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in 2019. The virus can pass to the faeces of some patients, as was the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses. This suggests that apart from the airborne (droplets and aerosols) and person-to-person (including fomites) transmission, the faecal–oral route of transmission could also be possible for HCoVs. In this eventuality, natural water bodies could act as a virus reservoir of infection. Here, the temporospatial migration and attenuation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in municipal wastewater, the receiving environment, and drinking water is evaluated, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in the South African setting. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was identified in raw wastewater influent but was below the detection limit in the latter treatment stages. This suggests that the virus decays from as early as primary treatment and this could be attributed to wastewater's hydraulic retention time (2–4 h), composition, and more importantly temperature (>25 °C). Therefore, the probability of SARS-CoV-2 virus transportation in water catchments, in the eventuality that the virus remains infective in wastewater, appears to be low in the South African setting. Finally, catchment-wide monitoring offers a snapshot of the status of the catchment in relation to contagious viruses and can play a pivotal role in informing the custodians and downstream water users of potential risks embedded in water bodies."

Given the limited availability of quantitative norovirus data to input to QMRA models, some studies have applied a conversion factor to estimate norovirus exposure based on measured fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations. We conducted a review of peer-reviewed publications to identify the concentrations of noroviruses and FIB in raw, secondary-treated, and disinfected wastewater. A meta-analysis was performed to determine the ratios of norovirus-FIB pairs in each wastewater matrix and the variables that significantly impact these ratios. Norovirus-to-FIB ratios were found to be significantly impacted by the norovirus genotype, month of sample collection, geographic location, and the extent of wastewater treatment. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of using a FIB-to-virus conversion factor in QMRA and found that the choice of conversion ratio has a great impact on estimated health risks. For example, the use of a conversion ratio previously used in the World Health Organization Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater predicted health risks that were significantly lower than those estimated with measured norovirus concentrations used as inputs. This work emphasizes the gold standard of using measured pathogen concentrations directly as inputs to exposure assessment in QMRA. While not encouraged, if one must use a FIB-to-virus conversion ratio to estimate norovirus dose, the ratio should be chosen carefully based on the target microorganisms (i.e., strain, genotype, or class), prevalence of disease, and extent of wastewater treatment."

Drinking water samples from 60 water dispensers of different type-brands were collected and tested for physicochemical and microbiological parameters by following WHO Drinking Water Quality guidelines. Also evaluated by questionnaires were hygienic standards and maintenance of water dispensers. The physicochemical analysis of all water samples did not exceed the reference values of the drinking water standard; the hardness value in only 13.3% of samples was slightly higher than the reference limit. The microbiological results indicated that total coliform and fecal coliform bacteria were found in 16.67% and 8.33% of total samples, respectively. Escherichia coli was not detected in any of the water samples. The assessment of factors influencing drinking water quality, location and pathogen source around water dispensers, hygienic environment, and maintenance of water dispensers had a significant effect on drinking water quality."

We developed region-specific models using mixed effects models to examine E. coli as a continuous variable and recommended thresholds of E. coli concentration (100 CFU/100 mL and 200 CFU/100 mL). Substantial clustering of E. coli values at the beach level was observed in Toronto, while minimal clustering was seen in Niagara, suggesting an important beach-specific effect in Toronto beaches. Air temperature and turbidity (measured directly or visually observed) were positively associated with E. coli in all models in both regions. In Toronto, waterfowl counts, rainfall, stream discharge and water temperature were positively associated with E. coli levels, while solar irradiance and water level were negatively associated. In Niagara, wave height and water level had a positive association with E. coli, while rainfall was negatively associated. The differences in regional models suggest the importance of a region-specific approach to addressing beach water quality. The results can guide beach monitoring and management practices, including predictive modelling."

A probabilistic human exposure (HE) model was created to determine exposure to faecal indicator bacteria (FIB): total coliforms (TC), E. coli and enterococci following application of bio-based fertiliser (dairy cattle slurry, digestate) to grassland; using a combination of experimental field results and literature-based data. This step was followed by a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) model for pathogenic E. coli based on a literature-based dose-response model. The results showed that the maximum daily HE (HE<inf>daily</inf>) is associated with E. coli for unprocessed slurry (treatment T1) on day 1, the worst-case scenario where the simulated mean HE<inf>daily</inf> was calculated as 2.84 CFU day −1. The results indicate that the overall annual probability of risk (P<inf>annual</inf>) of illness from E. coli is very low or low based on the WHO safe-limit of P<inf>annual</inf> as 10 −6. In the worst-case scenario, a moderate risk was estimated with simulated mean P<inf>annual</inf> as 1.0 × 10 −5. Unpasteurised digestate application showed low risk on day 1 and 2 (1.651 × 10 −6, 1.167 × 10 −6, respectively). Pasteurised digestate showed very low risk in all scenarios. These results support the restriction imposed on applying bio-based fertiliser if there is any rain forecast within 48 h from the application time. This study proposes a future extension of the probabilistic model to include time, intensity, discharge, and distance-dependant dilution factor. The information generated from this model can help policymakers ensure the safety of surface water sources through the quality monitoring of FIB levels in bio-based fertiliser."

Indigenous Mayans who already face disproportionate health challenges rely directly on the lake water. Our objectives were to: (1) estimate prevalence of shedding of water-borne fecal parasites among children 5 years of age and younger, (2) assess household-reported incidence of gastrointestinal illness in children, and (3) characterize water sources, treatment, and sanitation conditions in households. We hypothesized that household use of untreated lake water results in increased risk of shedding of parasites and gastrointestinal symptoms. A cross-sectional fecal sampling and physical exam of 401 children were conducted along with WASH surveys in partnership with healthcare providers in seven communities. Fecal samples were screened for Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum, using a rapid ELISA, with a portion examined by microscope. The prevalence of parasite shedding was 12.2% (9.7% for Giardia; 2.5% for Cryptosporidium). Risk factors for Giardia shedding included age 3 years or older (3.4 odds ratio, z-stat D 2.781 pD0:0054), low height-for-Age z-score (2.3 odds ratio, z-stat D 2.225, pD0:0216), lack of any household water treatment (2.5 odds ratio, z-stat D 2.492, p0:0012), and open access to household latrine (2.04 odds ratio, z-stat D 1.992, pD0:0464). The majority (77.3%) of households reported water treatment, boiling and gravity fed filters as the most widespread practices. The vast majority of households (92%) reported usage of a latrine, while 40% reported open and shared access beyond their household. An overwhelming majority of households reported diarrhea and fever several times per year or greater, with approximately half reporting vomiting at that frequency. Lake water use was identified as a risk factor for households reporting frequent gastrointestinal symptoms (odds ratio of 2.5, 4.4, and 2.6; z-stat of 3.10, 3.65, and 3.0; p-values of 0.0021, 0.0003, and 0.0028, for diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, respectively) in children 5 years of age and younger. The frequency of gastrointestinal illness with a strong link to lake drinking water cannot be explained by the prevalence of protozoa, and risk from other enteropathogens must be explored. Improving access to water treatment and sanitation practices could substantially reduce the parasite burden faced by developing children in the region."
"Legionella: A Promising Supplementary Indicator of Microbial Drinking Water Quality in Municipal Engineered Water Systems","C., Zhang, Chiqian; J., Lu, Jiangrang","Frontiers in Environmental Science","10.3389/fenvs.2021.684319","9",NA,"2021","Opportunistic pathogens (OPs) are natural inhabitants and the predominant disease causative biotic agents in municipal engineered water systems (EWSs). In EWSs, OPs occur at high frequencies and concentrations, cause drinking-water-related disease outbreaks, and are a major factor threatening public health. Therefore, the prevalence of OPs in EWSs represents microbial drinking water quality. Closely or routinely monitoring the dynamics of OPs in municipal EWSs is thus critical to ensuring drinking water quality and protecting public health. Monitoring the dynamics of conventional (fecal) indicators (e.g., total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and Escherichia coli) is the customary or even exclusive means of assessing microbial drinking water quality. However, those indicators infer only fecal contamination due to treatment (e.g., disinfection within water utilities) failure and EWS infrastructure issues (e.g., water main breaks and infiltration), whereas OPs are not contaminants in drinking water. In addition, those indicators appear in EWSs at low concentrations (often absent in well-maintained EWSs) and are uncorrelated with OPs. For instance, conventional indicators decay, while OPs regrow with increasing hydraulic residence time. As a result, conventional indicators are poor indicators of OPs (the major aspect of microbial drinking water quality) in EWSs. An additional or supplementary indicator that can well infer the prevalence of OPs in EWSs is highly needed. This systematic review argues that Legionella as a dominant OP-containing genus and natural inhabitant in EWSs is a promising candidate for such a supplementary indicator. Through comprehensively comparing the behavior (i.e., occurrence, growth and regrowth, spatiotemporal variations in concentrations, resistance to disinfectant residuals, and responses to physicochemical water quality parameters) of major OPs (e.g., Legionella especially L. pneumophila, Mycobacterium, and Pseudomonas especially P. aeruginosa), this review proves that Legionella is a promising supplementary indicator for the prevalence of OPs in EWSs while other OPs lack this indication feature. Legionella as a dominant natural inhabitant in EWSs occurs frequently, has a high concentration, and correlates with more microbial and physicochemical water quality parameters than other common OPs. Legionella and OPs in EWSs share multiple key features such as high disinfectant resistance, biofilm formation, proliferation within amoebae, and significant spatiotemporal variations in concentrations. Therefore, the presence and concentration of Legionella well indicate the presence and concentrations of OPs (especially L. pneumophila) and microbial drinking water quality in EWSs. In addition, Legionella concentration indicates the efficacies of disinfectant residuals in EWSs. Furthermore, with the development of modern Legionella quantification methods (especially quantitative polymerase chain reactions), monitoring Legionella in ESWs is becoming easier, more affordable, and less labor-intensive. Those features make Legionella a proper supplementary indicator for microbial drinking water quality (especially the prevalence of OPs) in EWSs. Water authorities may use Legionella and conventional indicators in combination to more comprehensively assess microbial drinking water quality in municipal EWSs. Future work should further explore the indication role of Legionella in EWSs and propose drinking water Legionella concentration limits that indicate serious public health effects and require enhanced treatment (e.g., booster disinfection)."

Despite the fact that the majority of the world population has met the Millennium Development Goals 7c (MDG7c) targets, more than 2.5 billion are still using unimproved sanitation facilities and affecting the safety of drinking water and public health. Because of this problem, a novel approach on ‘Non-Sewered Sanitation’ with decentralized treatment systems is being recognized as a promising alternative to accomplish the Sustainable Development Goal No. 6 (SDG6) targets on ‘Safe Water and Sanitation’ and bringing health benefits to the people. This study aimed to investigate the current status of access to improved sanitation facilities in relation to the MDG7c and SDG6 in Thailand and comparing with other countries, including the effects of unsafely managed fecal sludge (FS) on the prevalence of diarrhea and liver fluke infections. The prevailing constraints and weaknesses were identified, and effective sanitation management measures to accomplish SDG6 targets were recommended. Based on data collected from 20 cities located in the north and northeastern regions of Thailand during the period of 2015–2020, the sanitation facilities data on conventional centralized systems and FS management facilities that affect the prevalence of diarrhea and liver infections were analyzed and interpreted using statistical and response surface methodology techniques. The findings showed that most of the surveyed cities have achieved the MDG7c targets, but 70% of the FS generated from on-site sanitation systems are still unsafely managed, caused by limited expansion of sewage systems for wastewater collection and conveyance (with inadequate operation and maintenance) as well as the financial constraints, especially in areas outside of urban neighborhoods. The effective sanitation management practices to accomplish the SDG6 targets were proposed such as increasing the capacity of sanitation facilities to be 55,000 m3/day/30,000 households, designing appropriate FS collection program and treatment technology, and providing more awareness programs for safe sanitation management and health risk protection."

Physicochemical parameters for general water quality, detection of coliform bacteria and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing were performed on all samples. Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) testing indicated a wide distribution of coliform bacteria in all sampled freshwater sites with evidence of fecal coliform in most locations. Importantly, evidence of coliform bacteria was found in most seawater samples inside and along the reef, apart from those samples taken ~20 km offshore. Illumina 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region confirmed the presence of various types of harmful bacterial species, namely from the Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcae, Streptococcaceae, and Vibrionacea families. By combining the sensitivity of FIB testing and next-generation sequencing, we were able to show the extent of potential contaminations in fresh and seawater samples and simultaneously identify the potential pathogenic bacterial genera present.

A quantitative microbial risk assessment was conducted using a dataset of E. coli concentrations in three Sinaloa rivers from 2013 to 2018 to define the level of faecal contamination and estimate the risks of acquiring gastrointestinal infections (GI) from recreational exposure. Faecal contamination was conditioned by river flow or time (p > 0.05) and increase during summer in urban areas. The national laws classify these rivers as suitable for recreational activities. However, the dose-response model estimated the probability of acquiring GI during recreational use (>1.0 × 10–4), which implies the occurrence of 283 and 788 GI annually in adults and children, respectively. This research exposes the risk for the development of GI in the population of the region, especially in children; and justifies the controlling microbiological quality of rivers used for recreational use."
"Associations between faecal pathogen detection, E. coli concentrations and youth exhibitor biosecurity practices at California county fairs","M.E., Daniels, Miles E.; M.H., Smith, Martin H.; A.E., Packham, Andrea E.; C.L., Meehan, Cheryl L.; A., Bautois, Audrey; B.A., Byrne, Barbara A.; W.A., Smith, Woutrina A.","Zoonoses and Public Health","10.1111/zph.12815","68","7","2021","Interactions with livestock in public settings such as county and state fairs can expose people and other livestock to faecal material capable of spreading zoonotic enteric pathogens. The goal of this study was to understand these risks by screening livestock faeces (n = 245) and livestock bedding (n = 155) for common zoonotic pathogens (Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella and Campylobacter spp.) and by measuring faecal indicator, Escherichia coli, concentrations in drinking water (n = 153), feed containers (n = 124) and bedding material (n = 157) in four livestock species (cattle, sheep, goats and swine) from county fairs in California, USA. Results indicated that sheep were most likely to have pathogens detected in faeces and that Giardia was the most frequently detected pathogen in both faeces (11%) and bedding (21%) across all livestock species. Additionally, increasing the number of animals in a holding pen at fairs, increasing the stocking density of animals in transport trailers to fairs, and having access to water in transport trailers significantly increased the odds of detecting pathogens in livestock faeces of any animal species. Observing solid material in water, stale feed and soiled bedding was associated with detecting higher E. coli concentrations. These findings provide evidence of faecal pathogens present at county fairs and suggest that site observations can aid in assessing levels of faecal exposure. The findings also indicate that the use of biosecurity measures such as (a) routine changing of livestock drinking water, feed and bedding, (b) not overstocking animals in holding pens and trailers and (c) keeping species in separate holding areas may reduce the risk of humans and livestock being exposed to faecal pathogens."

Thus, the water quality in this river concerns the health of local inhabitants. The present study reveals seasonal variations of various physicochemical and heavy metals parameters and microbial load of water at 15 sites from Qena to Sohag cities, Egypt. The water is fresh with TDS ≤ 270 and 410 mg L−1 in summer and winter, respectively. Fe, Mn, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn concentrations were within drinking water specification in both seasons except Cr and Cd in summer. Viable numbers of total coliform, fecal coliform, and fecal streptococci were recorded in both seasons with fecal streptococci's disappearing in winter. The concentrations of salts and ions in winter were higher than summer due to decreased water quantity and flow rate in this season. On the other hand, heavy metals and bacteria were higher in summer owing to the rain and weathering of upstream rocks and increasing of human activities during the summer. The calculated water quality index (WQI) depicted that the chemical quality of water was poor for drinking and treatment, especially biological treatment, which is required before the water is supplied for drinking. Human health risk assessment factors such as probable daily intake, hazard quotient, and carcinogenic risk indicated high risks of Cr, Cd, and Ni for adults and children in both seasons. The non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks are mainly posed by Cr. The WQI values for the other water uses indicated the marginal quality for aquatic life, fair for irrigation, and fair in summer to good in winter for livestock consumption. The irrigation water quality parameters indicated that the water could be used to irrigate all soils and crops except the hazard of biological contamination. The water–rock interaction controls water chemistry besides the contribution of human activities. The agricultural, industrial, and municipal wastewaters were the main contributors to water pollution and should be treated before discharge into the Nile River. Source and drinking water should be monitored continuously to prevent related human waterborne diseases."

A total of 185 WWTPs inflow samples were collected over the period consisting of both the first wave (mid-March to June) and the second wave (July to November). Concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (N1 and N2 assays) were quantified in these wastewaters as well as those of Human adenoviruses (HAdV) and JC polyomavirus (JCPyV), as indicators of human faecal contamination. SARS-CoV-2 N gene daily loads strongly correlated with the number of cases diagnosed one week after sampling i.e. wastewater levels were a good predictor of cases to be diagnosed in the immediate future. The conditions present at small WWTPs relative to larger WWTPs influence the ability to follow the pandemic. Small WWTPs (<24,000 inhabitants) had lower median loads of SARS-CoV-2 despite similar incidence of infection within the municipalities served by the different WWTP (but not lower loads of HAdV and JCPyV). The lowest incidence resulting in quantifiable SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater differed between WWTP sizes, being 0.11 and 0.82 cases/1000 inhabitants for the large and small sized WWTP respectively."

It is known that these indicators are associated with disease causing organisms which are of great concern to public health. This study assessed the relationship between coliform bacteria and water geochemistry in surface and ground water systems in the Tarkwa mining area using logistic regression models. In surface water sources, higher values of chloride (OR = 0.891, p<005), phosphates (OR = 0.452, p<0.05), pH (OR = 0.174, p<0.05) and zinc (OR = 0.001, p<0.05) were associated with lower odds of faecal coliform contamination. In groundwater sources, higher values of phosphates (OR = 0.043, p<0.001), total dissolved solids (OR = 0.858, p<0.05), turbidity (OR = 0.996, p<0.05) and nickel (OR = 6.09E-07, p<0.05) implied noncontamination by faecal coliform. However, higher values of electrical conductivity (OR = 1.097, p<0.05), nitrates (OR = 1.191, p<0.05) and total suspended solids (OR = 1.023, p<0.05) were associated with higher odds of faecal coliform contamination of groundwater sources. Nitrates and total suspended solids, in this case, were completely mediated by the heavy metals. For total coliform in surface water systems, higher values of magnesium (OR = 1.070, p<0.05) was associated with higher odds of total coliform contamination while higher values of phosphates (OR = 0.968, p<0.05) was associated with lower odds of total coliform contamination although the presence of heavy metals completely mediated these relationships. For ground water systems, higher values of pH (OR = 0.083, p<0.05), phosphates (OR = 0.092, p<0.05), turbidity (OR = 0.950, p<0.05) and chloride (OR = 0.860, p<0.05) were associated with lower odds of total coliform contamination. However, higher values of total suspended solids (OR = 1.054, p<0.05) and nitrates (OR = 1.069, p<0.05) implied contamination of total coliform in ground water sources. The relationship between nitrates and total coliform were mediated by the heavy metals. This study establishes the need to monitor, manage and remediate surface and ground water sources for potential disease causing microbes in ways that takes into consideration the factors that create different conditions in the two water systems. This study validates the usefulness of statistical models as tools for preventing surface and ground water contamination."

From this point of view, wastewater-based epidemiology represents a modern diagnostic tool for describing the health status of a certain part of the population in a specific region. Hospital wastewater is a complex mixture of pharmaceuticals, illegal drugs, and their metabolites as well as different susceptible and antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, including viruses. Many studies pointed out that wastewater from healthcare facilities (including hospital wastewater), significantly contributes to higher loads of micropollutants, including bacteria and viruses, in municipal wastew-ater. In addition, such a mixture can increase the selective pressure on bacteria, thus contributing to the development and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. Because many pharmaceuticals, drugs, and microorganisms can pass through wastewater treatment plants without any significant change in their structure and toxicity and enter surface waters, treatment technologies need to be improved. This short review summarizes the recent knowledge from studies on micropollutants, pathogens, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and viruses (including SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater from healthcare facilities. It also proposes several possibilities for improving the wastewater treatment process in terms of efficiency as well as economy."

Contamination levels have been monitored in past studies, yet the sources, routes, and extents of contamination are not always clear. We evaluated pollution from municipal wastewater (MWW) discharge and investigated fecal contamination by Escherichia coli (E. coli) in three agricultural fields on the outskirts of Hue City, Vietnam. After E. coli concentration was determined in irrigation water (IRW), MWW, soil, vegetables (VEG), and manure, its dispersion from MWW was tracked using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and phylogenetic analyses during the wet and dry seasons. IRW was severely contaminated; 94% of the samples were positive with E. coli exceeding the stipulated standards, while VEG contamination was very low in both seasons. The confirmed total number of isolates was comparable between the seasons; however, results from MLST and phylogenetic clustering revealed more links between the sites and samples to MWW during the wet season. The wet season had four mixed clusters of E. coli isolates from multiple locations and samples linked to MWW, while only one mixed cluster also linking MWW to IRW was observed during the dry season. The most prevalent sequence type (ST) complex 10 and two others (40 and 155) have been associated with disease outbreaks, while other STs have links to major pathotypes. Irrigation canals are significant routes for E. coli dispersion through direct links to the urban drainage-infested river. This study clarified the genotype of E. coli in Hue city, and the numerous links between the samples and sites revealed MWW discharge as the source of E. coli contamination that was enhanced by flooding."

Samples were analysed for physicochemical parameters including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), Escherichia coli (E. coli) contamination, nitrite, and nitrate (NO2- and NO3-). Whilst the average concentrations of NO3- in the water samples were within the permissible limits of 50 mg L−1 set by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and NEQS two villages exceeded the safety limits. Non-carcinogenic health risks of NO3- were estimated in terms of average daily dose (ADD) and hazard quotient (HQ). The HQ values for NO3- were > 1 for children signifying potential health risks; however, the adult population had HQ < 1 which indicates no risk. Groundwater samples tested positive for E. coli contamination in 13 villages, suggesting that residents may be living at risk of various microbial diseases due to drinking of contaminated water. The findings of this study provide valuable baseline data for groundwater researchers, policymakers, and the local public health department."

The lockdown has decreased microbial populations and heavy metals. Fe, Cu, Cd, Ni, Pb and Cr exceeded the drinking water limits, respectively, in 77%, 45%, 27%, 18%, 9% and 91% of the pre-lockdown samples. During the lockdown period, Fe, Cu and Cd concentrations in 23% and Cr in 50% of the samples exceeded the limits. Heavy Metal Pollution Index (PI) expressed that 27%, 64% and 9% of the pre-lockdown samples represented ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’ pollution categories, respectively, but 68% and 32% of the lockdown period samples represented ‘low’ and ‘medium’ categories, respectively. The Metal Index (MI) exposed that all samples of pre-lockdown were under the seriously affected category, whereas 54% and 46% of lockdown samples were under strongly and seriously affected categories, respectively. Health risk evaluation predicted that 95%, 91% and 86% of pre-lockdown samples and 45%, 36% and 33% of lockdown period samples were at risk among children, teenagers and adults, respectively. As there is no integrated study on river water quality of COVID-19 lockdown this work is uniquely carried out by combining heavy metal pollution, microbial contamination and human health risk evaluation."
"Removal and survival of fecal indicators in a constructed wetland after uasb pre-treatment","F., Conti, Fabio; E.C., Rada, Elena Cristina; P., Viotti, Paolo; M., Raboni, Massimo","Sustainability (Switzerland)","10.3390/su13169302","13","16","2021","The experimentation plant, based on a sub-surface horizontal flow phytodepuration (SSHFP) unit with a pre-treatment by an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor, proved valuable in treating the sewage of a small rural community located in north Brazil. During a sixmonth trial, the plant achieved an average removal efficiency of 98.2% (1.74 log removal) for fecal coliforms (FC) and 96.0% (1.40 log removal) for Enterococci (EN), as well as 95.6% for BOD<inf>5</inf>, 91.0% for COD,00 and 95.4% for suspended solids (SS). The contribution of the UASB reactor to this overall performance was very significant as, alone, it achieved a yield of 62.7% for FC and 60% for EN, in addition to 65.2% for BOD<inf>5</inf> and 65.0% for SS. EN was chosen, in addition to FC, because of its higher specificity and strong environmental persistence, leading to an increased risk to human health. In fact, the experimental results confirmed its lower removal efficiency compared to FC. The mechanical and biological mechanisms that led to such a removal efficiency of the two fecal indicators (FIs) are outlined in the article. The same mechanisms led to a good level of equivalence between the removal efficiency of the two FIs with the removal efficiency of SS and BOD<inf>5</inf>, for both the whole plant and the UASB reactor alone. The research demonstrated the close correlation between the concentrations of EN and FC for the plant effluent. This correlation can be explained by the following mathematical expression of the regression line Log EN = 0.2571 Log FC + 3.5301, with a coefficient of determination R2 = 0.912. This implies that the concentration of the more specific indicator EN could be calculated, with acceptable approximation, from the simple analysis of FC and vice versa. The experimental plant brought important health benefits to the local population. In particular, there were no significant odor emissions; moreover, the risk of fecal pathogenic diseases was drastically reduced; finally, there was no proliferation of insects and other disease vectors, due to the absence of stagnant or semi-stagnant water exposed to the atmosphere."

Consequently, intestinal parasites may be present in this body of water, posing risks to water safety and human health. This study was able to detect the protozoan parasite, Giardia duodenalis, in three Laguna Lake stations and seven tributary rivers in a 13-month monitoring period by PCR amplification of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene of Giardia cysts concentrated from water samples. The pathogen was present in 37.7% of tributary samples (n = 69) and 16.7% of lake samples (n = 36). Notable frequencies of detection were observed in four tributary rivers —Bagumbayan, Taguig (66.7%); Santa Rosa, Laguna (55.6%); San Cristobal, Cabuyao, Laguna (44.4%); and Biñan, Laguna (42.9%). All test SSU rRNA gene sequences were identified as human-infective genotypes of G. duodenalis predominated by Assemblage A (94.1%). Furthermore, analysis of the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) gene revealed the possible presence of mixed genotypes in at least two samples. These results support the pressing need to include protozoan pathogen monitoring in Laguna Lake and its tributaries to prevent Giardia infection in humans and animals. This study also recommends microbial source tracking to identify fecal pollution sources and aid in regulation of waste discharges into the lake and its tributaries."

Travellers to South Asia from Western Europe have high rates of acquisition of faecal CTX-M-producing E. coli (CTX-M-EC). Aims: To determine the conjugative ability of CTX-M-EC acquired by healthy volunteers after travel to South Asia, the proportion of travel-acquired CTX-M-EC where bla<inf>CTX-M</inf> is encoded on a plasmid vs on the bacterial chromosome, and the relatedness of travel-acquired CTX-M-EC plasmids to previously sequenced plasmids. Methods: Faecal samples were collected pre- and post-travel from 23 volunteers who visited South Asia, and CTX-M-EC were cultured. After short- and long-read sequencing, 10 plasmid sequences were identified and compared with previously sequenced plasmids in GenBank. Conjugation to E. coli K-12 was undertaken using filter mating. Findings: Thirty-five percent of CTX-M-EC isolates tested transferred the bla<inf>CTX-M</inf> plasmid by conjugation. Travel-acquired CTX-M-EC carried bla<inf>CTX-M</inf> on a plasmid in 62% of isolates, whereas 38% of isolates had bla<inf>CTX-M</inf> on the chromosome. CTX-M-EC plasmids acquired after travel to South Asia had close homology to previously described epidemic plasmids which are widely disseminated in humans, animals and the natural environment. Conclusion: Globally successful epidemic plasmids are involved in the spread of CTX-M-EC. Targeted strategies may be used to displace such plasmids from the host strain as part of efforts in infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Bacteria with bla<inf>CTX-M</inf> plasmids were readily acquired by healthy volunteers, and were carried on return to the UK, providing opportunities for onward dissemination."

Currently, the whole world is fighting against this pandemic that is transmitted either through exposure to virus laden respiratory or water droplets or by touching the virus contaminated surfaces. The viral load in feces of an infected patient varies according to the severity of the disease. Subsequent detection of viral genome (SARS-CoV-2) in human feces and sewage systems is an emerging concern for public health. This also dictates to reinforce the existing sewage/wastewater treatment facilities. Rapid monitoring is the key to prevent and control the current mass transmission. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a potential epidemiology tool that can act as a complementary approach for current infectious disease surveillance systems and an early warning system for disease outbreaks. In a developing country like India, inadequate wastewater treatment systems, low-operational facility and relaxed surface water quality criteria even in terms of fecal coliform bacteria are the major challenges for WBE. Herein, we review the occurrence, transmission, and survival of SARS-CoV-2, and disinfection and potential of sewage surveillance as an early warning system for COVID-19 spread. We also discuss the challenges of open-defecation practices affecting sewage-surveillance in real-time in densely populated developing countries like India."

The aim of this study was to assess a possible association between basic sanitation indices and COVID-19 rates in all the 5570 municipalities of Brazil and its spatial distribution. Methods: Data of COVID-19 cases registered in Brazil from 28 February until 31 May 2020 and independent variables associated with basic sanitation were included. Results: High incidence rates were significantly associated with precarious water service index (0-25% coverage) and offstandard faecal coliforms index for tap water (5-50% and 75-100% of samples tested). A significant association between high mortality rates and sewage collection (0-25% coverage)/treatment (25-50% coverage) indices was also verified. In addition, clusters with significant spatial autocorrelation were identified mainly in the North and Northeast regions for mortality and incidence rates (high-high risk areas) and for offstandard faecal coliforms index. Those regions are considered the poorest in Brazil, presenting with low incomes, human agglomerations, as well as a poor basic sanitation system, which also hinder the implementation of COVID-19-preventative measures. Conclusions: A precarious basic sanitation infrastructure could potentially be associated with the high transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in Brazil."

This study aimed to compare two common approaches for quantifying Escherichia coli (E. coli) density in natural water versus the ColiPlate™ kit approach. For comparing methods, 41 field samples from natural water sources in Kentucky (USA) were collected. E. coli densities were then determined by (1) membrane filtration in conjunction with modified membrane‐thermotolerant E. coli (mTEC) agar, (2) Idexx Quanti‐Tray® 2000 with the Colilert® substrate, and (3) the Bluewater Biosciences ColiPlate kit. Significant correlations were observed between E. coli density data for all three methods (p < 0.001). Paired t‐test results showed no difference in E. coli densities determined by all the methods (p > 0.05). Upon assigning modified mTEC as the reference method for determining the World Health Organization‐assigned “very high‐risk” levels of fecal contamination (> 100 E. coli CFU/100 mL), both ColiPlate and Colilert exhibited excellent discrimination for screening very high‐risk levels according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (~89%). These data suggest ColiPlate continues to be an effective monitoring tool for quantifying E. coli density and characterizing fecal contamination risks from water."

The fecal-oral transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 and the role of the wastewater as a potential source of infection, more than ever highlights the importance of proper wastewater management during the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review represents a picture of the current state of hospital wastewater (HWW) management in Iran; an upper-middle income country with a paucity of proper data concerning HWW management and further provides suggestions for hospital wastewater management during COVID-19 pandemic in the country. We reviewed 31 papers that published from 2005-2020 evaluated 163 hospitals from 82 cities and 17 provinces. HWW generation in Iran varies from 354 to 1892 liter per bed per day (839±363 L/bed/d). BOD, COD and TSS in the raw HWW were in the range of 119-1270, 205-1611 and 58-464 mg/L, respectively. Total coliforms and/or total fecal coliforms were in the range of 105-108 (MPN/100 mL). 44.2 % of hospitals had an active WWTP at the time of the study from which, only 15.3 % complied with discharge standards. More than 55 % of the hospitals in Iran use no disinfection, and less than 7 % comply with the discharge requirements. HWW management in Iran is very poor and there has been no improvement in HWW management within the last decade. To best respond to this pandemic, responsible authorities should address wastewater management in hospitals."
"High fecal contamination and high levels of antibiotic-resistant enterobacteriaceae in water consumed in the city of Maputo, Mozambique","A., Salamandane, Acácio; F., Vila-Boa, Filipa; M.M., Ferreira, Manuel Malfeito; L.C., Brito, Luisa Castro","Biology","10.3390/biology10060558","10","6","2021","In the city of Maputo, Mozambique, food and water are often sold on the streets. Street water is packaged, distributed, and sold not paying attention to good hygienic practices, and its consumption is often associated with the occurrence of diarrheal diseases. Coincidentally, the increase of diarrheal diseases promotes the inappropriate use of antibiotics that might cause the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. In this context, the present study aimed to assess the microbiological quality of water sold on the streets of Maputo, as well as the antibiotic resistance profile of selected Enterobacteriaceae isolates. The 118 water samples analyzed were from street home-bottled water (n = 81), municipal water distribution systems (tap water) (n = 25), and selected supply wells in several neighborhoods (n = 12). The samples were analyzed for total mesophilic microorganisms, fecal enterococci, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio spp. The results showed a high level of fecal contamination in all types of water samples. In home-bottled water, fecal coliforms were found in 88% of the samples, and E. coli in 66% of the samples. In tap water, fecal coliforms were found in 64%, and E. coli in 28% of the samples. In water from supply wells, fecal coliforms and E. coli were found in 83% of the samples. From 33 presumptive Vibrio spp. colonies, only three were identified as V. fluvialis. The remaining isolates belonged to Aeromonas spp. (n = 14) and Klebsiella spp. (n = 16). Of 44 selected Enterobacteriaceae isolates from water samples (28 isolates of E. coli and 16 isolates of Klebsiella spp.), 45.5% were not susceptible to the beta-lactams ampicillin and imipenem, 43.2% to amoxicillin, and 31.8% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Regarding non-beta-lactam antibiotics, there was a high percentage of isolates with tolerance to tetracycline (52.3%) and azithromycin (31.8%). In conclusion, water in Maputo represents a risk for human health due to its high fecal contamination. This situation is made more serious by the fact that a relatively high percentage of isolates with multidrug resistance (40%) were found among Enterobacteriaceae. The dissemination of these results can raise awareness of the urgent need to reduce water contamination in Maputo and other cities in Mozambique."

Humans can be exposed to pathogenic microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria through numerous routes of transmission, including waterborne transmission. Accordingly, effective water disinfection processes are paramount for public health protection. In this study, the inactivation efficacy of P22 virus and Escherichia coli bacteria was tested using ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs), which provided effective disinfection of both waterborne microorganisms. Using a peak wavelength emission of 255, 265, or 285 nm, the batch-Test, UV LED collimated beam system demonstrated high inactivation potential for both microorganisms at all wavelengths, suggesting that it could be an effective alternative to typical, low-pressure (LP) or medium-pressure (MP), mercury-based UV systems. Increased inactivation kinetics for both microorganisms was observed with decreasing wavelength (255 > 265 > 285 nm). However, the trend reversed when accounting for energy efficiency of the systems (255 < 265 < 285 nm) due to the currently lower wall plug efficiency for lower UV LED wavelength emissions. Substantial improvements in LED efficiency are needed to make them energetically competitive with current LP and MP UV technologies."

The discharge of municipal effluents and other wastes has threatened coastal resources irrespective of local authorities colossal investment in their development. Strategic assessment and monitoring of water quality are essential pathways to reduce contaminant level of microbes responsible for waterborne diseases. As in Karachi's case study, two wastewater discharge drains were identified at Sea View, which is famous for recreational activities. These two primary discharge drains contained contaminants, including various pathogens that pollute the marine environment and disturb the ecosystem. The current study aims to assess the water quality along the beach through an in-depth monitoring program lasting from May till September 2020. The assessment focused on total coliform (TC) and faecal coliform (FC) counts; biochemical oxygen demand (BOD<inf>5</inf>) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Analysis of the results conclude that both discharge drains contained high levels of TC (1600 MPN or CFU per 100 mL of the sample) and FC (203 MPN per 100 mL). Moreover, COD and BOD levels were found to be high (COD 945 mg/L and BOD 410 mg/L). Hence, recreational activity may not be suitable near these discharge drains, indicating their association with high health risks."

Therefore, this study aimed at assessing prevalence of TTV in DWNWWS. The study systematically identified and meta-analyzed published studies on TTV prevalence in DWNWWS hosted in Dimensions, Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases using a random-effects model and mixed-effects meta-regression model for sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, the meta-analysis was stratified to estimate water type-specific TTV prevalence. The study found a total of 58 articles, of which 13 articles subdivided into 31 studies with 374 TTV positive cases and 862 total sample sizes were systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed. The pooled prevalence of TTV in DWNWWS was 37.18% (95%CI: 23.76–55.55%). Prevalence of TTV was significantly different across water types and it was 56.67% (95%CI: 36.94–75.46%) in wastewater, 26.72% (95%CI: 6.87–52.56%) in river water, and 17.17% (95%CI: 0.54–45.39%) in drinking water. TTV incidence in seawater and groundwater was 0% and 25.0% respectively. Funnel plots constructed and associated statistics of rank correlation test and Egger's regression test in this study, show lack of publication bias in the pooled prevalence of TTV in DWNWWS. Although, sample type (QM(df = 1) = 6.9656, p = 0.0083) and concentration methods (QM(df = 1) = 3.8055, p = 0.0511) significantly moderated and accounted for 15.39% and 6.00% of heterogeneity in the prevalence of TTV in DWNWWS respectively. In conclusion, research focus/monitoring activities on TTV is generally inadequate and potential risk of TTV in DWNWWS is underappreciated in most nations; the analyzed studies were from 7 countries (USA, Japan, Italy, Iran, Germany, Egypt, and Brazil). Finally, inefficient concentration method severely influences the prevalence of TTV in DWNWWS and could give rise to underestimation of TTV and mar TTV-based source-tracking of anthropogenic pollutions."

In this study, effects of seasonal variations on physicochemical parameters like pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), waterborne bacteria (total coliform and faecal coliform) and related risks on human health were analyzed in Rawalpindi and Islamabad cities by using standard methods of chemical and microbiological analysis. Results were cor-related with seasonal parameters (temperature, rainfall, etc.), and also showed that all the drinking water samples were found tasteless, colorless, and odorless. Other quality parameters were found within the recommended limits of the WHO guideline. However, significant decrease in DO level in the drinking water samples was found below the recommended level of WHO guide-lines. Similarly, bacterial growth was found varied in the different months and with the changing season pattern. No growth of Legionella spp. or V. cholera was found from the analyzed samples. Health risks survey showed that residents of the study area were using different means of water sources like water filtration plants, water supply, borewells, etc. People have good perception about water quality (83%). Majority of the residents (72%) were not satisfied about the water quality in Rawalpindi city as compared to Islamabad but the same number reported no regular monitoring of water quality. About 98% were familiar with the WBD and 93% educate their children about WBD. No separate record for WBD had been found in the hospitals to correlate the data with the diseases spread in the different seasons. It is suggested to maintain the separate record for WBD to correlate with the seasons along with regular monitoring of drinking water sources and check the sewerage contamination to avoid the risk of WBD."
"Implications of irrigation water quality on shallow groundwater in the Nile Delta of Egypt: A human health risk prospective","A.S., Abuzaid, Ahmed S.; H.S., Jahin, Hossam S.","Environmental Technology and Innovation","10.1016/j.eti.2021.101383","22",NA,"2021","Groundwater is the main source for drinking in Egypt, especially in rural communities; however, water quality of shallow aquifers is more susceptible to human activities. The current work aimed at evaluating groundwater quality for drinking and associated health risks in an area of the Nile Delta (30° 14″ 47″ to 30° 17′ 51″ N and 31° 17′ 38″ to 31° 20′12″ E) in response to irrigation water quality. Thirty groundwater samples were collected from three irrigated sites (ten samples from each site); the Nile freshwater (NFW), the agricultural drainage water (ADW), and mixed wastewater (MWW) irrigated sites. Overall, ranges of pH, Ca2＋, Mg2+, F−, NO<inf>3</inf>−, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn were within the permissible levels according to Egypt and WHO drinking water standards, while the count of total and fecal coliform bacteria exceeded safety limits. The water quality index indicated that samples from the NFW-, ADW- and MWW-irrigated sites had moderate to good, low, and low to moderate qualities, respectively. On average, the hazard index (HI) indicated no potential non-cancer risk for adults (HI < 1.0) in the three sampling sites, while children in the MWW-irrigated sites would suffer adverse health risks (HI > 1.0). The mean total cancer risk (TCR) was in the acceptable range (1.0 × 10−6 to 1.0 × 10−4) for adults in two sites (the NFW- and ADW-irrigated sites), while adults in the MWW-irrigated sites and children in all sampling sites would suffer cancer risks over the lifetime (TCR > 1.0 × 10−4). The potential cancer risk would be mainly due to Ni exposure via the oral route, and thus further management studies should be considered to mitigate the adverse effects. This study would provide a useful database for decision and policymakers for protecting shallow groundwater quality and reduce potential human health risks."

R.","Water (Switzerland)","10.3390/w13081110","13","8","2021","Even in countries with extensive sanitation systems, outbreaks of waterborne infectious diseases are being reported. Current tendencies, such as the growing concentration of populations in large urban conurbations, climate change, aging of existing infrastructures, and emerging pathogens, indicate that the management of water resources will become increasingly challenging in the near fu-ture. In this context, there is an urgent need to control the fate of fecal microorganisms in wastewater to avoid the negative health consequences of releasing treated effluents into surface waters (rivers, lakes, etc.) or marine coastal water. On the other hand, the measurement of bacterial indicators yields insufficient information to gauge the human health risk associated with viral infections. It would therefore seem advisable to include a viral indicator—for example, somatic coliphages—to monitor the functioning of wastewater treatments. As indicated in the studies reviewed herein, the concentrations of somatic coliphages in raw sewage remain consistently high throughout the year worldwide, as occurs with bacterial indicators. The removal process for bacterial indicators and coliphages in traditional sewage treatments is similar, the concentrations in secondary effluents remaining sufficiently high for enumeration, without the need for cumbersome and costly concentration procedures. Additionally, according to the available data on indicator behavior, which is still limited for sewers but abundant for surface waters, coliphages persist longer than bacterial indicators once outside the gut. Based on these data, coliphages can be recommended as indicators to assess the efficiency of wastewater management procedures with the aim of minimizing the health impact of urban wastewater release in surface waters."

The concentrations of Escherichia coli, faecal coliforms, Salmonella, Shigella, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium and Campylobacterwere determined using standard microbiological methods, which involve the use of a membrane filter technique. The water samples were filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane filter using vacuum pump pressure and plated on selective agar for the bacteria under test. The number of colonies of the bacterial growth observed after the incubation period was counted and recorded. The physicochemical properties of the water were determined using standard methods. The risk of Salmonella, Shigella, Clostridium and Campylobacter infections resulting from the ingestion of water from the borehole and well was estimated. The results showed that the levels of enteric bacteria in the borehole were higher than those in the well. The mean levels of E. coli in water from the borehole and well were 3.3 and 1.7 log<inf>10</inf> cfu/100 ml, respectively, and exhibited a negative relationship with salinity (r= -0.53). The estimated risks of infection associated with the pathogens in water from the borehole and well were greater than the acceptable risk limit of 10-4 and followed this order Clostridium < Salmonella < Campylobacter< Shigella. The findings of this study suggest recent and continuous faecal contamination of the two groundwater sources, thus exposing the residents relying on the water for drinking to potential risks of gastrointestinal infections."

The results indicate that the minimum number of samples collected per parameter (free residual chlorine, turbidity, counts of total and fecal coliforms (Escherichia coli)) was not fulfilled, the collection of samples throughout the year was irregular and the representability of sampling points considered strategic was low (48% of municipalities). Besides, municipalities with a high prevalence for intestinal parasite protozoa were also the ones that had the highest counts for coliforms and the reverse can also be observed, indicating a transmission through contaminated drinking water. Despite the increased participation of municipalities in water surveillance actions during the studied period, it is necessary to implement managerial measures to improve the system, aiming to correct flaws and inconsistencies in the application of the water quality monitoring protocol."

Hence, the need to ascertain the drinking water quality and associated human health risks were considered highly significant. In this study, eighty water samples (40 for chemical parameters and 40 for biological parameters) were randomly collected from schools and colleges at Mingora city, district Swat. The mean values of physico-chemical water quality parameters such as pH (6.3), TDS (410.7 mg/l), EC (709.7), temperature (25.83 °C), turbidity (0.47 NTU), alkalinity (104.8 mg/l), salinity (910.0 mg/l), total hardness (348.15 mg/l), dissolved oxygen (DO) (2.35 ppm), chlorine (5.4 mg/l), fluoride (1.12 mg/l), nitrate (NO<inf>3</inf>) (44.52 mg/l) and nitrite (NO<inf>2</inf>) (4.05 mg/l) were measured using standard methods recommended by World Health Organization and the American Public Health Association. Besides, the mean value of total coliform bacteria, including fecal coliform, was found; (0.32) with standard deviation; (0.572) whereas, the mean value of Escherichia coli was found (0.3) with a standard deviation of (0.564). This study also finds the drinking water sources highly contaminated by fecal coliform bacteria, including Escherichia coli, which is the main reason for many waterborne diseases such as gastroenteritis, dysentery, and diarrhea. Additionally, residents of the area also reported some instances of viral hepatitis. Moreover, the significant variations among various water quality parameters were attributed to growing urbanization trends, nearby agricultural runoffs, lack of proper sewerage/solid waste disposal systems, and direct discharge of waste effluents containing human and animal fecal material. Hence, the need for adequate education on health hygiene and water treatment practices was highly recommended. Similarly, the execution of routine drinking water quality monitoring by relevant organizations was considered indispensable."

The study was carried out over a three-year period (2013–2015) in the San Roque Dam, Córdoba, Argentina. The overall frequency detection was 62.9% for PBV, 64.2% for HAdV and 70.4% for iEV. No significant differences were observed in the rates of detection for any of these viruses through the years studied, and a seasonal pattern was not present. Whenever there was RVA detection in the samples analyzed, there was also detection of iEV and/or HAdV and/or PBV. At least one of the viral groups analyzed was demonstrated in the 100% of the samples with faecal coliforms values within the guideline limits. In this setting, especially in those samples which reveal faecal indicator bacteria within the guideline limit, we propose to carry out a pathway, involving PBV, HAdV and iEV detection in order to enhance the evaluation of microbiological quality in freshwater in Argentina. The proposed methodological strategy could report faecal contamination in water, mainly of human origin, and the condition of the matrix to maintain viral viability. In addition, the viral groups selected could report the presence of RV."

Worldwide, countries im-posed stringent mass quarantine and lockdowns to curb the transmission of the pathogen. While the efficacy of such lockdown is debatable, several reports suggest that the reduced human activities provided an inadvertent benefit by briefly improving air and water quality. India observed a 68-days long, nation-wide, stringent lockdown between 24 March and 31 May 2020. Here, we delineate the impact of the lockdown on groundwater and river sourced drinking water sustainability in the arsenic polluted Ganges river basin of India, which is regarded as one of the largest and most polluted river basins in the world. Using groundwater arsenic measurements from drinking water wells and water quality data from river monitoring stations, we have studied ~700 km stretches of the middle and lower reaches of the As (arsenic)-polluted parts of the river for pre-lockdown (Jan-uary-March 2020), syn-lockdown (April-May), and post-lockdown periods (June-July). We provide the extent of As pollution-free groundwater vis-à-vis river water and examine alleviation from lock-down as an opportunity for sustainable drinking water sources. The overall decrease of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations and increase of pH suggests a general improvement in Ganges water quality during the lockdown in contrast to pre-and-post lockdown periods, potentially caused by reduced effluent. We also demonstrate that land use (agricultural/industrial) and land cover (urban-periurban/rural) in the vicinity of the river reaches seems to have a strong influence on river pollutants. The observations provide a cautious optimistic scenario for potentially developing sustainable drinking water sources in the arsenic-affected Ganges river basin in the future by using these observations as the basis of proper scientif-ically prudent, spatially adaptive strategies, and technological interventions."

Like other countries, Thailand faces fecal slugde management (FSM) problems leading to significant fecal pathogen infections, especially in the north and northeastern regions. This study assessed the effects of unsafely-managed FS on human health risks in two cities, Natan City and Tham Lod City in Thailand, that have relatively high liver fluke and diarrhea infections, and identified the factors relating to FSM practices that affect the prevalence of liver fluke and diarrhea infections due to FS. Specific measures were proposed in delivering integrated FSM solutions and health risk protection toward the Sustainable Development Goal No. 6 (SDG6) targets of safely managed sanitation and hygiene services. Based on data collected from these cities from February to May 2019, factors relating to FSM practices that affect the prevalence of liver fluke and diarrhea infections were identified and analysed using multiple regression analysis. Based on the findings, specific measures in delivering integrated FSM solutions and health risk protection toward the Sustainable Development Goals 6 (SDG 6) are proposed. Because no FS treatment facilities operate in Natan City and Tham Lod City, almost 100% of FS is discharged directly into open drains, resulting in diarrhea and liver fluke infections among local people. The findings identified the factors relating to FSM practices that affect the prevalence of liver fluke and diarrhea infections and proposed specific measures in delivering integrated FSM solutions and health risk protection, such as promoting education programmes, avoiding direct FS discharges into open drains and nearby streams, and providing innovative FSM technologies to eradicate fecal pathogen infections."

Cats may be at risk of water contamination from feces due to poor sanitation and hygiene. The objectives of the present study were to (1) evaluate the prevalence of coliform bacteria in cat drinking water and (2) identify possible risk factors leading to contamination. Materials and Methods: Fifty-five drinking water samples were collected from water containers used by cats (median age [range]: 5 years [8 months-15 years]) at their home. Using a sterile syringe, 50 mL water was collected directly from water containers. The water samples were stored in coliform enhancement media for 24 h and then submitted for bacterial culture. Results: The prevalence of fecal coliform contamination of cat drinking water was 67.27% (37/55; 95% confidence interval: 53.29-79.32%). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of coliform bacterial contamination of drinking water by age or gender of the cat or by water container type. However, bacterial contamination differed significantly between shorthaired cats and longhaired cats when comparing Escherichia coli (9/44 [20.45%] vs. 8/11 [72.72%], p<0.001) and Enterobacter spp. (16/44 [36.36%] vs. 9/11 [81.82%], p=0.007). For water that had been in a container longer than 12 h, there were significantly more contaminated tap water samples (16/19 [84.21%]) than contaminated processed water samples (9/17 [52.94%], p=0.047). Conclusion: Coliform contamination in cat drinking water is common and occurs more often in households with longhaired cats. Drinking water for cats should be changed every 12 h, especially for households using tap water."

We then applied the commonly used statistical methods from the review on publicly available datasets to illustrate how data analysis methods affect FIB results and interpretation. Our findings indicate that standard methods for processing samples are not widely reported, the selection of statistical tests is rarely justified, and, depending on the application, statistical methods can change risk perception and present misleading results. These results raise concerns about the validity of FIB data collection, analysis, and presentation in LMICs.

A total of 12 water samples were collected from different localities of study area to analyze for various physicochemical and biological parameters i.e. namely temperature, pH, turbidity, color, odor, taste, electric conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness (Calcium + Magnesium), chloride, arsenic, phosphate, lead, ammonium ion, nitrite, Fecal coliform and Escherichia coli. Results exposed that all ground water samples of study area were grossly contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms like E. coli and Fecal coliform except one water sample that was obtained from community filter plant Samahni Chowk site. Besides it, values of some physicochemical water quality determining parameters also deviated from recommended limits of World Health Organization (WHO). Chloride ion concentration was little below the prescribed limits in almost all water samples. It has been proven that consumption of un-safe drinking water is one of the major cause of prevalence of water borne diseases like diarrhea, gastroenteritis, typhoid fever and malaria etc. in study area. Community water supply and sanitation projects should be encouraged; government should provide filter plants in all regions of the country so that people could have easy approach to safe drinking water."
"Seasonal and spatial occurrence of zoonotic Salmonella serotypes in griffon vultures at farmland environments: Implications in pathogen pollution and ecosystem services and disservices","G., Blanco, Guillermo; J.A., Díaz de Tuesta, Juan A.","Science of the Total Environment","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143681","758",NA,"2021","Livestock production is a large source of microbial, pharmaceutical, and antimicrobial pollution worldwide. Vultures are one group of birds with particularly high exposure to food-borne pathogens due to frequent consumption of infected livestock carcasses. The potential origin and spatial-temporal shedding patterns of livestock-adapted Salmonella serotypes of zoonotic importance were evaluated in adult and nestling Griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus). We specifically assessed the exposure source and subsequent elimination of Salmonella-infected carcasses (ecosystem services) or transmission back to livestock (ecosystem disservices) by vultures, thus contributing respectively to disease mitigation or amplification in natural and farmed environments. The results show a seasonal high occurrence and turnover of a high variety of serotypes, especially swine-adapted ones isolated at high frequency. This suggests that vultures can be reservoirs and long-distance carriers of faecal Salmonella shed in supplementary feeding stations and breeding colonies. Contrary to their conservation purposes, feeding stations can act as Salmonella hotspots and reservoirs. However, a role for vultures in the transmission back to food-producing animals seems impossible because they do not come into contact at indoor farms, while transmission to free-ranging ruminants was not supported by the presence of ruminant-adapted serotypes in the vultures. Therefore, vultures do not promote disservices associated with the re-infection of livestock with Salmonella, but can provide quantitatively important ecosystem services by removing carrion contaminated with these and other zoonotic pathogens potentially affecting their health. Sanitary vigilance of the farms authorised to provide food for avian scavengers should avoid the disposal of swine and poultry carcasses with Salmonella and the antibiotics used to treat it. Extensive free-ranging livestock and their carcasses exploited in the countryside should be a priority for the conservation of vultures and their ecological function as cleaners and disease mitigators."

Oysters as bivalves, bio accumulate pathogens from the water through filter feeding and are suspected to play a role as disease transmission vector. In Malaysia, the data on oyster’s microbiological quality are limited. Hence, it was vital to conduct oyster related studies in Malaysia. The main objectives of this study include the enumeration of most probable number (MPN) of fecal coliforms and E. coli and isolation of E. coli from oyster (Crassostrea iredalei) and water sample for the detection of 16S rRNA and HlyA (Hemolysin A) genes of E. coli O157:H7. Methodology and results: A total of 120 oysters and water samples (n=6) were collected from a fisherman village located in southern Malaysia. Total fecal coliforms and E. coli were determined using the MPN procedure. Colonies of E. coli were identified based on Gram staining, biochemical test, and PCR detection for the presence of 16S rRNA and HlyA gene of E. coli O157:H7. The enumeration results showed that the MPN of the fecal coliforms and E. coli found in the collected oyster samples do not meet the standard to be directed for human consumption (0.72 ± 0.19 × 104 MPN/100 g and 0.13 ± 0.03 × 104 MPN/100 g, respectively). The PCR assays showed that 16 out of the 104 (15.38%) of E. coli isolated from water and oysters showed the presence of HlyA gene. The phylogenetic tree analysis showed there were genetic relationships between the HlyA gene of the E. coli isolated in this study with the ones isolated from calf and human faeces. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: The detection of Shiga toxin producing E. coli O157:H7 (HlyA gene) in cage cultured oysters (C. iredalei) and water from southern Malaysia was first time reported here. In the future, more study can be conducted to study the expression of the HlyA gene and confirm of its identity as E. coli O157:H7 using different target genes such as eaeA (encodes a 94 kD outer membrane protein called intimin) and Stx1 (Shiga toxin, Shigella dysenteriae type 1)."

One hundred and twenty water samples were collected from four sampling sites (the source, reservoir, taps, and households’ containers) from February to April 2020. Total and fecal coliforms were counted from the water samples using membrane filtration while selected physicochemical parameters were determined using standard methods. The mean counts of total and fecal coliforms ranged from 3.9 to 22.9 and 1 to 13.6 CFU/100 mL, respectively. Hence, all water samples did not satisfy the WHO guidelines and national standards. There were statistically significant differences in the coliform counts between the different sampling sites, and the counts were significantly higher in the taps and households’ containers compared to the counts in the source and reservoir ( p < 0.05). All physicochemical parameters, except for temperature, were within the recommended acceptable limits. High coliform count in the water system demands proper maintenance of the distribution line and good hygiene practices at household level to improve the microbiological quality of drinking water in Kobo town."

High rates of campylobacteriosis were observed during the study period (≥115 cases/100 K). Infections occurred throughout the year, with peaks in late summer and early autumn. Most infections occurred in people living in Lethbridge. Campylobacter jejuni was not isolated from municipal drinking water. In contrast, the bacterium was isolated from untreated and treated wastewater and river water (all sites). There were no correlations between C. jejuni recovery/detection from water and river flow rates, water turbidity, or fecal coliforms. Campylobacter jejuni recovery from water did not correspond to the peak periods of campylobacteriosis. The bacterium was most commonly isolated downstream of wastewater outfalls; waterfowl congregated at these sites, particularly during the winter months. A comparison of C. jejuni isolates from people and water revealed that most subtypes in water did not correspond to subtypes recovered from diarrheic people and were linked to waterfowl and other non-human animal sources. We conclude that waterborne C. jejuni did not contribute significantly to the high rates of campylobacteriosis observed in diarrheic people during the study period."

Hepatitis E virus infection is an emerging disease with varied courses in pregnancy. There is a dearth of statistics among pregnant women. Aim. To evaluate the prevalence, associated factors, and pregnancy outcome in women that tested positive for hepatitis E virus (HEV) antibodies in pregnancy. Research Methods. This was a cross-sectional study conducted among pregnant women at a teaching hospital in Nigeria. Relevant information was collected using a structured questionnaire. Blood was collected from each of the participants, and the serum was used to determine the presence of hepatitis E immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG). The data were analysed using SPSS version 23. Associations between variables were determined at a p value of <0.05. Results. A total of 200 pregnant women participated in this study. The prevalence of HEV infection among pregnant women was 28.00% (56/200). The mean age was 30.11 ± 5.88. Hepatitis E infection was significantly associated with age (p value = 0.028), method of faecal disposal (p value = 0.043), and source of drinking water (p value = 0.039). A total of 9/200 (4.50%) stillbirths were recorded with 3/9 (33.33%) in women that tested positive for HEV antibodies. About 4/200(2.00%) miscarriages were recorded, and 2/4 (50.00%) were in women that tested positive for HEV antibodies. Hepatitis E infection was not significantly associated with perinatal outcome (p value = 0.45).

In this experimental study a synthetic solution was made by adding effluent to distilled water. In each run, the nano silver (20-100 μg /L) and ZnO NPs (0.25-2 mg/L) were added to contaminated water. The samples were tested by 15-tube series method based on the instruction 9221-B of 21th edition of standard method book on water and wastewater experiments. Bacteria removal efficiency were examined in contact times (15, 30,60, 90 and 120) minutes. Our data indicate a decrease in the number of bacteria (MPN) in the presence of the nanoparticles. Results revealed that the removal percentage of coliform bacteria removal increased with increasing the contact time and concentrations of nanoparticles. Ag NPs at a concentration of 100 μg /L and ZnO NPs at a concentration of 2 mg/L showed the highest percentage of removal bacteria and the combination of ZnO and Ag NPs have been high synergistic behavior against coliform bacteria in contaminated water. therefore, using a combination of ZnO and Ag NPs can become a new and efficient method for the removal of indicator bacteria from contaminated water."

On July 13, 2016, an ADD outbreak was reported from Sawargaon village from Nagpur district, Maharashtra. Objective: The outbreak was investigated to describe the epidemiology and suggest control and preventive measures. Methods: A case was defined as a person experiencing at least one loose stool in Sawargaon village between July 9, 2016, and July 31, 2016. We searched for cases by enhanced passive surveillance. We collected stool samples for bacterial culture and tested water from multiple water sources for fecal coliforms. We also reviewed sanitary practices and rainfall data. Results: A total of 889 cases were identified, with 51% female, 280 hospitalizations (31%), and two deaths. The median age was 27 years (range 6 months to 90 years). Cases started on July 9, a week after heavy rains. District authorities started chlorination of water sources on July 13 and cases declined soon after. Two of nine stool samples tested positive for Vibrio cholera O1 serogroup. Of the 18 water samples collected, 16 (88%) samples from multiple sources, including wells, hand pumps, and taps, were positive for fecal coliforms. Of 1,885 households in the village, 450 (24%) households had no toilets and open defecation was commonly observed in the nearby river bed. Conclusions: This ADD outbreak was likely associated with drinking contaminated groundwater, which probably occurred after heavy rainfall in an area of open defecation. We recommended providing chlorinated drinking water, promoting safe sanitation practices, including building more public and private toilets, and enhancing diagnostic laboratory capacity."

Water samples from protected and unprotected springs, hand-dug well, taps, and households' containers were collected from November 2018 to June 2019 for bacteriological and physicochemical analyses. Besides, information about the potential risk factors was collected using a structured questionnaire. A total of 120 water samples were collected and analyzed for total and fecal coliform counts using the multiple tube fermentation method (MPN). The presence of Escherichia coli was also checked from fecal coliform positive samples collected from households' containers. Selected physicochemical parameters were also determined using the standard methods. In all cases, the median values of total and fecal coliform counts ranged from 5 to 27 and 2 to 13 MPN/100 ml, respectively. Accordingly, all of the drinking water samples did not comply with the standards. Coliforms were significantly higher in the households' containers than in the sources (p<0.05) and also significantly varied by water sources. The highest and lowest coliform counts were recorded in unprotected spring and taps, respectively. Besides, 18.33% of water samples collected from households' containers were tested positive for E. coli. Regarding physicochemical parameters, most values were within the acceptable limit values recommended by the WHO. However, water samples from unprotected spring and hand-dug well did not satisfy the turbidity limit value set by the WHO. Drinking water systems in Wegeda town were likely contaminated with pathogenic bacteria likely due to poor protection and sanitation practices. Providing the community with potable water, toilets, domestic and animal waste disposal systems, and intensive health education and sanitation practices for the community are highly recommended."

As a noted waterborne disease, emphasis has been given to the study VTEC in surface waters, readily susceptible to microbial contamination. Conversely, the status of VTEC in potable groundwater sources, generally regarded as a “safe” drinking-water supply remains largely understudied. As such, this investigation presents the first scoping review seeking to determine the global prevalence of VTEC in groundwater supply sources intended for human consumption. Twenty-three peer-reviewed studies were identified and included for data extraction. Groundwater sample and supply detection rates (estimated 0.6 and 1.3%, respectively) indicate VTEC is infrequently present in domestic groundwater sources. However, where generic (fecal indicator) E. coli are present, the VTEC to E. coli ratio was found to be 9.9%, representing a latent health concern for groundwater consumers. Geographically, extracted data indicates higher VTEC detection rates in urban (5.4%) and peri‑urban (4.9%) environments than in rural areas (0.9%); however, this finding is confounded by the predominance of research studies in lower income regions. Climate trends indicate local environments classified as ‘temperate’ (14/554; 2.5%) and ‘cold’ (8/392; 2%) accounted for a majority of supply sources with VTEC present, with similar detection rates encountered among supplies sampled during periods typically characterized by ‘high’ precipitation (15/649; 2.3%). Proposed prevalence figures may find application in preventive risk-based catchment and groundwater quality management including development of Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessments (QMRA). Notwithstanding, to an extent, a large geographical disparity in available investigations, lack of standardized reporting, and bias in source selection, restrict the transferability of research findings. Overall, the mechanisms responsible for VTEC transport and ingress into groundwater supplies remain ambiguous, representing a critical knowledge gap, and denoting a distinctive lack of integration between hydrogeological and public health research. Key recommendations and guidelines are provided for prospective studies directed at increasingly integrative and multi-disciplinary research."

Denene; R.T., Noble, Rachel T.","Science of the Total Environment","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141124","747",NA,"2020","Fecal contamination is observed downstream of municipal separate storm sewer systems in coastal North Carolina. While it is well accepted that wet weather contributes to this phenomenon, less is understood about the contribution of the complex hydrology in this low-lying coastal plain. A quantitative microbial assessment was conducted in Beaufort, North Carolina to identify trends and potential sources of fecal contamination in stormwater receiving waters. Fecal indicator concentrations were significantly higher in receiving water downstream of a tidally submerged outfall compared to an outfall that was permanently submerged (p < 0.001), though tidal height was not predictive of human-specific microbial source tracking (MST) marker concentrations at the tidally submerged site. Short-term rainfall (i.e. <12 h) was predictive of E. coli, Enterococcus spp., and human-specific MST marker concentrations (Fecal Bacteroides, BacHum, and HF183) in receiving waters. The strong correlation between 12-hr antecedent rainfall and Enterococcus spp. (r = 0.57, p < 0.001, n = 92) suggests a predictive model could be developed based on rainfall to communicate risk for bathers. Additional molecular marker data indicates that the delivery of fecal sources is complex and highly variable, likely due to the influence of tidal influx (saltwater intrusion from the estuary) into the low-lying stormwater pipes. In particular, elevated MST marker concentrations (up to 2.56 × 104 gene copies HF183/mL) were observed in standing water near surcharging street storm drain. These data are being used to establish a baseline for stormwater dynamics prior to dramatic rainfall in 2018 and to characterize the interaction between complex stormwater dynamics and water quality impairment in coastal NC."

Disease clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to severe multiple organ damage. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular receptor, which is abundantly expressed in the small intestine, allowing viral replication in the gastrointestinal tract. Viral RNA has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients and viable viruses had been isolated in some of these samples. Thus, a putative role of SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission has been argued. SARS-CoV-2 is shed in human excreta and further disposed in the sewerage or in the environment, in poor basic sanitation settings. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable population level approach for monitoring viral pathogens and has been successfully used in different contexts. This review summarizes the current global experience on SARS-CoV-2 WBE in distinct continents and viral detection in polluted surface water. The advantages and concerns of this strategy for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance are discussed. Outcomes suggest that WBE is a valuable early warning alert and a helpful complementary surveillance tool to subside public health response, to tailor containment and mitigation measures and to determine target populations for testing. In poor sanitation settings, contaminated rivers could be alternatively used as a source for environmental surveillance."

We investigated to determine the outbreak scope and risk factors for transmission, and recommend evidence-based control measures. Methods: We defined a suspected case as sudden onset of watery diarrhoea in any person aged ≥ 2 years in Hoima District, 1 February–9 May 2018. A confirmed case was a suspected case with Vibrio cholerae cultured from a stool sample. We found cases by active community search and record reviews at Cholera Treatment Centres. We calculated case-fatality rates (CFR) and attack rates (AR) by sub-county and nationality. In a case-control study, we compared exposure factors among case- and control-households. We estimated the association between the exposures and outcome using Mantel-Haenszel method. We conducted an environmental assessment in the refugee settlement, including testing samples of stream water, tank water, and spring water for presence of fecal coliforms. We tested suspected cholera cases using cholera rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kits followed by culture for confirmation. Results: We identified 2122 case-patients and 44 deaths (CFR = 2.1%). Case-patients originating from Demographic Republic of Congo were the most affected (AR = 15/1000). The overall attack rate in Hoima District was 3.2/1000, with Kyangwali sub-county being the most affected (AR = 13/1000). The outbreak lasted 4 months, which was a multiple point-source. Environmental assessment showed that a stream separating two villages in Kyangwali Refugee Settlement was a site of open defecation for refugees. Among three water sources tested, only stream water was feacally-contaminated, yielding > 100 CFU/100 ml. Of 130 stool samples tested, 124 (95%) yielded V. cholerae by culture. Stream water was most strongly associated with illness (odds ratio [OR] = 14.2, 95% CI: 1.5–133), although tank water also appeared to be independently associated with illness (OR = 11.6, 95% CI: 1.4–94). Persons who drank tank and stream water had a 17-fold higher odds of illness compared with persons who drank from other sources (OR = 17.3, 95% CI: 2.2–137). Conclusions: Our investigation demonstrated that this was a prolonged cholera outbreak that affected four sub-counties and two divisions in Hoima District, and was associated with drinking of contaminated stream water. In addition, tank water also appears to be unsafe. We recommended boiling drinking water, increasing latrine coverage, and provision of safe water by the District and entire High Commission for refugees."
"Some respite for India's dirtiest river? Examining the Yamuna's water quality at Delhi during the COVID-19 lockdown period","P.P., Patel, Priyank Pravin; S., Mondal, Sayoni; K.G., Ghosh, Krishna Gopal","Science of the Total Environment","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140851","744",NA,"2020","The Yamuna's stretch within Delhi is considered as the dirtiest river reach in India and despite numerous restoration plans, pollution levels have risen unabated. However, the enforcement of a nationwide lockdown due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic can possibly provide a ray of hope. We analyze the lockdown's impact on the water quality status of this stretch using a combination of measured parameters and satellite image derived indices. Class C Water Quality Index estimates of nine stations indicate an improvement of 37% during the lockdown period. The Biological Oxygen Demand and Chemical Oxygen Demand values reduced by 42.83% and 39.25%, respectively, compared to the pre-lockdown phase, while Faecal Coliform declined by over 40%. Similar analysis of 20 major drains that meet the Yamuna revealed declining effluent loads and discernable improvements in drain contaminant status were ascertained via a hierarchical cluster analysis. Reach-wise suspended particulate matter content, turbidity and algal signatures were derived from multi-temporal Landsat-8 images of prior and ongoing lockdown periods for 117 channel segment zones. These parameters also declined notably within most stretches, although their extents were spatially varied. While the partial/non-operational status of most industries during the lockdown enabled significant reduction in effluent loads and a consequent betterment in the river water quality, its spatial variations and even deterioration in some locations resulted from the largely undiminished inflow of domestic sewage through multiple drains. This study provides an estimate of possible river recovery extents and degree of improvement if deleterious polluting activities and contaminants are regulated properly."

UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 aims to address this issue. Tryptophan-like fluorescence (TLF) shows potential as a rapid method for detecting microbial contamination in drinking water, which could reduce the spread of waterborne diseases. This study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of TLF for a large-scale survey using a randomised, spot-sampling approach. The large-scale survey took place in Malawi, sub-Saharan Africa, in the dry season (n = 183). A subset of sources were revisited at the end of the following wet season (n = 41). The effectiveness of TLF was assessed by comparing TLF results to thermotolerant coliforms (TTC), humic-like fluorescence (HLF), inorganic hydrochemical data and sanitary risk scores. The most prominent differences in microbial water quality were observed between source types, with little variation between districts and seasons. TLF, TTCs, turbidity and sanitary risk scores were all elevated at alternative sources (shallow wells and tap stands) compared to hand-pumped boreholes. In the dry season, 18% of hand-pumped boreholes showed TTC contamination, which increase to 21% in the wet season. Groundwater recharge processes are likely responsible for seasonal variability of inorganic hydrochemistry at hand-pumped boreholes. TLF was able to distinguish no and low WHO risk classes (TTC 0–9 cfu/100 mL) from medium, high and very high risk classes (TTC 10 – >1000 cfu/100 mL). TLF failed to distinguish between no and low risk classes, which limits the use of TLF for assessing water quality to drinking water standards. This dataset indicates that HLF may raise baseline TLF for samples with low TLF values, increasing false positives. Therefore, TLF is better suited as a rapid high-level water quality screening tool to assess moderate and high levels of faecal contamination."

The samples were evaluated for total coliform (TC), faecal coliform (FC) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Sanitary inspections of the surroundings of the GO-installed dug wells identified the sources of faecal contamination. Both the GO-installed and NGO-installed dug wells had bacterial contamination. The median concentrations of E. coli among the GO-installed and NGO-installed dug wells were, respectively, 41 and 21 cfu/100 ml in the wet season, and respectively 2 and <1 cfu/100 ml in the dry season. In the wet season, 24 and 31%, respectively, of the GO-installed and NGO-installed dug wells were in the high-risk category. All of the dug wells had higher disease burden in the wet season compared to the dry season. The findings suggest that drinking water from the dug wells is likely to pose health risks to the rural communities."
"Innovative multistage constructed wetland for municipal wastewater treatment and reuse for agriculture in Senegal","A., Torrens, Antonina; D., de la Varga, David; A.K., Ndiaye, Abdou Khafor; M., Folch, M.; A., Coly, Adrien","Water (Switzerland)","10.3390/w12113139","12","11","2020","This paper reports on the performance of using a multistage constructed wetland (CW) to treat municipal raw wastewater and an analysis of its suitability for agricultural irrigation. The pilot plant consists of two stages of vertical flow CWs plus one stage of a horizontal CW built in 2018 with different local materials at the Gaston Berger University Campus, Saint Louis (Senegal). Each CW stage is composed of several filters with different type of media (silex, granite, or river gravel), filtering media depths, and macrophytes (Phragmites and Typha). The physicochemical and microbiological indicators were monitored over six months at each bed inlet and outlet to evaluate the efficiency and achievements of the Senegalese, European, and WHO regulations/recommendations for disposal or reuse in irrigation. This study demonstrates the viability of this new multistage CW design to treat raw municipal wastewater and produce an effluent of good quality suitable for reuse in agriculture. The removal of organic matter, suspended solids, and nutrients was very high (>95% for SS, BOD<inf>5</inf> and N-NH<inf>4</inf>+, >90% for COD and P-PO<inf>4</inf>3−), as was the reduction of microbiological indicators (fecal coliform reduction >5 log units and helminth egg removal of 100%). First, trends related to the influence of design (the type of gravel, filter depth, and type of macrophyte), operational modes, and the CW treatment efficiency were determined. The use of non-crushed gravel and Typha spp. seemed to provide better removal rates. On the contrary, no differences were found between the use of silex or granite gravel. For the studied Senegalese conditions under dry and hot climates, the preliminary results indicate that no resting periods are necessary for vertical flow CWs (VFCWs), thus resulting in a reduction in construction and operation costs. The main outcome of our study is evidence that multistage CWs can provide robust, cost-effective treatments, as well as allow for safe water reuse, which is imperative in areas with severe water scarcity and endemic microbiological waterborne diseases."

We hereby present the imprints of lockdown on water quality (both chemical and biological) parameters during the nationwide lockdown (COVID-19 epidemic) in India between 25th March to 30th May 2020. The present study describes the changes in chemical and biological water quality parameters based on twenty-two groundwater samples from the coastal industrial city of Tuticorin in Southern India, taken before (10 and 11th February 2020) and during the lockdown (19 and 20th April 2020) periods. The physico-chemical parameters compared are pH, total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC), nitrate (NO<inf>3</inf>), fluoride (F), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and selenium (Se), and the bacterial parameters are total coliforms, fecal coliforms, E. coli, and fecal streptococci. Among the metals, the significant reductions in Se (42%), As (51%), Fe (60%) and Pb (50%) were noticed probably owing to no or very less wastewater discharges from metal-based industries, seafood-based industries and thermal power plants during the lockdown. Reduction in NO<inf>3</inf> (56%), total coliform (52%) and fecal coliforms (48%) indicated less organic sewage from the fishing industries. Contents of Cr, Cu, Zn and Cd, however, remained similar and fluoride did not show any change, probably as they were sourced from rock-water interactions. Similarly, we did not observe alterations in E. coli and fecal streptococci due to no significant change in domestic sewage production during the lockdown. The multivariate analyses aptly illustrated this and the principal component analyses helped to identify the sources that controlled water qualities of the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown period. Our observation implies that groundwater is definitely under active interaction with surface waters and thus a quick revival could be observed following the seizing of anthropogenic activities."

On 10 May 2018, staff at the north Delhi district surveillance unit identified a laboratory-confirmed cholera outbreak when five people tested positive for Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa serotype in Bhadola. We investigated to identify risk factors and recommend prevention measures. Methods:We defined a case as ≥3 loose stools within 24 h in a Bhadola resident during 1 April-29 May 2018. We searched for cases house-to-house. In a 1 : 1 unmatched case control study, a controlwas defined as an absence of loose stools in a Bhadola resident during 1 April-29 May 2018. We selected cases and controls randomly. We tested stool samples for Vibrio cholerae by culture. We tested drinking water for fecal contamination. Using multivariable logistic regression we calculated adjusted ORs (aORs) with 95% CIs. Results: We identified 129 cases; the median age was 14.5 y, 52% were females, 27% were hospitalized and there were no deaths. Symptoms were abdominal pain (54%), vomiting (44%) and fever (29%). Among 90 cases and controls, the odds of illness were higher for drinking untreated municipal water (aOR=2.3; 95% CI 1.0 to 6.2) and not knowing about diarrhea transmission (aOR=4.9; 95% CI 1.0 to 21.1). Of 12 stool samples, 6 (50%) tested positive for Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa serotype. Of 15 water samples, 8 (53%) showed growth of fecal coliforms. Conclusions: This laboratory-confirmed cholera outbreak associated with drinking untreated municipal water and lack of knowledge of diarrhea transmission triggered public health action in Bhadola, Delhi."

Nutrient enrichment from agricultural pollution increases disease pressure in many host-pathogen systems, but the mechanisms underlying this pattern are not always resolved. For example, nutrient enrichment should strongly influence pools of aquatic environmental bacteria, which has the potential to alter microbiome composition of aquatic animals and their vulnerability to disease. However, shifts in the host microbiome have received little attention as a link between nutrient enrichment and diseases of aquatic organisms. We examined nutrient enrichment through the widespread practice of integrated pig-fish farming and its effects on microbiome composition of Brazilian amphibians and prevalence of the globally distributed amphibian skin pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). This farming system drove surges in fecal coliform bacteria, disturbing amphibian skin bacterial communities such that hosts recruited higher proportions of Bd-facilitative bacteria and carried higher Bd prevalence. Our results highlight previously overlooked connections between global trends in land use change, microbiome dysbiosis, and wildlife disease. These interactions may be particularly important for disease management in the tropics, a region with both high biodiversity and continually intensifying anthropogenic pressures on aquatic wildlife habitats."

However, much of the world's population lacks access to adequate and safe water. Approximately 884,000, 000 people in the world still do not get their drinking water from safe sources; Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for over one third of this number. It is estimated that 80% of all illnesses in the world are related to use of unsafe and contaminated water. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from August 1st 2017 to July 30th 2018 in three randomly selected woreda (districts) of Eastern Zone Tigrai. Water samples were examined for total coliforms and thermotelorant coliforms using the most probable number method. Standard biochemical testing was performed on samples that tested positive to identify the genus of bacteria. The contaminant risk of water sources were assessed using the sanitary inspection checklist of the World Health Organization. The results were interpreted using World Health Organization guidelines for drinking water quality. Data was collected using laboratory checklist and sanitary inspection check list. It was entered, cleared and analyzed using SPSS version 21.0 and a variable having a P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant in all tests. Results: A total of 290 drinking water samples were analyzed for bacteriological quality. A total of 32.4% (n = 94) of water sources showed contamination with faecal and total coliforms. Of these 3.4% (n = 10) samples were contaminated with total coliforms and 29% (n = 84) contaminated with faecal coliforms. The leading water contaminant organisms were Escherichia coli (62.4%), Legionella species (8.5%), and Shigella species (7.5%) respectively. Based on WHO criteria, 15% of water sources were grouped in the very high risk group. Animal excreta and inadequate fencing of water sources were significantly associated with water contamination rate. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that most water sources in woredas of Eastern Tigrai are contaminated by faecal coliforms. Therefore, regular sanitary inspection, bacteriological analysis, and adequate fencing should be mandatory to protect drinking water sources from faecal contamination."

Tested parameters included pH, turbidity, temperature, fluoride concentration levels, and bacterial counts (faecal coliforms). Inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation in geographic information systems (GIS) was used for spatial analysis. Test results revealed that 48% of water samples had faecal coliforms count (per 100 mL) greater than World Health Organization (WHO) minimum limits, while 31% of samples had fluoride concentrations in excess of the WHO maximum guide values. Spatial distribution mapping was developed for faecal coliforms count and fluoride ion concentration using ArcGIS to highlight the high-risk settlements in the study area. Results showed that around 20% area under faecal coliforms and approximately 33% area based on fluoride concentrations fall under the need for treatment category. The pH and turbidity were found in compliance with WHO desirable limits. The sanitary inspection score significantly depicted that ineffective multi-barrier approaches consequently deteriorated the water quality at the consumer's end. Findings from the present study shall be useful to policymakers for adopting necessary remedial measures before it severely affects public health."

We evaluated three different source water chlorination programs (bucket, in-line, and piped water chlorination) in the ongoing humanitarian response in Cox's Bazar refugee camps in Bangladesh. We used a mixed-methods research protocol including key informant interviews, water point observations, focus group discussions, household surveys, and water quality testing. The three evaluated programs were implemented at different response stages and required different levels of staffing, infrastructure, and community mobilization work. In the bucket chlorination program, highly contaminated open well water was chlorinated, in in-line and piped water chlorination programs, groundwater was treated. Overall, 71% of bucket, 36% of in-line, and 60% of piped water chlorination households had stored water that met free chlorine residual (FCR) criteria, respectively. Additionally, 71% of bucket, 86% of in-line, and 91% of piped water chlorination households had stored water that met Escherichia coli (E. coli) criteria (<10 E. coli CFU/100 mL). Regression results indicate presence of FCR, serving water by pouring, and higher source water pH were associated with meeting E. coli criteria. Our results highlight: no individual program fully met international standards as implemented, although each partially met standards; the importance of understanding beneficiary preferences and behavior change campaigns; and, the benefits and drawbacks of each source water chlorination program must be considered before implementation. Overall, we found appropriate source water chlorination program choice is a continuum, depending on humanitarian phase and context. Therefore, we recommend continuing context- and phase-appropriate source water chlorination programs, emphasizing consistent and acceptable chlorine dosage, implementing programmatic improvements, and incorporating user preferences to reduce microbial contamination and consequently the risk of waterborne diseases."

In this work we describe the occurrence of antibiotic resistant faecal coliforms and their mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in the effluent of two urban WWTPs in Ireland. This information is critical to identifying the role of WWTPs in the dissemination of ARB and ARGs into the environment. Effluent samples were collected from two WWTPs in Spring and Autumn of 2015 and 2016. The bacterial susceptibility patterns to 13 antibiotics were determined. The phenotypic tests were carried out to identify AmpC or extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers. The presence of ESBL genes were detected by PCR. Plasmids carrying ESBL genes were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α recipient and underwent plasmid replicon typing to identify incompatibility groups. More than 90% of isolated faecal coliforms were resistant to amoxicillin and ampicillin, followed by tetracycline (up to 39.82%), ciprofloxacin (up to 31.42%) and trimethoprim (up to 37.61%). Faecal coliforms resistant to colistin (up to 31.62%) and imipenem (up to 15.93%) were detected in all effluent samples. Up to 53.98% of isolated faecal coliforms expressed a multi-drug resistance (MRD) phenotype. AmpC production was confirmed in 5.22% of isolates. The ESBL genes were confirmed for 11.84% of isolates (9.2% of isolates carried bla<inf>TEM</inf>, 1.4% bla<inf>SHV-12</inf>, 0.2% bla<inf>CTX-M-1</inf> and 1% bla<inf>CTX-M-15</inf>). Plasmids extracted from 52 ESBL isolates were successfully transformed into recipient E. coli. The detected plasmid incompatibility groups included the IncF group, IncI1, IncHI1/2 and IncA/C. These results provide evidence that treated wastewater is polluted with ARB and MDR faecal coliforms and are sources of ESBL-producing, carbapenem and colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae."

Heightened incidence of waterborne disease outbreaks related to recreational use and source water contamination is associated with extreme rainfall events. Such extreme events are predicted to increase in some regions due to climate change. Consequently, municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) conveying pathogens to receiving waters are a growing public health concern. In addition, the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotic resistant bacteria in various environmental matrices, including urban runoff, is an emerging threat. The resistome and microbiota profile of MS4 discharges has yet to be fully characterized. To address this knowledge gap, we first analyzed the relationship between rainfall depth and intensity and E. coli densities (fecal indicator) in stormwater from four MS4 outflows in Columbus, Ohio, USA during the spring and summer of 2017. Microbial source tracking (MST) was conducted to examine major fecal contamination sources in the study sewersheds. A subset of samples was analyzed for microbial and resistome profiles using a metagenomic approach. The results showed a significant positive relationship between outflow E. coli density and rainfall intensity. MST results indicate prevalent fecal contamination from ruminant populations in the study sites (91% positive among the samples tested). Protobacteria and Actinobacteria were two dominant bacteria at a phylum level. A diverse array of ARGs and potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Salmonella enterica Typhimurium), fungi (e.g. Scedosporium apiospermum), and protists (e.g. Acanthamoeba palestinensis) were found in urban stormwater outflows that discharge into adjacent streams. The most prevalent ARGs among samples were β-lactam resistance genes and the most predominant virulence genes within bacterial community were related with Staphylococcus aureus. A comprehensive contamination profile indicates a need for sustainable strategies to manage urban stormwater runoff amid increasingly intense rainfall events to protect public and environmental health."
"Pathogen infection risk to recreational water users, associated with surface waters impacted by de facto and indirect potable reuse activities","S.E., Purnell, Sarah E.; A., Halliday, Andrew; F., Newman, Freya; C., Sinclair, Christine; J.E., Ebdon, James Edward","Science of the Total Environment","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137799","722",NA,"2020","Water deficit, exacerbated by global population increases and climate change, necessitates the investigation of alternative non-traditional water sources to augment existing supplies. Indirect potable reuse (IPR) represents a promising alternative water source in water-stressed regions. Of high concern is the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater, such as enteric viruses, protozoa and bacteria. Therefore, a greater understanding of the potential impact to human health is required. The aim of this research was to use a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) approach to calculate the probability of potential pathogen infection risk to the public in surface waters used for a range of recreational activities under scenarios: 1) existing de facto wastewater reuse conditions; 2) after augmentation with conventionally treated wastewater; and 3) after augmentation with reclaimed wastewater from proposed IPR schemes. Forty-four 31 l samples were collected from river sites and a coastal wastewater treatment works from July 2016–May 2017. Concentrations of faecal indicator organisms (enterococci, faecal coliforms, somatic coliphages and Bacteroides phages) determined using culture-based approaches and selected pathogens (adenovirus, Salmonella and Cryptosporidium) determined using molecular approaches (qPCR) were used to inform QMRA. The mean probability of infection from adenovirus under de facto conditions was high (>0.90) for all recreational activities, per single event. The risk of adenovirus and Cryptosporidium infection increased under augmentation scenario (2) (mean probability 0.95–1.00 and 0.01–0.06 per single event, respectively). Adenovirus and Cryptosporidium infection risk decreased under reclaimed water augmentation scenario (3) (mean probability <0.79, excluding swimming, which remained 1.00 and <0.01 per single event, respectively). Pathogen reduction after reclaimed water augmentation in surface waters impacted by de facto reuse, provides important evidence for alternative water supply option selection. As such, this evidence may inform water managers and the public of the potential benefits of IPR and improve acceptance of such practices in the future."
"Evaluation of CrAssphage Marker for Tracking Fecal Contamination in River Water in Nepal","L.M., Ward, Lauren M.; R., Ghaju Shrestha, Rajani; S., Tandukar, Sarmila; J.B., Sherchand, Jeevan Bahadur; E., Haramoto, Eiji; S.P., Sherchan, Samendra P.","Water, Air, and Soil Pollution","10.1007/s11270-020-04648-1","231","6","2020","Enteric viruses in the aquatic environment are a concern due to the potential for waterborne disease transmission to humans. In Nepal, the Bagmati River serves as a source of drinking and irrigation water; therefore, the detection of waterborne enteric pathogens is integral to maintaining human health. The objective of this study was to quantify the crAssphage marker in surface water samples from the Bagmati River between November 2015 and September 2016. Concentrations of crAssphage were then compared to those of other enteric viruses and indicator organisms found in the samples in order to examine the potential of crAssphage as a marker for fecal contamination. CrAssphage was detected in 17% (1/6) of samples from Sundarijal, 100% (6/6) of samples from Thapathali, and 100% (6/6) samples from Chovar, with the highest average concentrations recorded in May 2016 and the lowest average concentrations recorded in September 2016. Overall, crAssphage was present in 72% (13/18) of samples and was strongly correlated with the presence of fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli (r = 0.89) and Enterococcus (r = 0.92) and several enteric viruses. The strongest viral correlations were to salivirus (r = 0.84), pepper mild mottle virus (r = 0.77), Aichi virus 1 (r = 0.75), enteroviruses (r = 0.76), and tobacco mosaic virus (r = 0.71). These results provide evidence for the potential use of crAssphage as a marker for human fecal contamination in river water."

As a largely waterborne disease, emphasis has been given to the study of Cryptosporidium spp. in surface waters, readily susceptible to pathogenic contamination. Conversely, the status of Cryptosporidium in potable groundwater sources, generally regarded as a pristine and “safe” drinking-water supply owing to (sub)-soil protection, remains largely unknown. As such, this investigation presents the first literature review aimed to ascertain the global prevalence of Cryptosporidium in groundwater supply sources intended for human consumption. Thirty-seven peer-reviewed studies were identified and included in the review. Groundwater sample and supply detection rates (estimated 10–20%) indicate Cryptosporidium is frequently present in domestic groundwater sources, representing a latent health concern for groundwater consumers. Specifically, sample (10.4%) and source (19.1%) detection rates deriving from comprehensive “temporal” investigations are put forward as representative of a contamination ‘baseline’ for Cryptosporidium in ‘domestic’ groundwater supplies. Proposed ‘baseline’ prevalence figures are largely applicable in preventive risk-based catchment and groundwater quality management including the formulation of Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA). Notwithstanding, a large geographical disparity in available investigations and lack of standardized reporting restrict the transferability of research findings. Overall, the mechanisms responsible for Cryptosporidium transport and ingress into groundwater supplies remain ambiguous, representing a critical knowledge gap, and denoting a distinctive lack of integration between groundwater and public-health sub-disciplines among investigations. Key recommendations and guidelines are provided for prospective studies directed at more integrative and multi-disciplinary research."

The Plateau borough (city of Savè) in Benin faces problems of discontinuous access to drinking water due to its geographical location. This study focuses on the quality of drinking water available from source to final storage for domestic use. The Plateau borough has 23 hydraulic structures, 13 of which are non-functional and 10 functional (in good condition), and seven of these were the subject of our study (water sampling at the source for bacteriological analysis). Quantitative data processing was reinforced by documentary research, socio-anthropological surveys, qualitative data from field work, field analysis and laboratory bacteriological analysis on specimens collected during the study: water at the source, during transport, and storage. The sampling technique was divided into two parts: (a) choice of water points (type of structure); and (b) categories of actors submitted to the questionnaires. The results reveal that three types of hydraulic works serve as a source of drinking water for the population: Pumps with human propulsion; standpipes; and populations subscribed to the water distribution network of the Société Nationale des Eaux du Béni. Our analysis of 12 samples of water collected from pumps with human propulsion, standpipes and populations subscribed to the water distribution network found that 58.3% are drinkable and 41.6% are infected, and that links exist between water quality and poor human practices. The indices of infection of Escherichia coli and faecal coliform are all higher than the maximum value authorized by the World Health Organization, set at zero colony-forming units per 100 ml of water (0 CFU/100 ml). Many problems which are confronted in Africa, including Benin, are a consequence of water supply problems, and the results of this study may be useful in the development of policies that could help improve the well-being of communities. Recommendations are made on improving water quality management in Benin, including proposed actions for Municipal and Health Authorities."

Methods: we analyzed national cholera surveillance data to describe epidemiological patterns and carried out a case-control study to find reasons for the Nairobi county outbreak. Suspected cholera cases were Nairobi residents aged >2 years with acute watery diarrhea (>4 stools/≤12 hours) and illness onset 1-14 May 2015. Confirmed cases had Vibrio cholerae isolated from stool. Case-patients were frequency-matched to persons without diarrhea (1:2 by age group, residence), interviewed using standardized questionaires. Logistic regression identified factors associated with case status. Household water was analyzed for fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli. Results: during December 2014-June 2015, 4,218 cholera cases including 282 (6.7%) confirmed cases and 79 deaths (case-fatality rate [CFR] 1.9%) were reported from 14 of 47 Kenyan counties. Nairobi county reported 781 (19.0 %) cases (attack rate, 18/100,000 persons), including 607 (78%) hospitalisations, 20 deaths (CFR 2.6%) and 55 laboratory-confirmed cases (7.0%). Seven (70%) of 10 water samples from communal water points had coliforms; one had Escherichia coli. Factors associated with cholera in Nairobi were drinking untreated water (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-18.8), lacking health education (aOR 2.4, CI 1.1-7.9) and eating food outside home (aOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-5.7). Conclusion: we recommend safe water, health education, avoiding eating foods prepared outside home and improved sanitation in Nairobi county. Adherence to these practices could have prevented this protacted cholera outbreak."

TLF is an emerging indicator of water quality that is associated with members of the coliform group of bacteria and therefore potential fecal contamination. Following the demonstration of close correlation between TLF and E. coli in model waters and proof of principle with sensitivity of 4 CFU/mL for E. coli, we further developed a two-LED flow-through configuration capable of detecting TLF levels corresponding to ""high risk"" fecal contamination levels (>10 CFU/100 mL). Findings to date suggest that this device represents a scalable solution for remote monitoring of drinking water supplies to identify high-risk drinking water in near-time. Such information can be immediately actionable to reduce risks."

However, the variation in approaches taken for QMRA in relation to drinking water supply is not well understood. This systematic review identifies, categorises, and critically synthesises peer-reviewed and academic case studies of QMRA implementation for existing distributed public drinking water supplies. Thirty-nine English-language, peer-reviewed and academic studies published from 2003 to 2019 were identified. Key findings were synthesised in narrative form. The overall designs of the included studies varied widely, as did the assumptions used in risk calculation, especially in relation to pathogen dose. There was also substantial variation in the degree to which the use of location-specific data weighed with the use of assumptions when performing risk calculation. In general, the included studies’ complexity did not appear to be associated with greater result certainty. Factors relating to pathogen dose were commonly influential on risk estimates whereas dose-response parameters tended to be of low relative influence. In two of the included studies, use of the ‘susceptible fraction’ factor was inconsistent with recognised guidance and potentially led to the underestimation of risk. While approaches and assumptions used in QMRA need not be standardised, improvement in the reporting of QMRA results and uncertainties would be beneficial. It is recommended that future authors consider the water supply QMRA reporting checklist developed for the current review. Consideration of the broad types of uncertainty relevant to QMRA is also recommended. Policy-makers should consider emergent discussion on acute microbial health-based targets when setting normative guidelines. The continued representation of QMRA case studies within peer-reviewed and academic literature would also enhance future implementation. Further research is needed on the optimisation of QMRA resourcing given the application context."
"Applying Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment Model in Developing Appropriate Standards for Irrigation Water","S.M., Ezzat, Safaa M.","Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management","10.1002/ieam.4232","16","3","2020","This study aimed to apply a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) model to estimate the annual risk probability of Salmonella infection associated with the consumption of crops, which were irrigated with raw wastewater abstracted by farmers without official permission. Data generated from the model were used to propose realistic standards for Salmonella in irrigation water needed for safe crop production. Results demonstrated the presence of total coliforms, fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, and Salmonella in wastewater samples. Salmonella was recorded on lettuce and spinach in 3 different harvesting events, although it was not found in data obtained for parsley plant. The QMRA scenario included surface irrigation, consumption of raw crops, and 1-day withholding period before harvest. The annual risk probability of Salmonella infection for consumers exceeded the target tolerable risk (7.7 × 10−4) for investigated crops. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between different annual risk probabilities showed significant correlation (p < 0.05). The levels of risk posed from spinach and lettuce were roughly similar, although they tended to be higher for lettuce. The optimum concentrations of Salmonella in irrigation water needed to satisfy the World Health Organization guidelines of disease burden (disability-adjusted life years 10−6) per person per year ranged from 34 to 119 via multiple-tube fermentation technique/100 mL, for spinach and lettuce plants, respectively. The study concluded that unofficial reuse of wastewater in irrigation is a principle route for crop contamination. Water quality monitoring programs should be integrated with QMRA investigations for better estimation of risk level. The fit parameters used could be tailored to cover a wide array of local situations in different countries. Models applied for viruses, helminths, and bacteria other than Salmonella are encouraged in future studies. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2020;16:353–361. © 2019 SETAC."

Disease outcome is the result of complex interactions between the host and pathogens. Such interactions lie at the core of future management strategies of enteric diseases. In developed countries of the world, Giardia duodenalis is a common cause of diarrheal disease. In contrast, giardiasis appears to protect children against diarrhea in countries with poor sanitation, via obscure mechanisms. We hypothesized that Giardia may protect its host from disease induced by a co-infecting pathogen such as attaching and effacing Escherichia coli. This enteropathogen is commonly implicated in pediatric diarrhea in developing countries. The findings indicate that co-infection with Giardia attenuates the severity of disease induced by Citrobacter rodentium, an equivalent of A/E E. coli in mice. Co-infection with Giardia reduced colitis, blood in stools, fecal softening, bacterial invasion, and weight loss; the protective effects were lost when co-infection occurred in Nod-like receptor pyrin-containing 3 knockout mice. In co-infected mice, elevated levels of antimicrobial peptides Murine β defensin 3 and Trefoil Factor 3, and enhanced bacterial killing, were NLRP3-dependent. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome in human enterocytes blocked the activation of AMPs and bacterial killing. The findings uncover novel NLRP3-dependent modulatory mechanisms during co-infections with Giardia spp. and A/E enteropathogens, and demonstrate how these interactions may regulate the severity of enteric disease."

Legionella spp. DNA, L. pneumophila DNA and culturable L. pneumophila were detected in 100, 65·5 and 15·9% of the 44 homes, respectively, and culturable levels were comparable to some municipal surveys applying the same methods. Total coliforms and Escherichia coli were monitored as representative faecal indicators and were found in 20·4 and 0·0% of homes. Within certain sample types, Legionella spp. and L. pneumophila gene copy numbers were positively associated with total bacteria (i.e. total 16S rRNA genes) and water softener use, but were not associated with faecal indicator bacteria, inorganic water parameters or other well characteristics. These findings confirm that occurrence of Legionella and L. pneumophila is highly variable in private wells. Significance and Impact of the Study: Legionella is the leading identified cause of waterborne disease outbreaks associated with US municipal water systems. While Legionella is known to occur naturally in groundwater, prior efforts to characterize its occurrence in unregulated private wells are limited to sampling at the wellhead and not in the home plumbing where Legionella can thrive. This work documents much higher levels of Legionella in home plumbing versus water directly from private wells and examines factors associated with higher Legionella occurrence."

We quantified the fecal indicator Escherichia coli and the enteric pathogens of adenovirus, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella spp./enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), and Vibrio cholerae. At least one enteric pathogens was detected in 13% of household stored water, 47% of hand, 46% of table surface, 26% of plate surface, 75% of floor surface, 96% of soil, 56% of standing water, 77% of drainage ditch, and 100% of stream samples despite all households having access to a toilet or latrine. Our results provide evidence that children may be exposed to enteric pathogens from several exposure points, that domestic hygiene practices related to water treatment and child handwashing were associated with reduced pathogen detection in this setting, but household table and floor cleaning practices were not, that ownership or presence of chickens in the compound was associated with increased detection of C. jejuni inside households and on soil, that there were interactions among different transmission pathways for enteric pathogens, and that there were differential correlations between E. coli and enteric pathogens for different pathogens and environmental sample types. Additionally, V. cholerae was detected at several exposure points during a cholera outbreak. Overall, these results suggest that interventions that can disrupt many transmission pathways may be needed to reduce enteric pathogen exposure in this urban slum setting."

Enteric illness outbreaks, and the occurrence of dermatitis and mycoses during the summer season in leisure areas, were usually related to seawater pollution. Pathogenic microorganisms can reach coastal areas through sewage discharges, compromising marine water, and beach quality. Although sand transmission of enteric illness is still unclear, there is an expressed concern that sand may act as reservoirs or vectors for humans infection. In this context, the main hypotheses of this study were: (i) fecal coliforms density changes within beach compartments; (ii) dry sand is the most contaminated beach compartment; (ii) fecal coliforms densities are within international standard limits for sand. Therefore, this case study quantified and compared within three months total fecal bacteria (TC) and thermotolerant coliforms (TEC) densities in seawater, wet, and dry sand of a chosen touristic beach from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Furthermore, to contribute to coastal beach management, sand contamination data surveyed were compared with the standard limits ruling worldwide until April 2018 to check suitableness. Vermelha beach should be considered as a reference beach for sand monitoring in Brazil. Despite being a buffer zone from the MONA Pão Açucar conservation unit, it is subjected to intense touristic pressure. Even though, fecal bacteria densities quantified in Vermelha beach were within the standards of “excellent” quality sand and water according to current legislation/guidelines. However, dry sand was the most contaminated compartment, followed by seawater and wet sand. The bacterial density in dry sand was up to 4,600 times higher than wet sand. Except for Rio de Janeiro city, recreational guidelines for beach quality is exclusive for seawater contamination. There are no established parameters for recreational beach sand classification, only recommendations, including Portugal.

Most of the parameters measured in the stream pools did not accomplish the Ecuadorian and international regulations for recreational water quality. Microbiological water quality diminishes from upstream to downstream pools because of human activities and bathing intensity having potential effects on bather health and eco-touristic development. We found that an increase of bathers is strongly associated with a growing concentration of Escherichia coli. It is suggested better land-use practices and review thoroughly the Ecuadorian regulation to assure a healthy RWQ. Further efforts are needed to identify more risky bathing sites, determine pollution sources, and establish a long-term monitoring program to support the touristic development in countries looking for diversifying their economy."

Concrete, asphalt, pavement blocks and glass as control were inoculated with artificial floodwater containing, as indicator organisms, Escherichia coli bacteria, which are common faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) for water quality assessment, Bacillus subtilis spores chosen as surrogates for Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and Giardia cysts, and bacteriophages MS2 as indicators for viral contamination. On practically all the surfaces in this study, E. coli had the highest inactivation under light conditions followed by MS2 and B. subtilis, except asphalt where MS2 was inactivated faster. The highest inactivation under light conditions was seen with E. coli on a concrete surface (pH 9.6) with an inactivation rate of 1.85 h−1. However, the pH of the surfaces (varying between 7.0 and 9.6) did not have any influence on inactivation rates under dark conditions. MS2 bacteriophage had the highest inactivation under light conditions on asphalt with a rate of 1.29 h−1. No die-off of B. subtilis spores was observed on any of the surfaces during the experiment, neither in light nor in dark conditions. This study underpins the need to use different indicator organisms to test their inactivation after flooding. It also suggests that given the sunlight conditions, concentration of indicator organisms and type of surface, the fate of waterborne pathogens after a flood could be estimated."

Hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS), caused by virulent fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4), is another highly infectious disease in chickens with severe economic impact. The effective way to combat ND and HHS is by vaccinating the poultry. In the present study, a recombinant NDV LaSota vaccine strain expressing full length fiber-2 gene of FAdV-4 (rLaSota-fiber2) was generated using reverse genetics. The FAdV-4 fiber-2 protein was expressed as a soluble form rather than NDV membrane-anchored form. The rLaSota-fiber2 was genetically stable, and it showed growth patterns in embryonated eggs comparable to that of parental rLaSota virus. Since our unpublished data demonstrated that delivery of live rLaSota-fiber2 in drinking water or ocular delivery of the vaccine didn't produce protection against hypervirulent FAdV-4 challenge, even though the vaccine provide full protection against NDV challenge, the efficacy of the rLaSota-fiber2 was evaluated by delivering the vaccine intramuscularly in this study. Single-dose intramuscular vaccination of 2-week-old SPF White Leghorn chicks with the live or inactivated rLaSota-fiber2 provided complete protection against virulent NDV challenge. However, single-dose intramuscular vaccination with the live rLaSota-fiber2 vaccine provided better protection against virulent FAdV-4 challenge and significantly reduced faecal viral shedding comparing to the inactivated vaccine. These results indicate that the NDV-vectored FAdV-4 vaccine is a promising bivalent vaccine candidate to control both HHS and ND."

As there exists little systematic surveillance for enteric infections or outbreaks related to well water sources, consumers may be at risk of waterborne infectious diseases. A standard protocol in Ontario requires 200 mL of water, collected, and submitted by well owners, half of which is used to analyze for Escherichia coli and total coliforms (TCs). The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of testing small water volumes and to survey for other contaminants in addition to bacterial indicators to inform pathogen prevalence and fecal source in drinking water wells. Samples were assessed for E. coli and TCs, by culture, and genetic markers of Bacteroides spp., Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, using qPCR. The source of fecal contamination varied by the geographic region and may be explained by septic tank density and underlying geology, among other factors. A small number of samples (1.9%) showed the evidence of contamination with enteric pathogens. Lastly, E. coli measured by qPCR, as opposed to culture, correlated more strongly to Bacteroides markers."

A total of 1185 water samples were studied. Among them 7.8% and 4.1% gave positive results for total and fecal coliforms, respectively. By employing PCR, a total of 12 diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC) isolates (6 ETEC, 4 STEC, and 2 EPEC) from eight water samples (4, 2, and 2 positives for STEC, ETEC, and EPEC, respectively) were detected including samples collected in schools and a healthcare facility where particularly susceptible hosts are found. Data generated were submitted to georeferencing. A positive correlation (r2 = 0.9) between DEC detection and the rainy period was observed. The presence of DEC in drinking water samples in the studied municipalities highlights the relevance of controlling the sources of human and animal fecal pollution, as well as the management of municipal wastewater sources in order to reduce potential risks to human health.

So far, only PFOA has been shown to have a positive association with ulcerative colitis. The present study aimed to investigate the association of PFAS and clinically diagnosed IBD in the Ronneby cohort, a population with high PFAS exposure (especially high PFOS and PFHxS) from Aqueous Film-Forming Foam through drinking water, using registry data. Additionally, to explore associations of PFAS with fecal zonulin and calprotectin, subclinical biomarkers of gut inflammation and permeability, in a sub-set of participants from Ronneby and Karlshamn (a nearby control municipality). The registry study included all people that ever resided in Ronneby municipality at least one year between 1980 and 2013. Yearly exposure to contaminated drinking water was assessed based on residential addresses and waterworks supply data, and the population classified by early, mid and late periods in ascending level of contamination. Diagnosed IBD cases were retrieved from the Swedish National Patient register and cause-of-death register. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to derive the hazard ratios (HRs) for diagnosed IBD. The biomarker study included 189 individuals who provided fecal samples. Serum PFAS were measured using LC-MS/MS. Fecal zonulin and calprotectin were measured using ELISA. Linear regression was used to assess the associations between measured PFAS and biomarker levels. In the registry study, no raised HRs for diagnosed IBD were found for cohort subjects with mid (1995–2004) or late period (2005–2013) exposure compared to never exposure. Early period exposure only (1985–1994) showed raised HRs for Crohn's disease (HR = 1.58, p = 0.048) and other non-specified IBD (HR = 1.38, p = 0.037). In the biomarker study, Karlshamn showed higher fecal calprotectin levels (median = 99.6 mg/kg in Karlshamn vs. 66.8 mg/kg in Ronneby, p = 0.04). A trend of decreased calprotectin with increased serum PFAS indicated higher PFAS was associated with lower degree of gut inflammation (p = 0.002). No association between serum PFAS and fecal zonulin was found. In conclusion, the present study found no consistent evidence to support PFAS exposure as a risk factor for IBD."

Ziziphus jujuba (ZJ) fruit contains bioactive components such as polysaccharides, triterpenoid acid, and flavonoids, and it has shown anti-inflammatory property. The aim of the study was to investigate the protective effect of dietary ZJ on colitis-associated colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. Mice (n = 42, two sets) were injected with azoxymethane (AOM) followed by three cycles of 2% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water to induce CAC. Simultaneously, those mice were fed with ZJ diet for 70 days (5% or 10% w/w). Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by LSD Bonferroni test. Dietary ZJ decreased fecal blood, diarrhea, disease activity index (DAI), spleen weight (P < 0.001), and the number of tumors (P < 0.001). In addition, dietary ZJ increased colon length (P < 0.001) and suppressed the activation of NF-кB/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. In conclusion, we suggest that dietary ZJ attenuates inflammation by interfering NF-κB/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway, thereby inhibits AOM/DSS-induced colon tumorigenesis in mice."

An alternative to the use of chemicals that has been examined in the context of potable water treatment in developing countries is the use of natural coagulants. Preliminary investigations have been carried out to determine the effectiveness of the seed treatment on bacteria removal. Although helminths have been shown to carry the highest infection risk, initial studies on bacteria were carried out for two reasons; ease of enumeration, and, both elements within the WHO standards must be achieved. Further work using natural coagulants is planned including investigations into the removal of bacteria, protozoa cysts and nematode eggs in a tertiary treatment stage."

Overuse and the addition of the wastes with sources from urbane industrial sectors, as well as the decrease in water level have caused the canal water quality declined drastically and subsequently led to extensive eutrophication and bacterial contamination. According to the water sample analytical results, the water is lightly acidic with the pH value of 4.5~6.7. The measured indexes, such as total dissolved solid (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), total suspended solid (TSS), Mn, Zn, Al, Fe, Cu, Cr, and Hg etc, mostly have very high concentrations which are higher than permissible limit, indicating that the canal water is completely unsuitable for human consumption. Furthermore, the biological analysis shows that the total coliform (TC) is in the range of 45.9~30.2 in per 100 mL water in April, 30.5~25.3/100 mL in July and 52.9~35.4/100 mL in December, respectively. Similarly, fecal coliform (FC) ranges from 12.8 to 10.1, 10.5~7.5 and 13.1~6.4 per 100 mL water in the months of April, July and December respectively. As a result, people who use the water have suffered from different water-borne diseases. On the basis of disease data derived from hospital observations in a period of three years, there had been 4 284 people affected by different waterborne diseases from 2016 to 2018."

The indigenes of the study area, as well as other dwellers in rural areas, consume water from these sources whose quality is unknown; thus, it can lead to contamination and waterborne diseases. Three springs and two streams of Alatening village were investigated in early December 2017 and late July 2018 for organoleptic, physicochemical, and bacteriological parameters using standard methods. The petrographic studies revealed trachyte and benmoreite, and weathering of minerals from these rocks into the soil leads to the water-rock interaction, thus water hydrogeochemistry. All the water samples were clean except that of Alabong which had slight odour due to leaf fall. pH showed acidic water with the springs of Ngog and Alabong falling below the WHO limit in the dry season. Electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids (TDS) were low implying low mineralised water which can also lead to shortage of important minerals in humans. All the essential ions were found within the WHO guideline values without any significant change in concentrations between seasons (p>0.05). The water facies were such as Mg-Ca, Cl-Ca, and HCO3-CO3, suggesting an influence of rock silicate weathering and anthropogenic influence. Aluminium and iron contents were above the WHO limit in both seasons due to their abundance in the soils which could be a risk factor for the local population. Faecal coliforms as well as specific bacteria such as Enterobacter, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, Salmonella, and Shigella were found in all the water samples, attributable to poor hygiene. Health data in the locality indicated the prevalence of typhoid, dysentery, and amoebiasis with a total of 2702 cases recorded between 2016 and 2017, therefore requiring treatment before consumption."

Limited information is available on the presence of HAV, with particular reference to drinking water supplies of primary schools in Sindh, Pakistan. Objectives: The present study estimated the risk of HAV infection through drinking water sources using Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) in primary schools of Sindh, Pakistan. Methods: The QMRA model was applied to estimate the potential health risks of HAV using indicator organisms, i.e., fecal coliforms. Microbial analysis was conducted using a membrane filtration method. The exponential dose-response model was used to calculate the probability of infection. Results: The highest daily risk of HAV infection for schoolchildren was calculated as 35.0 per 10,000 schoolchildren in Karachi district with an annual risk of 66%, whereas the lowest risk was 3.0 per 10,000 schoolchildren in Larkana with 7.8% of the annual risk. The mortality risk due to HAV ranged from 4.0 to 29 deaths per 10,000 children per year. Conclusions: Overall, the drinking water quality of primary schools of Sindh was found very poor. The estimated daily and annual risks of hepatitis A to primary school children were moderate to high. To halt enteric virus transmission through drinking water sources, there is a dire need to invest in the provision of comprehensive water sanitation and hygiene facilities at schools."

We matched fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) data for >37,000 drinking water samples to children aged 0–72 months from 19 studies in low- and middle-income countries and took two complementary analytical approaches. We found that household-level exposure assessments may attenuate effect estimates of FIB concentrations in drinking water on diarrhea, and single water samples may attenuate health effect estimates of FIB concentrations on linear growth. To understand the health effects of fecal contamination exposure, measurement error frameworks can be used to estimate more biologically relevant exposures."

This resource is threatened by the potential presence of faecal bacteria coming from a variety of sources and pollution paths, the former including septic tanks, landfills, and crop irrigation with untreated, or insufficiently treated, sewage effluent. Accurately assessing the microbiological safety of water resources is essential to reduce diseases caused by waterborne faecal exposure. The objective of this study is to discern which are the most significant sanitary, hydrogeological, geochemical, and physical variables influencing the presence of faecal bacterial pollution in groundwater by means of statistical multivariate analyses. The concentration of Escherichia coli was measured in a number of waterpoints of different types in a rural area located in the coast of Kenya, assessing both a dry and a wet season. The results from the analyses reaffirm that the design of the well and their maintenance, the distance to latrines, and the geological structure of the waterpoints are the most significant variables affecting the presence of E. coli. Most notably, the presence of faecal bacteria in the study area correlates negatively with the concentration of ion Na+ (being an indirect indicator of fast recharge in the study site), and also negatively with the length of the water column inside the well."

While access to sanitation facilities is improving, national surveys indicate that even households with latrines often do not safely dispose of their child's feces. Working with caregivers in rural Odisha, India, we co‐developed an intervention aimed at improving safe disposal of child feces and encouraging child latrine use at an earlier age. We describe the rationale for the intervention and summarize the protocol for a cluster randomized trial (CRT) to evaluate its effectiveness at changing CFM practices. METHODS: The intervention consists of six behavior change strategies together with hardware provision: wash basin and bucket with lid to aid safe management of soiled nappies and a novel latrine training mat to aid safe disposal and latrine training. The intervention will be offered at the village level to interested caregivers of children < 5 years of age by a community‐based organization. Following a baseline survey, 74 villages were randomly allocated to either intervention or control arm. The primary outcome is caregiver reported safe disposal of child feces after last defecation, either by the caregiver disposing of the child's feces into the latrine or the child using the latrine, measured approximately four to six months following intervention delivery. Secondary outcomes include fecal contamination of household drinking water and the childs' hands. A process evaluation will also be conducted to assess intervention fidelity and reach, and explore implementer and participant feedback. DISCUSSION: This study addresses a crucial knowledge gap in sanitation by developing a scalable intervention to improve safe management of child feces. The behavior change strategies were designed following the Risks, Attitudes, Norms, Abilities and Self‐Regulation (RANAS) approach, which has shown to be effective for other environmental behavior change interventions in low‐income settings. The latrine training mat hardware is a novel design developed cooperatively and manufactured locally. The evaluation follows a rigorous CRT study design assessing the impact of the intervention on CFM behavior change, as well as fecal contamination of two sources of potential exposure.

"Barriers and Enablers to Intervention Uptake and Health Reporting in a Water Intervention Trial in Rural India: a Qualitative Explanatory Study","McGuinness, SL; O'Toole, J; Ayton, D; Giriyan, A; Gaonkar, CA; Vhaval, R; Cheng, AC; Leder, K","American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","10.4269/ajtmh.19-0486","102","3","2020","Consumption of unsafe drinking water contributes to the global disease burden, necessitating identification and implementation of effective, acceptable, and sustainable water interventions in resource‐limited settings. In a quantitative stepped‐wedge cluster randomized trial of a community‐based water intervention in rural India, we identified low rates of intervention uptake and reported diarrhea. To better understand and explain these findings, we performed a qualitative study examining barriers and enablers to intervention uptake and health reporting using the COM‐B model, where capabilities, opportunities, and motivators interact to generate behavior. We conducted 20 focus groups and one semi‐structured interview with participants and four focus groups with data collectors. Multifactorial barriers to intervention uptake included distorted perceptions of water‐related health effects, implementation issues that reduced treated water availability; convenience of, and preference for, alternative drinking water sources; delivery of water to plastic storage tanks (perceived as affecting water quality and taste); and resistance to change. Enablers included knowledge of water‐related health risks, proximity to tanks, and social opportunity. Barriers to health reporting included variability in interpretation of illness, suspicion regarding the consequences of reporting disease, weariness with repeated questions, and perceived inaction on health data already provided; low survey implementation fidelity was also important. Enablers included surveyor initiatives to encourage reporting and a sense of social responsibility. This qualitative explanatory study allowed better understanding of our quantitative results. It also identified obstacles and facilitators to implementing and evaluating community water interventions, providing insight on how to achieve better intervention uptake and health reporting in future studies."
"The impact of improved water supply on cholera and diarrhoeal diseases in Uvira, Democratic Republic of the Congo: a protocol for a pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial and economic evaluation","Gallandat, K; Jeandron, A; Ross, I; Mufitini Saidi, J; Bashige Rumedeka, B; Lumami Kapepula, V; Cousens, S; Allen, E; MacDougall, A; Cumming, O","Trials","10.1186/s13063-021-05249-x","22","1","2021","INTRODUCTION: Diarrhoeal disease remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Cholera alone is estimated to cause 95,000 deaths per year, most of which occur in endemic settings with inadequate water access. Whilst a global strategy to eliminate cholera by 2030 calls for investment in improved drinking water services, there is limited rigorous evidence for the impact of improved water supply on endemic cholera transmission in low‐income urban settings. Our protocol is designed to deliver a pragmatic health impact evaluation of a large‐scale water supply intervention in Uvira (Democratic Republic of the Congo), a cholera transmission hotspot. METHODS/DESIGN: A stepped‐wedge cluster randomised trial (SW‐CRT) was designed to evaluate the impact of a large‐scale drinking water supply intervention on cholera incidence among the 280,000 inhabitants of Uvira. The city was divided into 16 clusters, where new community and household taps will be installed following a randomised sequence over a transition period of up to 8 weeks in each cluster. The primary trial outcomes are the monthly incidence of ""confirmed"" cholera cases (patients testing positive by rapid detection kit) and of ""suspected"" cholera cases (patients admitted to the cholera treatment centre). Concurrent process and economic evaluations will provide further information on the context, costs, and efficiency of the intervention. DISCUSSION: In this protocol, we describe a pragmatic approach to conducting rigorous research to assess the impacts of a complex water supply intervention on severe diarrhoeal disease and cholera in an unstable, low‐resource setting representative of cholera‐affected areas. In particular, we discuss a series of pre‐identified risks and linked mitigation strategies as well as the value of combining different data collection methods and preparation of multiple analysis scenarios to account for possible deviations from the protocol. The study described here has the potential to provide robust evidence to support more effective cholera control in challenging, high‐burden settings.

"Investigation of an acute diarrhoeal disease outbreak from contaminated drinking water supply, Village A, Patna, Bihar, India July-August 2019","Sinha, UP; Dzeyie, KA; Sangal, L; Bhatnagar, P","BMC proceedings","10.1186/s12919-021-00223-6","15","SUPPL 11","2021","Background Globally, acute diarrhoeal disease causes 525,000 deaths annually [1]. The Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme reported 1,850 acute diarrhoeal disease outbreaks during 2018 throughout India, of which 19 outbreaks occurred in Bihar [2]. On July 4, 2019, the sub‐divisional hospital in Masaurhi Block, Patna, reported 28 acute diarrhoeal disease cases from Village A. This village has 164 houses with a predominantly underserved population of 1,074 persons. The district medical officer initiated the preliminary investigation, medical treatment, and referral of case‐patients. During July 5‐11, 2019, frontline health workers conducted active case searches in Village A and identified additional cases. On August 7, 2019, the World Health Organization Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer joined the outbreak investigation team to describe the epidemiology, identify risk factors, and recommend evidence‐based prevention and control measures for the outbreak. Methods We defined a diarrhoea case as three or more loose stools in less than 24 hours in Village A resident during June 27‐July 20, 2019. We searched for case‐patients with the above definition by conducting a house‐to‐house survey and reviewed outpatient records of the block sub‐divisional hospital and primary health centre. We conducted an unmatched case‐control study and compared cases with the same number of randomly selected controls for risk factors assuming 90% power, odds ratio (OR) of 3, and 50% exposure among controls using Epi Info software [https://www.cdc.gov/epiinfo]. We included apparently healthy residents during the same period of Village A, Masaurhi Block as controls. We collected information about demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, treatment history, exposure factors (source of drinking water, method of purification, and sanitation) using a semi‐structured questionnaire. We calculated proportions, median age, attack rate, case‐fatality rate, and OR with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk factors. Besides, we collected stool samples from 2 case‐patients for bacteriologic culture, tested water samples collected from government‐supplied tap water for residual chlorine, and observed drainage systems in the affected area. Results We identified 81 case‐patients (68% female) during June 20‐August 11; the median age was 25 years (range 1‐85 years). The overall attack was 7.5% (81/1,074); persons ≥60 years of age had the highest attack rate (10/68, 15%). Four (5%) persons died in 4 different households. Of the four deaths, three (75%) occurred in females; three persons who died were >65 years of age, and three were admitted to a hospital. One died at home without any treatment. Cases were distributed throughout Village A and clustered in four households that each reported more than 1 case. The outbreak began on July 2, 2019, peaked on July 3, 2019, with 28 cases, and rapidly declined after that; the last case was reported on July 12, 2019. In addition to diarrhea, case‐patients reported abdominal pain (57/81, 70%), fever (55/81, 68%), and vomiting (9/81, 11%). Eighty (99%) case‐patients visited health facilities; 34 (41%) visited more than one health facility for treatment. A local nonmedical healer conducted initial diarrhoeal management of 34 (41%) case‐patients, 61 (75%) visited the subdivisional hospital, and 19 (23%) visited private clinics. Among casepatients, 73 (90%) reported using the government tap water supply as their drinking water source, and 30 (37%) boiled water before drinking. In the case‐control study of 81 cases and 81 controls, drinking government‐supplied tap water (OR 16.4 [95% CI 6.9‐38.7]) was associated with illness. Drinking bore well water (OR 0.9 [95% CI 0.026‐0.32), hand‐pumped water (OR 0.1 [95% CI 0.05‐0.3]), and water treated before drinking (OR 0.2 [95% CI 0.1‐0.4]) were protective (Table 1). Laboratory investigation of 2 fecal samples did not detect any pathogenic organism. Testing one water sample did not detect bacteria, and the residual chlorine level was within the permissible limit of 250 mg/dL [3]. We observed a poor drainage system with waterlogging and overflowing that provided potential contamination of water supply pipes. Conclusions In this investigation of an acute diarrhoeal disease outbreak, the illness was probably more likely associated with government‐supplied tap water contamination. We recommended that local health authorities create community awareness through frontline workers to boil water or use filtration methods before drinking government‐supplied tap water. Besides, we recommended that the Masaurhi sub‐district hospital in charge and district administration ensure a regular supply of clean drinking water by regular chlorination, conduct periodic quality checks, and immediately repair the damaged drainage system. Prompt response by the district health authorities in treating case‐patients and decontaminating drinking water sources helped control the outbreak."

Children raised in countries with high infectious disease burdens are frequently exposed to diarrhoeal pathogens and antibiotics, which perturb gut microbiome assembly. A recent cluster‐randomized trial leveraging >4,000 child observations in Dhaka, Bangladesh, found that automated water chlorination of shared taps effectively reduced child diarrhoea and antibiotic use. In this substudy, we leveraged stool samples collected from 130 children 1 year after chlorine doser installation to examine differences between treatment and control children’s gut microbiota. Water chlorination was associated with increased abundance of several bacterial genera previously linked to improved gut health; however, we observed no effects on the overall richness or diversity of taxa. Several clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes were relatively more abundant in the gut microbiome of treatment children, possibly due to increases in Enterobacteriaceae. While further studies on the long‐term health impacts of drinking chlorinated water would be valuable, we conclude that access to chlorinated water did not substantially impact child gut microbiome development in this setting, supporting the use of chlorination to increase global access to safe drinking water."

Methods: This study included 224 mothers of under‐five children living in urban slums of Udupi Taluk, Karnataka. A total of 17 urban slums were selected randomly using random cluster sampling. Results: Undernutrition was high among children of illiterate mothers (63.8%), and the children of working mothers were affected by more morbidity (96.6%) as compared with housewives. Morbidity was also found to be high among children belonging to families with low incomes (66.1%) and low socio‐economic backgrounds (93.1%). Safe drinking water, water supply, sanitation, hygiene, age of the child, mother's and father's education, mother's occupation and age, number of children in the family, use of mosquito nets, type of household, and family income were significantly associated with child morbidity, nutritional status, immunization status, and personal hygiene of under‐five children living in urban slums. Conclusion: Overall, in our study, family characteristics including parental education, occupation and income were significantly associated with outcomes among under‐five children. The availability of safe drinking water and sanitation, and the use of mosquito nets to prevent vector‐borne diseases are basic needs that need to be urgently met to improve child health.

"Prevalence of diarrheal diseases among schools with and without water, sanitation and hygiene programs in rural communities of north-eastern Ethiopia: a comparative cross-sectional study","Gebrehiwot, T; Geberemariyam, BS; Gebretsadik, T; Gebresilassie, A","Rural and remote health","10.22605/RRH4907","20","4","2020","INTRODUCTION: Diarrheal diseases are a significant cause of morbidity among school‐aged children due to inadequate sanitation, lack of access to potable water and poor hygiene practices. Although the incidence of these illnesses can be reduced through improved water quality and the introduction of sanitation and hygiene programs in schools, there is limited evidence to demonstrate the impact of interventions in schools in Ethiopia. The purpose of this study was to compare the prevalence and associated factors of diarrheal diseases in school‐aged children between schools in Habru District, north‐eastern Ethiopia that adopted water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions and those that did not. METHODS: A comparative cross‐sectional study was conducted among 640 randomly selected school children (160 from schools that adopted WASH interventions and 480 from schools that did not). Trained data collectors used a pre‐tested structured questionnaire and an observational checklist to collect the data. Descriptive statistics, such as frequencies and percentages, were computed to present the prevalence of diarrheal disease. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with diarrheal disease. RESULTS: The overall 2‐week prevalence of diarrhea among school children was 30.5%. In WASH‐implementing schools, the prevalence was 21.9%, significantly lower than in non‐WASH‐implementing schools (33.3%). In non‐WASH‐implementing schools, the odds of diarrheal diseases among students were significantly decreased in those students who used a clean school latrine, self‐reported latrine utilization at home and were aware of the causes of diarrhea. Similarly, among students in WASH‐implementing schools, self‐reported latrine utilization at home, personal hygiene inspection and awareness of the causes of diarrhea were factors associated with decreasing odds of diarrhea occurrence. CONCLUSION: This study identified a high prevalence of a diarrheal disease among children in schools with no WASH interventions compared with schools that do have WASH interventions. This provides strong evidence for strengthening WASH programs in all rural schools to reduce the burden of diarrheal diseases."
"Impact of integrated water, sanitation, hygiene, health and nutritional interventions on diarrhoea disease epidemiology and microbial quality of water in a resource-constrained setting in Kenya: a controlled intervention study","Wandera, EA; Muriithi, B; Kathiiko, C; Mutunga, F; Wachira, M; Mumo, M; Mwangi, A; Tinkoi, J; Meiguran, M; Akumu, P; Ndege, V; Kasiku, F; Ang'awa, J; Mochizuki, R; Kaneko, S; Morita, K; Ouma, C; Ichinose, Y","Tropical medicine & international health","10.1111/tmi.13793","27","8","2022","OBJECTIVES: We assessed the impact of water, hygiene and sanitation (WASH), maternal, new‐born and child health (MNCH), nutrition and early childhood development (ECD) on diarrhoea and microbial quality of water in a resource‐constrained rural setting in Kenya. METHODS: Through a controlled intervention study, we tested faecal and water samples collected from both the intervention and control sites before and after the interventions using microbiological, immunological and molecular assays to determine the prevalence of diarrhoeagenic agents and microbial quality of water. Data from the hospital registers were used to estimate all‐cause diarrhoea prevalence. RESULTS: After the interventions, we observed a 58.2% (95% CI: 39.4‐75.3) decline in all‐cause diarrhoea in the intervention site versus a 22.2% (95% CI: 5.9‐49.4) reduction of the same in the control site. Besides rotavirus and pathogenic Escherichia coli, the rate of isolation of other diarrhoea‐causing bacteria declined substantially in the intervention site. The microbial quality of community and household water improved considerably in both the intervention (81.9%; 95% CI: 74.5%‐87.8%) and control (72.5%; 95% CI: 64.2%‐80.5%) sites with the relative improvements in the intervention site being slightly larger. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated WASH, MNCH, nutrition and ECD interventions resulted in notable decline in all‐cause diarrhoea and improvements in water quality in the rural resource‐limited population in Kenya. This indicates a direct public health impact of the interventions and provides early evidence for public health policy makers to support the sustained implementation of these interventions."

This study identified the determinants of RVV immunogenicity among infants in rural Zimbabwe. Methods: Anti‐rotavirus IgA titres were measured among a sub‐group of infants enrolled in the Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trial (NCT01824940). SHINE was a cluster‐randomized trial of improved infant and young child feeding, and improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in two rural Zimbabwean districts. Infants received RVV as part of the national immunisation programme. Among HIV‐unexposed infants in the non‐WASH trial arms, we evaluated associations between potential risk factors (vaccine schedule and dose, maternal and infant nutritional status, infant diarrhoea, and household environment) and RVV immunogenicity (seroconversion, seropositivity and geometric mean titres) using multivariable regression. Results: Among 219 infants with seroconversion data, 43 (20%) successfully seroconverted and 176 (80%) failed to seroconvert to RVV. Seroconversion was positively associated with a higher length‐for‐age Z‐score (LAZ) around the time of vaccination (adjusted RR 1.27 (95% CI 1.04, 1.55), P = 0.021), and negatively associated with concurrent OPV and RVV administration (adjusted RR 0.36 (0.19, 0.71), P = 0.003). Among 472 infants with post‐vaccination titres, a higher LAZ score was associated with increased seropositivity (aRR 1.21 (95% CI 1.06, 1.38), P = 0.004), and higher birthweight was associated with increased IgA titres (0.45 (95%CI 0.18, 1.09) U/mL greater per 100 g gain in birthweight; P = 0.001). Conclusions: Infant ponderal and linear growth were positively associated with RVV immunogenicity, while concurrent administration of OPV was negatively associated with RVV immunogenicity. Together, these findings suggest that improving foetal growth and separating RVV and OPV administration are plausible approaches to increasing RVV immunogenicity."

Inadequate MHM has been associated with urogenital infections. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a combined household‐level piped water and sanitation intervention on MHM practices and urogenital infection symptoms (UGS) among women living in rural communities of Odisha (India). This study was nested within a pair‐matched cohort study designed to assess impact of the Gram Vikas MANTRA program, which provided household‐level piped water, bathing areas and latrine to all households in intervention villages, on diarrheal disease (primary outcome). The program did not specifically promote menstrual hygiene practices. Forty‐five intervention villages were randomly selected from a list of those where implementation was previously completed at least five years before and matched to 45 control villages. Data for the main study was collected in four rounds from June 2015 to October 2016. For the MHM sub study, household surveys were administered in round four to randomly selected women aged 18 or older among study households from the 90 villages, to assess self‐reported MHM practicesand urogenital infections symptoms. MHM practices were deemed adequate if they met some of the criteria developed on the basis of international monitoring that the GV program could modify (adequate frequency of absorbent change, washing the body with soap and privacy for managing menstruation). Multilevel mixed‐effects logistic regression with a random effect distribution at the level of the pair and village was used to estimate the effect of the intervention on adequate MHM practices (primary outcome) and reported UGS (secondary outcome). A total of 1045 women (517 from intervention and 528 from control) were included in the study. Women who lived in the villages receiving the intervention, were more likely to report adequate MHM practices than those in control villages (Adjusted OR (AOR) 3.54, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.86‐6.78). 14.51% and 15.53% of women living in the control and intervention villages reported having at least one UGS. There was no evidence of an intervention effect on reported UGS (AOR = 0.97, 95%CI: 0.64‐1.46). While household latrines or bathing areas with access to piped water improve the environment that enable MHM practices related to privacy, the provision of such facilities alone had only a moderate impact in adequate MHM and did not have an effect on self‐reported UGS. More targeted inventions that include behavior change strategies and that address other barriers may be necessary to improve MHM practices."

Conducted from February to December 2018 in rural Malawi, this before and after trial with a control used diarrhoeal disease as a primary outcome, to measure the impact of a food hygiene intervention (food hygiene + handwashing) relative to a food hygiene and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) intervention (food hygiene + handwashing + faeces management + water management). The 31‐week intervention was delivered by community‐based coordinators through community events (n = 2), cluster group meetings (n = 17) and household visits (n = 14). Diarrhoeal disease was self‐reported and measured through an end line survey, and daily diaries completed by caregivers. Difference‐in‐differences results show a 13‐percentage point reduction in self‐reported diarrhoea compared to the control group. There were also significant increases in the presence of proxy measures in each of the treatment groups (e.g., the presence of soap). We conclude that food hygiene interventions (including hand washing with soap) can significantly reduce diarrhoeal disease prevalence in children under five years in a low‐income setting. Therefore, the promotion of food hygiene practices using a behaviour‐centred approach should be embedded in nutrition and WASH policies and programming."
"Baseline patterns of infection in regions of Benin, Malawi and India seeking to interrupt transmission of soil transmitted helminths (STH) in the DeWorm3 trial",NA,"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","10.1371/journal.pntd.0008771","14","11","2020","Global efforts to control morbidity associated with soil‐transmitted helminth infections (STH) have focused largely on the targeted treatment of high‐risk groups, including children and pregnant women. However, it is not clear when such programs can be discontinued and there are concerns about the sustainability of current STH control programs. The DeWorm3 project is a large multi‐country community cluster randomized trial in Benin, India and Malawi designed to determine the feasibility of interrupting the transmission of STH using community‐wide delivery of mass drug administration (MDA) with anthelmintics over multiple rounds. Here, we present baseline data and estimate key epidemiological parameters important in determining the likelihood of transmission interruption in the DeWorm3 trial. A baseline census was conducted in October‐December 2017 in India, November‐December 2017 in Malawi and in January‐February 2018 in Benin. The baseline census enumerated all members of each household and collected demographic data and information on occupation, assets, and access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Each study site was divided into 40 clusters of at least 1,650 individuals per cluster. Clusters were randomized to receive twice yearly community‐wide MDA with albendazole (GSK) targeting eligible individuals of all ages (20 clusters), or to receive the standard‐of‐care deworming program targeting children provided in each country. In each site, a randomly selected group of 150 individuals per cluster (6,000 total per site) was selected from the baseline census using stratified random sampling, and each individual provided a single stool sample for analysis of STH infection using the Kato‐Katz technique. Study site, household and individual characteristics were summarized as appropriate. We estimated key epidemiological parameters including the force of infection and the degree of parasite aggregation within the population. The DeWorm3 sites range in population from 94,969 to 140,932. The population age distribution varied significantly by site, with the highest proportion of infants and young children in Malawi and the highest proportion of adults in India. The baseline age‐ and cluster‐weighted prevalence, as measured by Kato‐Katz, varied across sites and by species, Baseline hookworm prevalence in India was 21.4% (95% CI: 20.4‐22.4%), while prevalence of Ascaris and Trichuris by Kato‐Katz was low (0.1% and 0.3% overall). In Malawi, the overall age‐ and cluster‐weighted STH prevalence was 7.7% (95% CI: 7.1‐8.4%) predominantly driven by hookworm infections (7.4%) while Ascaris (0.1%) and Trichuris (0.3%) infections were rare. In Benin, the overall age‐ and cluster‐weighted prevalence was significantly lower (5.6%, 95% CI: 5.1‐6.2%) and Ascaris (2.0%, 95% CI: 1.6‐2.3%) was more common than in other sites. Ascaris infections were more likely to be moderate‐ or heavy‐intensity (43.7%, unweighted) compared to hookworm (5.0%). The force of infection for hookworm was highest in adults in India and Malawi but appeared relatively stable across age groups in Benin. These data demonstrate the significant variability between the sites in terms of demography, socio‐economic status and environmental characteristics. In addition, the baseline prevalence and intensity data from DeWorm3 suggest that each site has unique epidemiologic characteristics that will be critical in determining correlates of achieving STH transmission interruption in the DeWorm3 trial. Trial registration: The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03014167)."

Shigella is a leading contributor to diarrheal diseases caused by bacterial pathogens and is considered a significant antimicrobial resistance threat. While improvements in hygiene, and access to clean water help as control measures, vaccination remains one of the most viable options for significantly reducing morbidity and mortality. Methods: Flexyn2a is a bioconjugate vaccine manufactured using novel conjugation methodologies enzymatically linking the O‐polysaccharide of S. flexneri 2a to exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The protective capacity of Flexyn2a was assessed in a controlled human infection model after two intramuscular immunizations. Immune responses pre‐ and post‐immunization and/or infection were investigated and are described here. Findings: Flexyn2a induced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‐specific serum IgG responses post‐immunization which were associated with protection against shigellosis. Additionally, several other immune parameters, including memory B cell responses, bactericidal antibodies and serum IgA, were also elevated in vaccinees protected against shigellosis. Immunization with Flexyn2a also induced gut‐homing, LPS‐specific IgG and IgA secreting B cells, indicating the vaccine induced immune effectors functioning at the site of intestinal infection. Interpretation: Collectively, the results of these immunological investigations provide insights into protective immune mechanisms post‐immunization with Flexyn2a which can be used to further guide vaccine development and may have applicability to the larger Shigella vaccine field. Funding: Funding for this study was provided through a Wellcome Trust grant."

The present controlled‐intervention study investigated the relationship between patterns of dietary intake and baseline gut microbiota in CD patients in remission and examined the effects of a dietary intervention in patients consuming a non‐diversified diet [NDD]. METHODS: Forty outpatients with quiescent CD were recruited in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Based on 3‐day food records, patients consuming a lower plant‐based and higher red and processed meat‐based diet were assigned to the NDD group [n = 15] and received a 12‐week structured dietary intervention; all other patients were assigned to the diversified diet [DD] control group [n = 25] and received conventional management. Faecal microbiota composition, short chain fatty acids [SCFAs] and calprotectin were measured. RESULTS: At baseline the NDD and DD groups had a different faecal microbial beta‐diversity [p = 0.003, permutational multivariate analysis of variance]. The NDD group had lower Faecalibacterium and higher Escherichia/Shigella relative abundances compared to the DD group [3.3 ± 5.4% vs. 8.5 ± 10.6%; 6.9 ± 12.2% vs. 1.6 ± 4.4%; p ≤ 0.03, analysis of covariance]. These two genera showed a strong negative correlation [rs = ‐0.60, q = 0.0002]. Faecal butyrate showed a positive correlation with Faecalibacterium [rs = 0.52, q = 0.002], and an inhibitory relationship with Escherichia/Shigella abundance [four‐parameter sigmoidal model, R = ‐0.83; rs = ‐0.44, q = 0.01], respectively. After the 12 weeks of dietary intervention, no difference in microbial beta‐diversity between the two groups was observed [p = 0.43]. The NDD group demonstrated an increase in Faecalibacterium [p < 0.05, generalized estimated equation model], and resembled the DD group at the end of the intervention [p = 0.84, t‐test with permutation]. We did not find an association of diet with faecal SCFAs or calprotectin. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary patterns are associated with specific gut microbial compositions in CD patients in remission. A diet intervention in patients consuming a NDD modifies gut microbial composition to resemble that seen in patients consuming a DD. These results show that diet is important in shaping the microbial dysbiosis signature in CD towards a balanced community."
"Outcome of Non-Myeloablative Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Multiple Sclerosis: a Single Center Summary of 511 Patients","Burt, RK; Han, X; Quigley, K; Balabanov, R","Bone marrow transplantation","10.1038/s41409-021-01342-6","56",NA,"2021","Background: The MIST randomized trial of 100 patients (55 in each arm) of nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) versus continued disease modifying therapy (DMT) for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) demonstrated marked superiority for HSCT. However, no large trial of non‐myeloablative HSCT for RRMS has been published to date. Methods: Five hundred and eleven patients at Northwestern University between 7‐2003 and 10‐2019 underwent non‐myeloablative HSCT using a non‐selected graft and cyclophosphamide (Cy)/rabbit anti‐thymocyte globulin (ATG) (n = 376), Cy/ATG/rituximab (n = 63), Cy/ATG/intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (n = 46), or Cy/alemtuzumab (n = 26). Either an intravenous cephalosporin cefepime (maxipimeâ) or piperacillin/tozobactam (zosyn®) was started on day 0 and continued until engraftment that usually occurred on day 9 or 10. Results: There was one treatment related death (0.19%, 1/511) due to legionella pneumonia acquired from the hospital room shower head. Only one of 511 patients developed bacteremia (Klebsiella pneumonia). Overall survival was 98.6%. Six patients had late non‐treatment related deaths, a cerebrovascular accident related to medication non‐compliance, a myocardial infarction, and during an elective cholecystectomy (unknown cause); colon cancer; and one died of respiratory failure from relapsed NMO (misdiagnosed as MS). The secondary autoimmune diseases (2ndADs) that occurred post HSCT were idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) and hypo or hyperthyroidism. The incidence of ITP was highest with alemtuzumab (14%) and 0 to 2.8% for the non‐alemtuzumab regimens. Before HSCT, hypothyroidism was present in 10.4% (n = 53) and hyperthyroidism in 1.5% (n = 8) of patients. After HSCT, 16 patients developed hypothyroidism (3.5% 16/450 at risk) and 15 developed hyperthyroidism/Grave's disease (3.3%). Probability of relapse free survival at 6 months, and 1, 2, 3,4, and 5 years after HSCT was 99%, 96%, 94%, 92%, and 89.5%, respectively (figure 1A). Disability measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) improved for the entire group (figure 1B) from a mean before HSCT of 4.0, to 3.04, 2.95, 2.96, 2.86, 2.78, and 2.54 at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively (all p < 0.00001). Patients treated with different non‐myeloablative conditioning regimens had similar post improvements in baseline EDSS (figure 1 B). Conclusions: Autologous non‐myeloablative HSCT provides drug free reversal of neurologic disability of greater than 1.0 EDSS points for greater than 5 years in 89% of patients with RRMS. The low incidence of bacteremia may be related to the use of non‐myeloablative regimens that do not cause mucositis, i.e. gut endothelium bacterial barrier remains closed, placement and removal of the large bore apheresis catheter on the same day and subsequent insertion of a PICC line in the upper inner arm on day of admission resulting in less risk of cutaneous barrier breaches, a HEPAfiltered floor, and to the use of pre‐emptive antibiotics when neutropenic. On the other hand, one patient developed legionella pneumonia that was subsequently cultured from the showerhead. Control over the hospital water supply is therefore of major importance. Care of these patients requires thoughtful monitoring, documentation, and prophylaxis of infections and 2ndADs."
"Prevalence and Determinants of Diarrheal Diseases among Under-Five Children in Horo Guduru Wollega Zone, Oromia Region, Western Ethiopia: a Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study","Alemayehu, K; Oljira, L; Demena, M; Birhanu, A; Workineh, D","Canadian journal of infectious diseases and medical microbiology","10.1155/2021/5547742","2021",NA,"2021","Background. Diarrheal diseases are the leading cause of preventable death, especially among under‐five children in developing countries, including Ethiopia. Although efforts have been made to reduce the morbidity and mortality resulting from diarrheal diseases, there is scarce information on the progress of the interventions against the burdens. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of diarrhea and its associated factors in under‐five children in Horo Guduru Wollega Zone, Oromia Region, Western Ethiopia. Methods. A community‐based cross‐sectional study was conducted. Of 12,316 households, 620 households that had under‐five children were selected by simple random sampling technique from randomly selected kebeles. Before data collection, a pretest of the structured questionnaires was done on nonselected kebeles. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the association of the diarrheal diseases with independent variables. Finally, the odds ratio along with a 95% confidence interval was used to report the significant association between the outcome variable and its associated factors. A P value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant Results. The prevalence of diarrhea among under‐five children was 149 (24%) (95% CI: 20.8, 27.3). Diarrhea was significantly associated with poor knowledge of mothers/caretakers on diarrhea prevention methods (AOR: 2.05, 95% CI (1.14, 3.69), being in the age group of 6‐11(AOR = 1.546 (1.68, 3.52), and 12‐23 months (AOR = 1.485 (1.84, 2.63)), families with poor wealth index (AOR: 2.41, 95% CI (1.29, 4.51)), children who were not vaccinated against measles (AOR: 4.73, 95% CI (2.43, 9.20)), unsafe child feces disposal (AOR = 3.75; 95% CI (1.91, 7.39)), inappropriate liquid waste disposal (AOR = 3.73 (1.94, 7.42)), and having two or more siblings (AOR: 3.11, 95% CI (1.81, 5.35)). Conclusion and Remarks. The prevalence of diarrhea among under‐five children was high. There was a statistically significant association between diarrhea and age of the child (6‐11 and 12‐23), poor knowledge of mothers/caretakers on diarrhea prevention methods, families with poor wealth index, being unvaccinated against measles, improper liquid waste disposal, unsafe child feces disposal, and having at least two siblings. The findings have a significant policy inference for childhood diarrheal disease prevention programs. Therefore, educating mothers/caregivers on diarrheal disease prevention methods, child spacing, regular hand washing practice after disposing child feces, safely disposing liquid waste, and vaccinating all eligible children against measles should be a priority area of intervention for diarrheal disease prevention. Moreover, since these associated factors are preventable, the government needs to strengthen the health extension workers program implementations to reduce childhood diarrhea."
"Effectiveness of autoclave combination treatment with andosol soil to decrease the number of bacillus cereus","Marsum, ; Anies, ; Widjanarko, B; Wahyuningsih, NE","Systematic reviews in pharmacy","10.5530/srp.2020.2.95","11","2","2020","Strict regulations and permits in managing medical waste create dependency on third party. This has an impact on medical waste especially syringe medical waste which must be piled up waiting for the collection process. Improper handling medical waste may cause accidents and disease transmission. Soil has been known to be used as an antibacterial in medicine, but there is still little in the process of application in medical waste management. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of the use of autoclaves combined with andisol soils to decrease the number of bacterial colonies of Bacillus cereus. This study uses a true experiment design using a completely randomized design. The research was carried out starting from the isolation of bacteria from syringe medical waste and rejuvenation on sterile media to test the effect of the application treatment on a laboratory. Anova Repeated Measure Test (Ranova) at alpha 0.05 was used to determine differences in the number of bacteria that grew in the media before and after treatment. The results of this study indicate the combination treatment of autoclaves in the variation of contact time with andosol soils at variations in concentration produced the difference (p <0.001) with the number of bacterial colonies Bacillus cereus between 290,000‐340,000 CFU / ml and the effectiveness of all treatments reaches 100%. At the end of this study, a combination of autoclave treatment at a temperature of 121 0C was taken for 15 minutes with andosol soil treatment at a concentration of 45% with a contact duration of 2 minutes that could be applied independently at the hospital."
"Infection prevention and control compliance in Tanzanian outpatient facilities: a cross-sectional study with implications for the control of COVID-19","Powell-Jackson, T; King, JJC; Makungu, C; Spieker, N; Woodd, S; Risha, P; Goodman, C","The Lancet. Global health","10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30222-9","8","6","2020","BACKGROUND: As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) spreads, weak health systems must not become a vehicle for transmission through poor infection prevention and control practices. We assessed the compliance of health workers with infection prevention and control practices relevant to COVID‐19 in outpatient settings in Tanzania, before the pandemic. METHODS: This study was based on a secondary analysis of cross‐sectional data collected as part of a randomised controlled trial in private for‐profit dispensaries and health centres and in faith‐based dispensaries, health centres, and hospitals, in 18 regions. We observed provider‐patient interactions in outpatient consultation rooms, laboratories, and dressing rooms, and categorised infection prevention and control practices into four domains: hand hygiene, glove use, disinfection of reusable equipment, and waste management. We calculated compliance as the proportion of indications (infection risks) in which a health worker performed a correct action, and examined associations between compliance and health worker and facility characteristics using multilevel mixed‐effects logistic regression models. FINDINGS: Between Feb 7 and April 5, 2018, we visited 228 health facilities, and observed at least one infection prevention and control indication in 220 facilities (118 [54%] dispensaries, 66 [30%] health centres, and 36 [16%] hospitals). 18 710 indications were observed across 734 health workers (49 [7%] medical doctors, 214 [29%] assistant medical officers or clinical officers, 106 [14%] nurses or midwives, 126 [17%] clinical assistants, and 238 [32%] laboratory technicians or assistants). Compliance was 6·9% for hand hygiene (n=8655 indications), 74·8% for glove use (n=4915), 4·8% for disinfection of reusable equipment (n=841), and 43·3% for waste management (n=4299). Facility location was not associated with compliance in any of the infection prevention and control domains. Facility level and ownership were also not significantly associated with compliance, except for waste management. For hand hygiene, nurses and midwives (odds ratio 5·80 [95% CI 3·91‐8·61]) and nursing and medical assistants (2·65 [1·67‐4·20]) significantly outperformed the reference category of assistant medical officers or clinical officers. For glove use, nurses and midwives (10·06 [6·68‐15·13]) and nursing and medical assistants (5·93 [4·05‐8·71]) also significantly outperformed the reference category. Laboratory technicians performed significantly better in glove use (11·95 [8·98‐15·89]), but significantly worse in hand hygiene (0·27 [0·17‐0·43]) and waste management (0·25 [0·14‐0·44] than the reference category. Health worker age was negatively associated with correct glove use and female health workers were more likely to comply with hand hygiene. INTERPRETATION: Health worker infection prevention and control compliance, particularly for hand hygiene and disinfection, was inadequate in these outpatient settings. Improvements in provision of supplies and health worker behaviours are urgently needed in the face of the current pandemic.

"EMPYEMA THORACIS: a COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF TB AND NON-TB ETIOLOGY AND THEIR OUTCOMES","Chandra Davuluri, P","Chest","10.1016/j.chest.2020.08.348","158","4","2020","SESSION TITLE: Chest Infections Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18‐21, 2020 PURPOSE: 1. To study the tuberculous and non‐tuberculous patterns in the etiology of Empyema. 2. To compare the age, sex distribution among tuberculous and non‐tubercluous groups. 3. To know the effect of early intervention, prognosis, treatment modalities and outcomes in tuberculous and non‐tuberculous empyema. METHODS: A prospective study of empyema thoracis was conducted on 52 consecutive patients with empyema thoracis admitted to the tuberculosis and chest diseases ward of a teaching hospital over one‐and‐a‐half‐year period with the objective of comparing the etiology, clinical profiles and outcomes of patients. The demographic data, clinical presentation, microbiological findings, etiology, the clinical course and management were recorded as per a planned pro forma and analyzed. RESULTS: Out of 52 cases, 30 (57.7%) cases were of non TB etiology where as TB constitute 42.3%. Gram negative organisms 28.8% cases, Gm+ve 15.3%. In TB empyema mean age of presentation was 35.8 years & 44.46 yrs in non TB. Average duration of symptom presentation in TB & non TB empyema are 40.35 & 21.13 days respectively. Mean duration of intercostal tube drainage in TB was 33.55 days vs 18.36 days in non TB empyema. Bronchopleural fistula present in 54.54% of tuberculous versus 20% of non‐tuberculous empyema. Good lung expansion with minimal pleural thickening seen in 25(83.33%) cases of non TB cases but only 59% cases of TB empyema had good resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Empyema continues to be prevalent in our country particularly in the lower socioeconomic strata due to the delay in seeking medical care, inappropriate antibiotics and dosages and duration of antibiotic treatment. Pleural fluid biochemical parameters would also vary depending on the stage of empyema, severity and previous antibiotic therapy. Management of primary empyema continues to be controversial in terms of duration of antibiotic therapy and the indications for and timing of surgery. There is a need for randomized controlled trials for strict guidelines on the management of empyema Tuberculous empyema differs from non‐tuberculous empyema in the age profile, Clinical presentation, management issues, and has a significantly poorer outcome. All cases of empyema with bronchopleural fistula should be managed by intercostal drainage tube connected to water seal. It was also observed that all cases of empyema complicated by bronchopleural fistula were difficult to manage and needed major surgery. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Tuberculous empyema remains a significant cause of empyema thoracis in India. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of rapid diagnostic tools like CBNAAT with reliable sensitivity and specificity in the diagnostic algorithm for the early diagnosis of tuberculous empyema which would help in planning the treatment of empyema.

Ten or more households with toilets renovated from !""$' to !""!"" were randomly selected from each village for the household site‐visit to collect the information of general condition of household toilet reconstruction, the type of septic tank and its effective volume, and the outflow of the fecal fluid of the third compartment. Fecal fluid samples from the first and third compartment were collected to examine the fecal coliform value, five ‐day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (AN) and parasite eggs. Household questionnaire was conducted to collect the information of residents"" satisfaction with toilet improvement and the way using fecal manure. The overall incidence of intestinal infectious diseases during 2016—2020 was retrieved from the data reported by local township health clinics. Furthermore, the economic expenditures caused by intestinal infectious diseases were also collected in the year of 2015 and 2020 in each investigated village. Paired ! test was used for the difference comparison of fecal coliform value, COD, BOD5 and AN between the first and third tank compartments. Results Totally 367 households from 26 administrative villages were investigated. The main type of septic tank were constructed with brick and prefabricated cement parts, each type of which accounted for 42.7% (157/367) and 24.5% (90/367), respectively. The septic tanks with effective volume reaching 1.5 m3 accounted for 93.0% (279/300). The fecal fluid from the tank‐third compartment was mostly used as field fertilizer (212/290). The coliform values of fecal fluid in first and third compartment were (119.8 ± 33.4) and (42.0 ± 18.5) coliform/ml, with significant difference between the compartments (! = 6.534, "" < 0.01). The concentrations of BOD5, COD and AN in the fecal fluid in the tank‐first compartment were (354.7 ± 124.8), (1 021.8 ± 352.5) and (119.2 ± 64.3) mg/L, while those in the tank‐third compartment were (138.6 ± 62.4), (531.1 ± 229.6) and (96.3 ± 42.7) mg/L, repectively, with significant differences between the first and the third tank compartment (! = 5.042, 9.631, 2.455, "" < 0.01). No human parasite eggs were detected from all fecal fluid samples. From 2016 to 2020, the incidence of overall intestinal infectious diseases in the community (towns) that the surveyed village affiliated to was reduced from 24.6/100 000 in 2016 to 4.3/100 000 in 2020. A total of 305 household questionnaires were performed and the awareness rate of toilet related knowledge, the positive support to toilet renovation and the satisfaction rate in this aspect reached to 95.1% (290/305), 100% (303/303), and 96.7% (291/301), respectively.

"Waterborne outbreaks: a public health concern for rural municipalities with unchlorinated drinking water distribution systems","Soto, JC; Barakat, M; Drolet, MJ; Gauvin, D; Huot, C","Canadian journal of public health = revue canadienne de sante publique","10.17269/s41997-020-00300-x","111","3","2020","OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to describe an important waterborne outbreak of gastrointestinal illness observed in a rural municipality of Quebec. METHODS: A population‐based retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify risk factors associated with acute gastroenteritis. Indirect surveillance data were used to estimate the extent and the resolution of the epidemic. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 140 randomly selected individuals of whom 22 met the illness case definition (15.7% attack rate). The epidemic curve was similar to the evolution of antidiarrheal products sold by the only pharmacy in town and calls made to the Health Info Line. Bivariate analysis led to identifying five risk factors of gastrointestinal illness: consumption of municipal water, contact with someone with acute gastroenteritis (within and outside of the household), contact with a child in daycare, and being less than 35 years of age. Drinking municipal water had the highest risk ratio (RR = 24.31; 95% CI = 1.50‐393.4). Drinking water from a private artesian well was a protective factor (RR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.09‐0.90). CONCLUSION: This study highlighted that managing the risks associated with the consumption of untreated drinking water remains an important public health challenge, particularly in small rural municipalities vulnerable to climate variability."

This cluster‐randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effects of a school garden programme and complementary nutrition, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions on children's health and nutritional status in two districts of Nepal. METHODS: The trial included 682 children aged 8‐17 years from 12 schools. The schools were randomly allocated to one of three interventions: (a) school garden programme (SG; 4 schools, n = 172 children); (b) school garden programme with complementary WASH, health and nutrition interventions (SG+; 4 schools, n = 197 children); and (c) no specific intervention (control; 4 schools, n = 313 children). The same field and laboratory procedures were employed at the baseline (March 2015) and end‐line (June 2016) surveys. Questionnaires were administered to evaluate WASH conditions at schools and households. Water quality was assessed using a Delagua kit. Dietary intake was determined using food frequency and 24‐h recall questionnaire. Haemoglobin levels were measured using HemoCue digital device and used as a proxy for anaemia. Stool samples were subjected to a suite of copro‐microscopic diagnostic methods for detection of intestinal protozoa and helminths. The changes in key indicators between the baseline and end‐line surveys were analysed by mixed logistic and linear regression models. RESULTS: Stunting was slightly lowered in SG+ (19.9 to 18.3%; p = 0.92) and in the control (19.7 to 18.9%). Anaemia slightly decreased in SG+ (33.0 to 32.0%; p < 0.01) and markedly increased in the control (22.7 to 41.3%; p < 0.01), a minor decline was found in the control (43.9 to 42.4%). Handwashing with soap before eating strongly increased in SG+ (from 74.1 to 96.9%; p = 0.01, compared to control where only a slight increase was observed from 78.0 to 84.0%). A similar observation was made for handwashing after defecation (increase from 77.2 to 99.0% in SG+ versus 78.0 to 91.9% in control, p = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: An integrated intervention consisting of school garden, WASH, nutrition and health components (SG+) increased children's fruit and vegetable consumption, decreased intestinal parasitic infections and improved hygiene behaviours.

"Incorporating incubation period distributions to precisely estimate the association between rainfall and Legionella infection","Cassell, K; Warren, JL; Heneghan, C; Weinberger, DM","Journal of infectious diseases","10.1093/infdis/jiae625","231","6","2025","BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have shown a positive relationship between weather events and, 1 to 2 weeks later, Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases. Narrowing this time window of association can help determine whether the mechanism linking rainfall and relative humidity to sporadic LD is direct or indirect. Due to the large number of daily water interactions and low incidence of LD, we propose a new Bayesian modeling approach to disentangle the potential for a direct versus indirect exposure to precipitation. METHODS: Incubation period distributions were used to redistribute LD cases to their estimated day of exposure. Then Bayesian distributed lag models were fit to estimate cases per day of exposure with predictor variables for rainfall and absolute humidity. Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of relatively humidity, rainfall after the estimated date of exposure, and randomized rainfall to validate our results. RESULTS: One standard deviation increase in rainfall 2 and 3 days prior to the date of estimated exposure was associated with an approximately 15% increase in LD risk (per day). When heavy rainfall occurred 0 to 3 days prior to estimated exposure, risk increased by more than 40%, peaking at a 51% increased risk of LD 2 days after heavy rainfall. DISCUSSION: Our findings of a 2‐ and 3‐day lag between rainfall and the date of estimated exposure is consistent with an indirect link with rainfall, rather than a same‐day exposure. Potential pathways that can indirectly link rainfall to LD cases include rainfall‐mediated declines in public water supplies, but greater environmental sampling research is needed."
"Improved WASH Knowledge and Practices, and Reduced Water Contamination Through Social Behavior Change, in Uganda","Moore, I; Griswold, S; Van Sant, C; Lantagne, D; Heylen, C; Fitzpatrick, M; Birungi, C; Marshak, A; Mwesigire, T; Bagabirwa, J; Schoenmakers, K; Webb, P; Ghosh, S","Current developments in nutrition","10.1016/j.cdnut.2023.100945","7",NA,"2023","Objectives: Poor water quality and hygiene practices contribute to diarrheal disease which can impair growth and development, increasing risk of stunting and wasting among children under‐2. This study evaluates the impact of a social behavior change communication (SBCC) program on water quality and hygiene practices in northern Uganda. Methods: A three‐arm cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) ‐ the One Nutrition in Complex Environments (ONCE) study ‐ evaluated the Nutrition Impact and Positive Practice (NIPP) program and an enhanced (NIPP+) program with added exposure to WASH and agricultural technologies compared to controls in households with children under‐2. Data were collected pre‐ and post‐intervention for 3 arms (n=900). Water was collected at households and community sources on a random subsample (n=360). E. coli were quantified with membrane filtration (CFU/100 mL) and converted to a binary indicator (<=10 | >10 CFU/ 100 ml).We computed an overall WASH score (out of 13) with 13 positive WASH indicators. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to generate effect estimates, adjusting for social‐demographic characteristics,water source characteristics and contamination, and baseline contamination. Results: NIPP and NIPP+ participants had higher probability of boiling water, cleaning water containers, and having a hand washing facility compared to controls at endline. They also had higher cumulative WASH knowledge and practice scores. There was no difference in effects by socioeconomic status or education. Therewas no significant difference in risk of E. coli contamination for NIPP compared to control. However, NIPP+ had a 24% lower risk (RR=0.76; p=0.02) of having E. coli in water compared to control. If all households had the NIPP+ intervention, fewer (49%) would have E. coli contaminated water than with no intervention (64%). Conclusions: Improvements in WASH knowledge and practices were reported for intervention households, along with a reduced risk of E. coli for NIPP+. While the NIPP+ intervention reduced contamination, about 50% of NIPP+ households still used contaminated water. Further analysis to determine the specific aspects responsible for contamination risk reduction and subsequent effects on malnutrition is needed.

We examined the impact of an urban WASH in schools programme (Project WISE) on child health and attendance. Methods The WISE cluster‐randomised trial, conducted in 60 public primary schools in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia over one academic year, enrolled 2–4 randomly selected classes per school (approximately 100 pupils) from grades 2–8 (aged 7–16) in an 'open cohort'. Schools were assigned 1:1 by stratified randomisation to receive the intervention during the 2021/22 academic year or the 2022/23 academic year (waitlist control). Masking was not possible. The intervention included improvements to drinking water storage, filtration and access, alongside handwashing stations and behaviour change promotion. Planned improvements to sanitation facilities were not realised. At four unannounced classroom visits between March and June 2022 (post‐intervention, approximately every four weeks), enumerators recorded primary outcomes of roll‐call absence, and pupil‐reported respiratory illness and diarrhoea in the past seven days among pupils present. Analysis was by intention‐to‐treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT05024890. Findings Of 83 eligible schools, 60 were randomly selected and assigned. In total, 6229 eligible pupils were enrolled (median per school 101·5; IQR 94–112), with 5987 enrolled at study initiation (23rd November–22nd December 2021) and the remaining 242 during follow‐up. Data were available on roll‐call absence for 6166 pupils (99·0%), and on pupil‐reported illness for 6145 pupils (98·6%). We observed a 16% relative reduction in the odds of pupil‐reported respiratory illness in the past seven days during follow‐up in intervention schools vs. control schools (aOR 0·84; 95% CI 0·71–1·00; p=0·046). No effect was observed on pupil‐reported diarrhoea in the past seven days (aOR 1·15; 95% CI 0·84–1·59; p=0·39) nor roll‐call absence (aOR 1·07; 95% 0·83–1·38; p=0·59). There was a small increase in menstrual care self‐efficacy (aMD 3·32 on 0–100 scale; 95% CI 0·05–6·59), and no effects on the other health, wellbeing and absence secondary outcomes."
"The Impact of Chlorinated Drinking Water Exposure on Gut Microbiota Development in Infants: a Randomised Controlled Trial","Parkin, K; Christophersen, CT; Verhasselt, V; Palmer, DJ; Cooper, MN; Prescott, SL; Silva, D; Martino, D","medRxiv: the preprint server for health sciences","10.1101/2024.09.15.24313601",NA,NA,"2024","Background: Early gut microbiota disruptions can increase the risk for dysbiosis and predispose to chronic diseases. While chlorinated drinking water is generally considered safe, the antimicrobial effects of chlorine‐based disinfectants may negatively impact the developing infant microbiota, which is particularly vulnerable during this critical period. This study investigates the specific effects of chlorinated water on the gut microbiome in infants. Methods: The waTer qUality and Microbiome Study (TUMS) is a double‐blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). Six‐month old infants (n=197) received either de‐chlorinated drinking water (via benchtop filtration), or regular tap water for twelve months. Stool samples were collected at six‐months (baseline) and at eighteen‐months of age. Metagenomic sequencing was used for faecal microbiome analysis. Samples of participant tap water was also collected pre‐ and post‐intervention. Results: Participants were balanced for sex, delivery method, and breast‐feeding status at time of recruitment between the control (n=98) and treatment (n=99) groups. We collected a total of 170 baseline stool samples (83 in the control group and 87 in the treatment group), and 130 follow‐up stool samples (65 in the control group and 65 in the treatment group). Interindividual variation was higher at six‐months compared to eighteen months. No significant differences in overall community structure (beta diversity (p=0.35), richness (p=0.98) or Shannon Index (p=0.45)) were found between treatment groups. However, 55 genera were differentially abundant at follow‐up (adjusted p‐value < 0.01), primarily within the Firmicutes phylum. Analysis of metabolic pathways revealed the chlorinated water group showed significantly higher abundance of antibiotic resistance genes mostly attributable to Escherichia and Klebsiella species. Conclusion: Water chlorination induces predominantly minor changes in infant gut microbiome composition; but appears to increase the abundance of antibiotic‐resistant genes. While water chlorination remains a vital public health tool for ensuring safe drinking water, our findings underscore the need for continued research into the potential for increased antibiotic resistance and suggest there may be value in exploring alternative disinfectant strategies."
"Digestive tolerability and acceptability of Fibersol-2 in healthy and diarrheal children 1-3 years old at a rural facility, Bangladesh: results from a four arm exploratory study","Shahid, ASMSB; Ahmed, S; Renesa, TT; Onni, AT; Dash, S; Kishimoto, Y; Kanahori, S; Ahmed, T; Faruque, ASG; Chisti, MJ","PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0274302","17","9","2022","BACKGROUND: Fibersol‐2 has some beneficial effects on human health. We aimed to evaluate the digestive tolerability and acceptability of Fibersol‐2 in healthy and diarrheal children, as well as improvement in stool consistencies in young diarrheal children. METHODS: Sixty children of either sex, aged 1‐3 years having four groups (healthy children/low dose, healthy children/high dose, children with diarrhea/low dose and children with diarrhea/high dose) were enrolled into this exploratory study between 1st August to 23rd October 2017. Two presumptive doses, low (2.5g) and high (5g), twice daily with 50 ml drinking water for seven days were the interventions. Outcomes were to observe the development of possible abdominal symptoms, such as pain, distension, rumbling, and bloating during the intervention and post‐intervention periods in healthy and diarrheal children as well as improvement in stool consistencies in diarrheal children. RESULTS: Among the diarrheal children, the median (IQR) duration of resolution of diarrhea was 3.9 (2.9, 5.1) days vs. 3.5 (2.0, 8.0) days, p = 0.885; in low dose and high dose groups, respectively. Significant difference was observed in terms of abdominal pain (27% vs. 7%, p = 0.038) and distension (40% vs. 0%, p<0.001) in diarrheal children, compared to healthy children during the pre‐intervention period. We also observed significant difference in respect of abdominal distension (23% vs. 0%, p = 0.011), rumbling (27% vs. 0%, p = 0.005) and bloating (43% vs. 3%, p = 0.001) in diarrheal children, compared to healthy children during the intervention period. However, no significant difference was observed in relation to abdominal pain (p = 0.347) and distension (p = 0.165) during the pre‐intervention period, compared to the intervention period in diarrheal children. Moreover, no significant difference was observed during the post‐intervention period for the diarrheal and healthy children. CONCLUSION: Fibersol‐2 was found to be well tolerated in healthy and diarrheal children aged 1‐3 years.

METHODS: Analysis of patient‐level data from 2 multicenter randomized, placebo controlled trials conducted in pediatric emergency departments in Canada and the United States. Participants were 3‐48 months with >3 diarrheal episodes in the preceding 24 hours and were symptomatic for <72 hours and <7 days in the Canadian and US studies, respectively. Participants received either placebo or a probiotic preparation (Canada‐Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011/Lactobacillus helveticus R0052; US‐L. rhamnosus GG). The primary outcome was post‐intervention moderate‐to‐severe disease (ie, ≥9 on the Modified Vesikari Scale [MVS] score). RESULTS: Pathogens were identified in specimens from 59.3% of children (928/1565). No pathogen groups were less likely to experience an MVS score ≥9 based on treatment allocation (test for interaction = 0.35). No differences between groups were identified for adenovirus (adjusted relative risk [aRR]: 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI]: .62, 3.23), norovirus (aRR: 0.98; 95% CI: .56, 1.74), rotavirus (aRR: 0.86; 95% CI: .43, 1.71) or bacteria (aRR: 1.19; 95% CI: .41, 3.43). At pathogen‐group and among individual pathogens there were no differences in diarrhea duration or the total number of diarrheal stools between treatment groups, regardless of intervention allocation or among probiotic sub‐groups. Among adenovirus‐infected children, those administered the L. rhamnosus R0011/L. helveticus R0052 product experienced fewer diarrheal episodes (aRR: 0.65; 95% CI: .47, .90). CONCLUSIONS: Neither probiotic product resulted in less severe disease compared to placebo across a range of the most common etiologic pathogens. The preponderance of evidence does not support the notion that there are pathogen specific benefits associated with probiotic use in children with acute gastroenteritis.

"Study of some risk factors for fungal contamination of dental unit waterlines in Alexandria, Egypt","Omran, EAH; Abbass, AAG; Abaza, AF; Elzouki, EM","Journal of infection in developing countries","10.3855/jidc.13810","15","8","2021","Introduction: Monitoring the microbial quality of water in dental unit waterlines is an important part of infection control measures carried out in dental clinics. Fungal contamination of such waterlines has not been extensively studied, compared with bacterial contamination. This study aimed at assessing the magnitude and risk factors for fungal contamination of dental unit waterlines. Methodology: This cross‐sectional study included 82 dental units, randomly collected from 3 private clinics and 8 governmental hospitals in Alexandria, Egypt. A total of 204 water samples from dental unit waterlines output were membrane‐filtered and cultured for fungal enumeration and species identification. The biofilm forming‐ability was assessed for the most prevalent fungal species. The acceptability of samples was determined according to the Swedish drinking water guidelines. Results: The acceptability of samples was 89.7%. The most common mould was Aspergillus flavus, while Candida spp. was the most common yeast (10 isolates), with unusual predominance of Candida dubliniensis (9 isolates). All isolates of Aspergillus flavus and Candida dubliniensis were biofilm‐formers. The risk factors for fungal contamination of dental unit waterlines included: Dental specialty (p = 0.042), time of sample collection (p < 0.001), older age of dental unit (p < 0.001) and use of 5‐15% of sodium hypochlorite. Conclusions: The presence of biofilm‐forming fungi in dental unit waterlines is a potential hazard, even when samples have acceptable levels of fungal counts. Risk factors for contamination are numerous and should be addressed."
"Concurrent anemia and stunting among schoolchildren in Wonago district in southern Ethiopia: a cross-sectional multilevel analysis","Amare, HH; Lindtjorn, B","PeerJ","10.7717/peerj.11158","9",NA,"2021","Background. Even if many schoolchildren in Ethiopia are anemic and stunted, few have studied the co‐existence of anemia and stunting among schoolchildren in Ethiopia. In addition, multilevel analysis to explore the variation in prevalence of concurrent anemia and stunting (CAS) across schools and classes is rarely applied. Thus, we aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of CAS at the individual, household, and school level among schoolchildren in southern Ethiopia. Methods. We recruited 864 students aged 7–14 years from the Wonago district in southern Ethiopia using a three‐stage random sampling, assigning four schools to level one, 24 classes to level two. We then randomly selected 36 children from each class, and recorded their weight, height, haemoglobin, intestinal helminthic infections, hygienic practices, dietary practices, household food insecurity, and socio‐demographic information. A multivariate, multilevel logistic regression model was applied to detect potential risk factors for CAS. Results. The prevalence of CAS was 10.5% (85/810) among schoolchildren, which increased with age in years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.39 [95% confidence interval 1.13, 1.71, P = 0.002]) and among children who always did not wash their hands with soap after use of latrine (aOR 4.30 [1.21, 15.3, P = 0.02]). Children who walked barefoot (aOR 10.4 [2.77, 39.1, P = 0.001]), were infected with Trichuris trichiura (aOR 1.74 [1.05, 2.88, P = 0.03]), or had head lice infestation (aOR 1.71 [1.01, 2.92, P = 0.04]) had higher CAS prevalence. Prevalence rates of CAS were low in those using treated drinking water (aOR 0.32 [95% CI 0.11, 0.97, P = 0.04]). Most of the risk factors for CAS were identified at the individual level. The clustering effect measured by the intra‐cluster correlation coefficient was 6.8% at school level and 19% at class. Conclusion. CAS prevalence is a moderate public health problem among schoolchildren in southern Ethiopia and varies across classes and schools. After controlling for clustering effects at the school and class levels, we found an association between CAS and increasing age, not always washing hands with soap after using latrine, walking barefoot, and T. trichiura infection. Using treated water for drinking was found to have a protective effect against CAS. Thus, educating children on personal hygiene and provision of safe drinking water could reduce the CAS burden in schoolchildren in rural areas of southern Ethiopia."
"Antibiotic use and hygiene interact to influence the distribution of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in low-income communities in Guatemala","Ramay, BM; Caudell, MA; Cordón-Rosales, C; Archila, LD; Palmer, GH; Jarquin, C; Moreno, P; McCracken, JP; Rosenkrantz, L; Amram, O; Omulo, S; Call, DR","Scientific reports","10.1038/s41598-020-70741-4","10","1","2020","To examine the effects of poor sanitation and hygiene on the prevalence of antimicrobial‐resistant bacteria, we surveyed households in two rural and two urban communities in Guatemala (N = 196 randomly selected households). One adult (≥ 18‐years old) and, when available, one child (≤ 5 years‐old) provided a stool sample. Up to 48 presumptive Escherichia coli isolates were collected from each stool sample (n = 21,256 total) and were subjected to breakpoint assays for ten antibiotics. Mixed‐effects logistic models were used to identify potential factors influencing the likelihood of harboring antibiotic‐resistant bacteria. For nine out of ten antibiotics, the odds of detecting resistant bacteria decreased by   32% (odds ratios, OR 0.53‐0.8, P < 0.001) for every unit of improvement of a hygiene scale. Hygiene differences between households had a greater impact on prevalence compared to antibiotic use differences. The likelihood of detecting resistant isolates was lower for five antibiotics among households that boiled raw milk before consumption (OR 0.31‐0.69), and higher for nine antibiotics in urban households (OR > 1.89‐9.6). Poor hygiene conditions likely obscure effects of individual antibiotic use, presumably due to enhanced microbial transmission. Consequently, efforts to improve antibiotic stewardship should be coupled with improving hygiene conditions."

This study was aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of E. coli O157:H7 related to diarrhea among under‐five children with acute diarrhea. Methods A cross‐sectional study design was carried out in 2018 on 378 under‐five‐year children recruited randomly from hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia. Stool specimens were collected and processed using enrichment, differential and selective medium. Among isolates, E. coli O157:H7 was confirmed using latex test (Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hants, England). Factors associated with E. coli O157:H7 infection were identified using binary and multivariable logistic regression. Associations were reported by odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Results The prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 related diarrhea was 15.3% (95%CI: 11.8–19.5). The E. coli O157:H7 infection was positively associated with rural residence (AOR;3.75, 95% CI:1.26–11.20), consumption of undercooked meat (AOR;3.95, 95%CI: 1.23–12.67), raw vegetables and/or fruit juice (AOR;3.37, 95%CI:1.32–8.62), presence of bloody diarrhea (AOR;4.42, 95% CI:1.78–10.94), number of under‐five children in a household (AOR;7.16, 95%CI: 2.90–17.70), presence of person with diarrhea in a household (AOR;4.22, 95% CI: 1.84–12.69), owning domestic animal (AOR;3.87, 95% CI: 1.48–10.12) and uneducated mother (AOR;3.14, 95%CI: 1.05–9.42). Conclusion The Prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 related diarrhea among under‐five children is relatively high in Eastern Ethiopia. The E. coli infection was associated with sanitation and hygiene in a household. Thus, education focused on food cooking and handling, child care, and household sanitation associated with animal manure in rural resident children are helpful in."
"A factorial cluster-randomised controlled trial combining home-environmental and early child development interventions to improve child health and development: rationale, trial design and baseline findings","Hartinger, SM; Nuño, N; Hattendorf, J; Verastegui, H; Karlen, W; Ortiz, M; Mäusezahl, D","BMC medical research methodology","10.1186/s12874-020-00950-y","20","1","2020","BACKGROUND: Exposure to unhealthy environments and inadequate child stimulation are main risk factors that affect children's health and wellbeing in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Interventions that simultaneously address several risk factors at the household level have great potential to reduce these negative effects. We present the design and baseline findings of a cluster‐randomised controlled trial to evaluate the impact of an integrated home‐environmental intervention package and an early child development programme to improve diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections and childhood developmental outcomes in children under 36 months of age living in resource‐limited rural Andean Peru. METHODS: We collected baseline data on children's developmental performance, health status and demography as well as microbial contamination in drinking water. In a sub‐sample of households, we measured indoor kitchen 24‐h air concentration levels of carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and CO for personal exposure. RESULTS: We recruited and randomised 317 children from 40 community‐clusters to four study arms. At baseline, all arms had similar health and demographic characteristics, and the developmental status of children was comparable between arms. The analysis revealed that more than 25% of mothers completed primary education, a large proportion of children were stunted and diarrhoea prevalence was above 18%. Fifty‐two percent of drinking water samples tested positive for thermo‐tolerant coliforms and the occurrence of E.coli was evenly distributed between arms. The mean levels of kitchen PM2.5 and CO concentrations were 213 μg/m3 and 4.8 ppm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The trial arms are balanced with respect to most baseline characteristics, such as household air and water pollution, and child development. These results ensure the possible estimation of the trial effectiveness. This trial will yield valuable information for assessing synergic, rational and cost‐effective benefits of the combination of home‐based interventions. TRIAL REGISTRY: ISRCTN‐26548981."

In this study, we measured the impact of a sanitation intervention (dual‐pit latrines, sani‐scoops, child potties delivered as part of a randomized control trial, WASH Benefits) in rural Bangladeshi household compounds by assessing prevalence ratios, differences, and changes in the concentration of pathogen genes and host‐specific fecal markers. We found no difference in the prevalence of pathogenic Escherichia coli, norovirus, or Giardia genes in the domestic environment in the sanitation and control arms. The prevalence of the human fecal marker was lower on child hands and the concentration of animal fecal marker was lower on mother hands in the sanitation arm in adjusted models, but these associations were not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. In the subset of households with ≥10 individuals per compound, the prevalence of enterotoxigenic E. coli genes on child hands was lower in the sanitation arm. Incomplete removal of child and animal feces or the compound (versus community‐wide) scale of intervention could explain the limited impacts of improved sanitation."

This may lead to the occurrence of various foodborne illnesses through the introduction of pathogenic microbes during prepara‐tion and serving of food. Objective: To determine the effect of microbial quality of washing water on the hand hygiene status of food handlers in Jimma town. Methods: Laboratory‐based cross‐sectional study design was used. A total of 150 food handlers were selected randomly for hand hygiene examination, and 150 water samples were collected aseptically from water storage tanks, food handlers used to wash their hands. The samples were subjected for microbiological analysis using standardized proto‐col. Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation coefficient were used to summarize the data and to determine the effect of microbial quality of water on hand hygiene of food handlers, respectively. Results: Among 150 food handlers included in the study, 104 (69.0%) of them were males and 64 (43.0%) of them aged between 35 and 50 years. On the other hand, 64 (42.7%) of the study participants had not attended formal education. About three‐fourth of them used stored water to wash their hands, and almost similar proportion of them were waiters. The mean coliform bacteria of water and hand rinsate samples were 4.2 ± 0.8 and 4.1 ± 0.8 log CFU/mL, respectively. Conclusion: The study revealed that the microbial quality of water used to wash hands significantly affects the hand hygiene status of the food handlers. Hence, improving the microbial quality of washing water is important to improve the hand hygiene status of food handlers and consequently to prevent the occurrence of food‐borne illness in the town."

Observational studies have revealed associations between household flooring and health outcomes, but robust experimental evidence is scant. This study will evaluate the impact of an improved household flooring intervention on enteric infections, soil‐transmitted helminth (STH) infections and tungiasis through implementation of a cluster‐randomised trial in two rural settings in Kwale and Bungoma Counties, Kenya. METHODS AND ANALYSES: 440 clusters (households) across both sites are allocated to control or intervention group, in which a low‐cost, sealed, washable, cement‐based floor is installed in eligible buildings of the dwelling, alongside a floor‐care guide provided during an induction meeting. Following baseline assessments in both groups, all individuals over 1 year receive albendazole and those infected with tungiasis receive benzyl benzoate. Primary outcomes are as follows: prevalence of enteric infections in children under 5 years assessed via stool surveys and PCR; prevalence of tungiasis infection in children 1‐14 years based on clinical exam; and prevalence of STH infection in all household members over 1 year assessed via Kato‐Katz. Secondary outcomes include the following: intensity of STH and tungiasis infections; prevalence of caregiver‐reported gastrointestinal illness in children under 5; quality of life and well‐being measures; and environmental contamination. A process evaluation investigates intervention acceptability, durability, practicality and cost. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has been approved by ethics committees of The Kenya Medical Research Institute, The Kenya National Commission for Science Technology and Innovation, and The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Following the 12‐month implementation period and final assessments, control households are offered improved floors. Results will be disseminated within Kenya, to the Ministries of Health and of Lands, Public Works, Housing and Urban Development, and to subnational leadership and communities. Dissemination will also occur through publications and conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05914363."

However, achieving high adoption and sustained use of safe storage is challenging. Systematic adaptation can address these challenges by improving contextual fit while retaining core functionality to protect water quality. We applied Plan‐Do‐Study‐Act (PDSA) cycles to systematically adapt a safe water storage container (SWSC) intervention for implementation in rural Burkina Faso. This study describes the adaptation process and the impacts of the SWSC on Escherichia coli contamination in household stored water in a cluster‐randomized trial with 49 intervention villages (274 households) and 50 no‐intervention control villages (290 households). SWSC adoption among intervention households was high (88.9%). The intervention achieved approximately a 0.4 log reduction in E. coli contamination. Intervention impact was likely moderated by differential changes in improved source use across intervention and control households. Safe storage improves water quality when used consistently. PDSA frameworks can guide the adaptation of safe storage interventions to optimize adoption and sustained use in new contexts while preserving core functions that protect water quality."
"Employing patient‑centric health education for the prevention of parasitic infections","Khanna, V; Khanna, R; Chandrashekar, UK; Ashok, L","Tropical parasitology","10.4103/tp.tp_27_23","14","2","2024","Background: Soil‐transmitted infections such as Ascaris lumbricoides, Hookworm, Trichuris trichiura, and Strongyloides stercoralis are common in South India. Factors such as diet, sanitation, and living conditions play a role in the prevalence of helminthic diseases. Many individuals remain asymptomatic carriers. Timely intervention is essential to prevent these infections. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective, randomized intervention study that enrolled 52 participants, excluding children, all of whom had parasitic infections. A prevalidated questionnaire was given to assess the risk factors for parasitic diseases, and fecal examinations were conducted to identify parasitic infestations. The World Health Organization’s hand hygiene self‐assessment framework was used to evaluate handwashing skills. Subsequent posttesting and resampling of patients allowed for score comparison, assessment of reductions in parasitic load, determination of cure rates, and monitoring of patient readmission rates. Results: After the health education intervention, a statistically significant improvement (P < 0.01) was observed in patients’ knowledge and attitudes toward parasitic infections, as shown by their posttest scores compared to their pretest scores. In addition, there were notable improvements in handwashing skills following the implementation of the handwashing educational program. Conclusion: This research confirms that health education is vital in promoting proper hand hygiene, reducing parasitic infections, and urging timely medical care for these conditions."

Therefore, WASH mHealth programs present a promising approach to improve WASH behaviors. The Preventative‐Intervention‐for‐Cholera‐for‐7‐days (PICHA7) program is a targeted WASH intervention using a combination of mHealth and in‐person visits delivered to diarrhea patient households in DRC to reduce diarrheal diseases. Methods: During the randomized controlled trial (RCT) of PICHA7, 1196 participants received weekly voice, interactive voice response (IVR) quiz, and text messages from the PICHA7 mHealth program over the 12‐month program period. Outcome indicators included % of unique text, voice, and IVR messages received (fidelity) and % of unique messages fully listened to (dose) assessed using the engageSPARK mobile message platform, and program reach to households assessed through monthly follow‐up visits. Results: Overall, 84% of program households received unique text messages and 90% of unique voice and IVR messages were answered. Program households reported receiving a PICHA7 mHealth message in the past two weeks at 72% of surveillance visits (844/1177). Seventy‐four percent (309/418) of participants reported sharing a PICHA7 mHealth message with another person at least once during the study period. Conclusion: These findings show high fidelity, dose, and reach of mobile message delivery in the PICHA7 mHealth program. This study demonstrates the feasibility of delivering the PICHA7 mHealth program in eastern DRC and provides important insights for delivering WASH mHealth programing in low‐ and middle‐income countries globally."
"Probiotics for intestinal decolonization of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae: a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial","Ljungquist, O; Kampmann, C; Resman, F; Riesbeck, K; Tham, J","Clinical microbiology and infection","10.1016/j.cmi.2019.08.019","26","4","2020","OBJECTIVES: Infections with extended spectrum β‐lactamase (ESBL)‐producing Enterobacteriaceae (EPE) are a major healthcare concern. Our goal was to investigate whether a probiotic mixture could be used for eradication therapy in patients with prolonged intestinal EPE carriage. METHODS: We performed a randomized, placebo‐controlled, single‐blinded clinical superiority trial in the south of Sweden between February 2017 and April 2019. Probiotic Vivomixx®, a mixture of 8 different living bacterial strains or placebo was given to adult outpatients intestinally colonized for at least 3 months with EPE. Patients with suspected active infections at the time of evaluation were excluded, and also those with immunosuppression, severe psychiatric disorder, drug abuse or dementia. Each patient in the probiotic arm was administered 2 sachets (9.0 × 1011 live bacteria) twice daily for 2 months. The primary outcome was intestinal EPE eradication at the end of the 1‐year follow‐up, as shown by 3 consecutive negative EPE rectal swabs during the follow‐up year. The per protocol follow‐up for all patients was 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the initiation of the intervention. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03860415. RESULTS: In total, the target size of 80 patients were included. The median age was 68 years in both groups. The number of females in the probiotics group was 23 (58%) and in the placebo group 28 (70%). At the end of the trial, 12.5% (5 out of 40) of the patients in the probiotic group had achieved successful eradication of EPE, as defined by the primary outcome, in the intention to treat analysis. In the placebo group, 5% (2 out of 40) of the patients had achieved successful eradication of EPE (odds ratio 2.71; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.49‐14.9; p 0.24). CONCLUSIONS: Successful EPE eradication was observed in very few individuals. This trial did not support Vivomixx® as being superior to placebo for intestinal decolonization in adult patients with chronic colonization of EPE, but was limited in power."
"Prevalence of opportunistic intestinal parasitic infections among hiv/aids patients before and after commencement of antiretroviral treatment at felege hiwot referral hospital: a follow-up study","Getachew, T; Hailu, T; Alemu, M","HIV/AIDS - research and palliative care","10.2147/HIV.S318538","13",NA,"2021","Background: Coccidian parasites are opportunistic intestinal parasites that cause diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals. Although the impacts of coccidian infection are significant among HIV/AIDS infected cases, proper diagnosis and management of coccidian infection is limited in sub‐Saharan Africa including Ethiopia. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of coccidian parasitic infections among HIV/AIDS cases before and after commencement of antiretroviral treatment. Methods: An institution‐based longitudinal study was conducted among 304 randomly selected HIV/AIDS cases from February to July 2018 before and after commencement of antiretroviral therapy. A structured questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic and associated factors data. Stool and blood samples were collected before and three months after treatment. Coccidian detection and CD4+ count were conducted via modified acid fast stain technique and fluorescence‐activated cell scanning, respectively. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics were used to compute coccidian prevalence. Logistic regression was used to compute possible association between associated factors and coccidian parasitic infection. Variables with P<0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results: Among 304 HIV/AIDS cases, prevalence of coccidian parasitic infection before and after antiretroviral treatment was 23.4% and 8.9%, respectively. Prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. (19.7%) and Isospora belli (4.3%) before antiretroviral treatment were higher than Cryptosporidium spp. (7.9%) and Isospora belli (1.0%) after treatment. Drinking unprotected water (AOR: 7.41; 95%CI: 1.64–33.45), poor knowledge of HIV/AIDS and coccidian parasite (AOR: 4.19; 95%CI: 1.69–10.40), and CD4+ count below 200 cells/mm3 (AOR: 62.49; 95%CI: 25.32–154.21) were significantly associated with coccidian infection. Conclusion: Prevalence of coccidian parasites among HIV/AIDS cases decreases after antire‐troviral treatment. Drinking unsafe water, limited knowledge of HIV/AIDS and coccidian parasite and low CD4+ cell count are factors associated with coccidian infection. Therefore, proper detection and treatment of coccidian parasites among HIV/AIDS cases should be prioritized."
"Impact of synbiotics on gut microbiota during early life: a randomized, double-blind study","Phavichitr, N; Wang, S; Chomto, S; Tantibhaedhyangkul, R; Kakourou, A; Intarakhao, S; Jongpiputvanich, S; Roeselers, G; Knol, J","Scientific reports","10.1038/s41598-021-83009-2","11","1","2021","Human milk is considered the optimal nutrition for infants and found to contain significant numbers of viable bacteria. The aim of the study was to assess the effects of a specific synbiotic combination at doses closer to the bacterial cells present in human milk, on intestinal bifidobacteria proportions (relative abundance), reduction of potential pathogens and gut physiological conditions. A clinical study was conducted in 290 healthy infants aged from 6 to 19 weeks. Infants received either a control infant formula or one of the two investigational infant formulas (control formula with 0.8 g/100 ml scGOS/lcFOS and Bifidobacterium breve M‐16V at either 1 × 104 cfu/ml or 1 × 106 cfu/ml). Exclusively breastfed infants were included as a reference. Analyses were performed on intention‐to‐treat groups and all‐subjects‐treated groups. After 6 weeks of intervention, the synbiotics at two different doses significantly increased the bifidobacteria proportions in healthy infants. The synbiotic supplementation also decreased the prevalence (infants with detectable levels) and the abundance of C. difficile. Closer to the levels in the breastfed reference group, fecal pH was significantly lower while L‐lactate concentrations and acetate proportions were significantly higher in the synbiotic groups. All formulas were well tolerated and all groups showed a comparable safety profile based on the number and severity of adverse events and growth. In healthy infants, supplementation of infant‐type bifidobacterial strain B. breve M‐16V, at a dose close to bacterial numbers found in human milk, with scGOS/lcFOS (9:1) created a gut environment closer to the breastfed reference group. This specific synbiotic mixture may also support gut microbiota resilience during early life.Clinical Trial Registration This clinical study named Color Synbiotics Study, was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov on 18 March 2013.

Leading to significant negative effect on patients' quality of life and huge financial burden to health system, the management of IBS is a great challenge. Probiotics are considered as an effective therapy; however, in a lack of high‐quality evidence of efficacy, no strain‐ and dose‐specific probiotics were recommended in clinical guidelines. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the Bifidobacterium quadruple viable tablet in the treatment of IBS‐D. Methods/design: A multicenter randomized controlled trial will be performed in fourteen hospitals. A total of three hundred patients who fulfill the eligibility criteria will be stratified divided into an experimental group and a control group randomly in a ratio of 1:1. The experimental group is treated with the Bifidobacterium quadruple viable tablet while the control group is treated with placebo. All the patients will receive a 4‐week treatment and a 2‐week follow‐up. The primary outcome is the effectiveness in improving abdominal pain and stool consistency; the secondary outcome includes evaluation of overall symptom relief, frequency of defecation, bloating, urgency of defecation, remedial medication, score of IBS‐QOL, and changes of microbiota and metabonomics. Physical examination, vital signs, laboratory tests, adverse events, and concomitant medication will be taken into account for intervention safety assessment during the trial. Discussion: This multicenter randomized controlled trial may provide high‐quality evidence on the efficacy of the Bifidobacterium quadruple viable tablet for IBS‐D on both physical and mental dimensions in China. To fill the gap of previous probiotic intervention studies, in addition, this study will also present safety assessment which will be a significant emphasis. Trial registration: ChiCTR1800017721.

"Assessment of prevalence and risk factors for intestinal parasitosis, malnutrition, and anemia among school children in Ghindae area, Eritrea","Kesete, Y; Tesfahiwet, H; Fessehaye, G; Kidane, Y; Tekle, Y; Yacob, A; Seltene, B","Journal of tropical medicine","10.1155/2020/4230260","2020",NA,"2020","Background. Research studies on determination of risk factors for intestinal parasitic infections and related malnutrition and anemia in various tropical areas are necessary for appropriate preventive resource allocation and cost effective control. This study is aimed at evaluating the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal parasitosis, malnutrition, and anemia amongst elementary and junior school students in Ghindae area, Eritrea. Method. A cross‐sectional study was conducted in 6 schools around Ghindae from February to April 2018. 460 children were selected randomly for analysis and consent was taken from guardians. The pertinent sociodemographic data was collected using a pretested questionnaire, and anthropometric measurements were carried out to determine the proportion of students with malnutrition, stunting, and thinness. Fecal samples were examined by formal‐ether concentration technique, and blood specimen was collected and analyzed for the assessment of hemoglobin using Hemocue analyzers. The association between predictors and outcome variables were measured with a stepwise logistic regression model. Result. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was 45.3%. Protozoan infections (38.2%) were more prevalent than soil‐transmitted helminthic infections (10.4%). The presence of different intestinal parasitic infections had statistically significant association with the residence area, hand washing habits, source of drinking water, and type of latrine used. The prevalence of malnutrition was 36.9% with 18.5% stunting and 21.2% thinness. Students of rural areas had 2.03 times more odds of having malnutrition. The current prevalence of anemia was 12.4%, out of which 7.6% had mild anemia while 4.4% of them had moderate anemia and 0.4% were severely anemic. Conclusion. The prevalence of parasitic infection among school‐age children in Ghindae area was high. Unsafe drinking water sources from streams and springs were among the core problems for increased prevalence along with decreased awareness on personal hygienic and sanitation practices. Undernutrition was widely prevalent among students in Ghindae area. Height for age and BMI for age scores of all participants were found to be below the WHO growth standards. Malnutrition was in higher prevalence in rural areas outside Ghindae, which is attributed to two times higher odds than their counterparts. The magnitude of anemia found in this study is considered a mild public health problem."

To reduce the prevalence of these diseases, effective interventions for adequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) should be implemented. This paper describes the design of a cluster‐randomized controlled trial that will compare the efficacy of four school‐based WaSH interventions for improving children’s health literacy, handwashing, and nutrition. Interventions consisted of (1) WaSH policy reinforcement; (2) low‐, medium‐, or high‐volume health education; (3) hygiene supplies; and (4) WaSH facilities (e.g., toilets, urinals, handwashing basins) improvements. We randomly allocated school clusters from the intervention arm to one of four groups to compare with schools from the control arm. Primary outcomes were: children’s health literacy, physical growth, nutrition status, and handwashing prevalence. Secondary outcomes were: children’s self‐reported health status and history of extreme hunger, satisfaction with WaSH facilities, and school restrooms’ WaSH adequacy. We will measure differences in pre‐and post‐intervention outcomes and compare these differences between control and intervention arms. This research protocol can be a blueprint for future school‐based WaSH intervention studies to be conducted in LMICs. Study protocols were approved by the ethics committees of the University of Bonn, Germany, and the University of the Philippines Manila.

The objective of the study was to determine the risk factors of HAV infection in the Gampha District in Sri Lanka. METHODS: This was an unmatched case control study conducted between January 2015 and November 2016 comprising of 504 participants with a case control ratio of 1:1. The study population included individuals of age 1 year and above who were permanent residents of the district. Cases included participants admitted to four secondary care state hospitals with an acute HAV diagnosed by detecting serum anti‐HAV IgM antibodies. Controls were randomly selected individuals from the community with serum negative for Anti‐HAV IgM and IgG. An interviewer administered questionnaire was used for the data collection and multiple logistic regression was applied to determine the independent risk factors. The results are expressed as adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Risk factors for HAV infection were poor knowledge regarding hepatitis (AOR;3.98, 95% CI = 1.97‐8.05), unhygienic sanitary practices (OR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.42‐5.23), unhygienic practices related to drinking water (OR = 2.67; 95% CI = 1.37‐5.21), residing in urban areas (OR = 5.94; 95% CI = 2.98‐11.86) and lower family income (OR = 2.83; 95% CI = 1.30‐6.13). CONCLUSIONS: The independent modifiable risk factors for HAV infection were poor knowledge regarding hepatitis, unhygienic sanitary practices, and unhygienic practices related to drinking water. Community awareness must be raised on hygienic practices and safe water drinking practices. Inequities of social determinates of health must be addressed."

We enrolled children aged 1‐48 months at baseline and measured outcomes before and 12 and 24 months after the intervention, with concurrent measurement among children in a comparable control arm. Despite nearly exclusive use, we found no evidence that intervention affected the prevalence of any measured outcome after 12 or 24 months of exposure. Among children born into study sites after intervention, we observed a reduced prevalence of Trichuris and Shigella infection relative to the same age group at baseline (<2 years old). Protection from birth may be important to reduce exposure to and infection with enteric pathogens in this setting."

To assess the effectiveness of a novel house design, ""Star home"", and improved toilets in reducing the abundance of domestic flies, potential carriers of diarrhoeal pathogens, a randomized controlled trial was carried out in rural Tanzania. METHODS: Domestic fly populations were monitored in 28 randomly selected Star homes and 28 traditional thatched roofs and mud‐walled houses over 2 years from January 2022 to December 2023. Flies were sampled in kitchens and toilets using baited‐fly traps from 07.00 h to 17.30 h every 7 weeks. To assess the production of flies from toilets, traps were placed over drop holes to collect emerging flies. Duration of external door openings to the kitchens was recorded with data loggers. FINDINGS: Of the 1527 flies collected, 76% were Chrysomya putoria, 16% Musca domestica and 8% Sarcophaga spp. In kitchen collections, there were 46% fewer C. putoria flies [adjusted mean rate ratio (RR) = 0.54] and 69% fewer Sarcophaga spp. (RR = 0.31) in Star homes compared to traditional houses. There was no difference in the abundance of M. domestica in the two study groups. In toilets, there was 49% fewer C. putoria (RR = 0.51), but no difference was observed for other domestic fly species. No flies emerged from Star home toilets compared with a mean of 4.2 flies/trap/day in traditional toilets. During the day, the external doors od Star homes were open for an average of 13.0 min/h less than in traditional houses. CONCLUSIONS: Star homes reduced the abundance of domestic flies, apart from houseflies, in the kitchen and there were fewer C. putoria, a putative vector of diarrhoeal diseases, in Star home toilets compared to traditional houses. Changing the design of buildings can contribute to a decline in domestic flies and may lead to a reduction in diarrhoeal diseases."

EED can contribute to stunting through reduced digestion and absorption of nutrients, increased susceptibility to infections, increased systemic inflammation and inhibition of growth hormones. EED can be apparent by age 12 weeks, highlighting the need for early intervention. Modulating the early life gut microbiota using synbiotics may improve resistance against colonisation of the gut by enteropathogens, reduce EED and improve linear growth. Methods and analysis An individually randomised, two‐arm, open‐label, controlled trial will be conducted in Kaffrine District, Senegal. Infants will be recruited at birth and randomised to either receive a synbiotic containing two Bifidobacterium strains and one Lactobacillus strain, or no intervention, during the first 6 months of life. The impact of the intervention will be evaluated primarily by comparing length‐for‐age z‐score at 12 months of age in infants in the intervention and control arms of the trial. Secondary outcome variables include biomarkers of intestinal inflammation, intestinal integrity and permeability, gut microbiota profiles, presence of enteropathogens, systemic inflammation, growth hormones, epigenetic status and episodes of illness during follow‐up to age 24 months. Discussion This trial will contribute to the evidence base on the use of a synbiotic to improve linear growth by preventing or ameliorating EED in a low‐resource setting.

METHODS: Client‐owned dogs presenting to veterinary clinics from households in France, Hungary and Germany were screened for intestinal nematodes. Dogs with an initial positive faecal egg count that was subsequently confirmed with a follow‐up faecal examination to demonstrate the presence of naturally occurring mixed or mono‐infections with Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Trichuris vulpis or Ancylostoma caninum were enrolled on Day 0 into the study. Households were randomised in an approximately 2:1 ratio to receive either an investigational product (IP; Credelio Plus tablets) or control product (CP; Nexgard Spectra® tablets) as treatment. Dogs were administered the IP (n = 278) or CP (n = 117) once on Day 0 at a dose rate of 0.75‐1.56 mg/kg bodyweight milbemycin oxime and 20.0‐41.5 mg/kg bodyweight lotilaner (IP) or as recommended (CP). Effectiveness of the IP and CP treatments was based on the post‐treatment reduction in geometric mean faecal egg counts on Day 8 (range Day 7‐10) after treatment as compared to their pre‐treatment nematode faecal egg counts. RESULTS: Geometric mean (GM) faecal egg counts for T. canis, A caninum and T. vulpis were reduced by ≥ 97.2% in the Credelio Plus group and  by ≥ 95.3% in the afoxolaner + milbemycin oxime group. There were insufficient data to calculate a percentage reduction in GM faecal egg counts between Day 0 and Day 8 for T. leonina due to low prevalence. Credelio Plus was well tolerated in this field study. Of the 355 total doses administered, 82.3% were accepted free choice in the IP group compared to 80.8% in the CP group. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated effectiveness (≥ 97.2% reduction), safety and tablet acceptance of a combination of milbemycin oxime and lotilaner (Credelio Plus) administered orally to dogs with natural intestinal infections of T. canis, A. caninum and T. vulpis."
"Hand-washing promotion for preventing diarrhoea","Ejemot-Nwadiaro, RI; Ehiri, JE; Arikpo, D; Meremikwu, MM; Critchley, JA","Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)","10.1002/14651858.CD004265.pub4","12","1","2021","BACKGROUND: Diarrhoea accounts for 1.8 million deaths in children in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). One of the identified strategies to prevent diarrhoea is hand washing. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of hand‐washing promotion interventions on diarrhoeal episodes in children and adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP), and metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) on 8 January 2020, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Individually‐randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs that compared the effects of hand‐washing interventions on diarrhoea episodes in children and adults with no intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We stratified the analyses for child day‐care centres or schools, community, and hospital‐based settings. Where appropriate, we pooled incidence rate ratios (IRRs) using the generic inverse variance method and a random‐effects model with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included 29 RCTs: 13 trials from child day‐care centres or schools in mainly high‐income countries (54,471 participants), 15 community‐based trials in LMICs (29,347 participants), and one hospital‐based trial among people with AIDS in a high‐income country (148 participants). All the trials and follow‐up assessments were of short‐term duration. Hand‐washing promotion (education activities, sometimes with provision of soap) at child day‐care facilities or schools prevent around one‐third of diarrhoea episodes in high‐income countries (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.85; 9 trials, 4664 participants, high‐certainty evidence) and may prevent a similar proportion in LMICs, but only two trials from urban Egypt and Kenya have evaluated this (IRR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.99; 2 trials, 45,380 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Only four trials reported measures of behaviour change, and the methods of data collection were susceptible to bias. In one trial from the USA hand‐washing behaviour was reported to improve; and in the trial from Kenya that provided free soap, hand washing did not increase, but soap use did (data not pooled; 3 trials, 1845 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Hand‐washing promotion among communities in LMICs probably prevents around one‐quarter of diarrhoea episodes (IRR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.81; 9 trials, 15,950 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, six of these nine trials were from Asian settings, with only one trial from South America and two trials from sub‐Saharan Africa. In seven trials, soap was provided free alongside hand‐washing education, and the overall average effect size was larger than in the two trials which did not provide soap (soap provided: RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.75; 7 trials, 12,646 participants; education only: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.05; 2 trials, 3304 participants). There was increased hand washing at major prompts (before eating or cooking, after visiting the toilet, or cleaning the baby's bottom) and increased compliance with hand‐hygiene procedure (behavioural outcome) in the intervention groups compared with the control in community trials (data not pooled: 4 trials, 3591 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Hand‐washing promotion for the one trial conducted in a hospital among a high‐risk population showed significant reduction in mean episodes of diarrhoea (1.68 fewer) in the intervention group (mean difference ‐1.68, 95% CI ‐1.93 to ‐1.43; 1 trial, 148 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Hand‐washing frequency increased to seven times a day in the intervention group versus three times a day in the control arm in this hospital trial (1 trial, 148 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We found no trials evaluating the effects of hand‐washing promotions on diarrhoea‐related deaths or cost effectiveness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Hand‐washing promotion probably reduces diarrhoea episodes in both child day‐care centres in high‐income countries and among communities living in LMICs by about 30%. The included trials do not provide evidence about the long‐term impact of the interventions."
"Community burden and transmission of acute gastroenteritis caused by norovirus and rotavirus in the Netherlands (RotaFam): a prospective household-based cohort study","Quee, FA; de Hoog, MLA; Schuurman, R; Bruijning-Verhagen, P","The lancet. Infectious diseases","10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30058-X","20","5","2020","Background: Norovirus and rotavirus are the dominant pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis in children. To quantify their natural disease burden and transmission, we prospectively monitored households in an endemic setting in the Netherlands, a high‐income country that does not have a rotavirus vaccination programme. Methods: We did a prospective, household survey‐based cohort study in the Netherlands. Randomly selected households from the Dutch Population Register were invited to participate if they had at least three household members, including a child younger than 2 years. A member of each household was asked to record the gastrointestinal symptoms of all household members every day for 10 consecutie weeks using an interactive smartphone application. Real‐time detection of acute gastroenteritis onset on the basis of entered symptoms activated requests for the case and one other household member to complete disease questionnaires and provide stool samples. Stool samples were analysed by real‐time PCR for norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus 40/41, and astrovirus. We calculated the per‐pathogen proportion of households with at least one secondary acute gastroenteritis episode (epidemiologically but not microbiologically linked), the probability of a secondary episode in household members at risk (secondary attack rate), and the microbiologically confirmed symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission rates. Findings: During two seasons (January to March) in 2016 and 2017, 30 660 households were invited to participate, of which 604 households including 2298 individuals were enrolled. 697 acute gastroenteritis episodes were detected in 358 households, with samples obtained from 609 (87%) of 697 episodes. Norovirus (150 [25%] of 609 cases) and rotavirus (91 [15%] cases) were most frequently detected. Astrovirus was detected in 50 (8%) samples and adenovirus 40/41 in 24 (4%) samples. Overall disease severity was higher in patients with rotavirus‐positive acute gastroenteritis than those with norovirus‐positive acute gastroenteritis. Norovirus led to higher disease burden in adults than did rotavirus. Following an index case, a secondary acute gastroenteritis episode occurred in 34 (35%) of 96 households for norovirus and 26 (46%) of 56 households for rotavirus. Secondary attack rates were 15% (37 of 244 participants) for norovirus and 28% (33 of 120 participants) for rotavirus and asymptomatic transmission rates were 51% (52 of 102 household members) for norovirus and 22% (12 of 55 household members) for rotavirus. The microbiologically confirmed symptomatic transmission rate for norovirus was 10% (25 of 254 household members) and 18% for rotavirus (21 of 119 household members). Interpretation: In households with young family members in a setting without rotavirus vaccination, norovirus is the dominant acute gastroenteritis pathogen, but rotavirus is associated with more severe disease. There was substantial within‐household transmission, both symptomatic and asymptomatic. The study provides key quantities on transmission, which can inform vaccine policy decisions and act as a baseline for impact evaluations in high‐income settings.

"Treatment heterogeneity of water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition interventions on child growth by environmental enteric dysfunction and pathogen status for young children in Bangladesh","Butzin-Dozier, Z; Ji, Y; Coyle, J; Malenica, I; Rogawski McQuade, ET; Grembi, JA; Platts-Mills, JA; Houpt, ER; Graham, JP; Ali, S; Rahman, MZ; Alauddin, M; Famida, SL; Akther, S; Hossen, MS; Mutsuddi, P; Shoab, AK; Rahman, M; Islam, MO; Miah, R; Taniuchi, M; Liu, J; Alauddin, ST; Stewart, CP; Luby, SP; Colford, JM; Hubbard, AE; Mertens, AN; Lin, A","PLoS neglected tropical diseases","10.1371/journal.pntd.0012881","19","2","2025","BACKGROUND: Water, sanitation, hygiene (WSH), nutrition (N), and combined (N+WSH) interventions are often implemented by global health organizations, but WSH interventions may insufficiently reduce pathogen exposure, and nutrition interventions may be modified by environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), a condition of increased intestinal permeability and inflammation. This study investigated the heterogeneity of these treatments' effects based on individual pathogen and EED biomarker status with respect to child linear growth. METHODS: We applied cross‐validated targeted maximum likelihood estimation and super learner ensemble machine learning to assess the conditional treatment effects in subgroups defined by biomarker and pathogen status. We analyzed treatment (N+WSH, WSH, N, or control) randomly assigned in‐utero, child pathogen and EED data at 14 months of age, and child HAZ at 28 months of age. We estimated the difference in mean child height for age Z‐score (HAZ) under the treatment rule and the difference in stratified treatment effect (treatment effect difference) comparing children with high versus low pathogen/biomarker status while controlling for baseline covariates. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 1,522 children who had a median HAZ of ‐1.56. We found that fecal myeloperoxidase (N+WSH treatment effect difference 0.0007 HAZ, WSH treatment effect difference 0.1032 HAZ, N treatment effect difference 0.0037 HAZ) and Campylobacter infection (N+WSH treatment effect difference 0.0011 HAZ, WSH difference 0.0119 HAZ, N difference 0.0255 HAZ) were associated with greater effect of all interventions on anthropometry. In other words, children with high myeloperoxidase or Campylobacter infection experienced a greater impact of the interventions on anthropometry. We found that a treatment rule that assigned the N+WSH (HAZ difference 0.23, 95% CI (0.05, 0.41)) and WSH (HAZ difference 0.17, 95% CI (0.04, 0.30)) interventions based on EED biomarkers and pathogens increased predicted child growth compared to the randomly allocated intervention. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that EED biomarkers and pathogen status, particularly Campylobacter and myeloperoxidase (a measure of gut inflammation), may be related to the impact of N+WSH, WSH, and N interventions on child linear growth."
"Conversion of unresponsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibition by fecal microbiota transplantation in patients with metastatic melanoma: study protocol for a randomized phase Ib/IIa trial","Borgers, JSW; Burgers, FH; Terveer, EM; van Leerdam, ME; Korse, CM; Kessels, R; Flohil, CC; Blank, CU; Schumacher, TN; van Dijk, M; Henderickx, JGE; Keller, JJ; Verspaget, HW; Kuijper, EJ; Haanen, JBAG","BMC cancer","10.1186/s12885-022-10457-y","22","1","2022","Background: The gut microbiome plays an important role in immune modulation. Specifically, presence or absence of certain gut bacterial taxa has been associated with better antitumor immune responses. Furthermore, in trials using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to treat melanoma patients unresponsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), complete responses (CR), partial responses (PR), and durable stable disease (SD) have been observed. However, the underlying mechanism determining which patients will or will not respond and what the optimal FMT composition is, has not been fully elucidated, and a discrepancy in microbial taxa associated with clinical response has been observed between studies. Furthermore, it is unknown whether a change in the microbiome itself, irrespective of its origin, or FMT from ICI responding donors, is required for reversion of ICI‐unresponsiveness. To address this, we will transfer microbiota of either ICI responder or nonresponder metastatic melanoma patients via FMT. Methods: In this randomized, double‐blinded phase Ib/IIa trial, 24 anti‐PD1‐refractory patients with advanced stage cutaneous melanoma will receive an FMT from either an ICI responding or nonresponding donor, while continuing anti‐PD‐1 treatment. Donors will be selected from patients with metastatic melanoma treated with anti‐PD‐1 therapy. Two patients with a good response (≥ 30% decrease according to RECIST 1.1 within the past 24 months) and two patients with progression (≥ 20% increase according to RECIST 1.1 within the past 3 months) will be selected as ICI responding or nonresponding donors, respectively. The primary endpoint is clinical benefit (SD, PR or CR) at 12 weeks, confirmed on a CT scan at 16 weeks. The secondary endpoint is safety, defined as the occurrence of grade ≥ 3 toxicity. Exploratory endpoints are progression‐free survival and changes in the gut microbiome, metabolome, and immune cells. Discussion: Transplanting fecal microbiota to restore the patients’ perturbed microbiome has proven successful in several indications. However, less is known about the potential role of FMT to improve antitumor immune response. In this trial, we aim to investigate whether administration of FMT can reverse resistance to anti‐PD‐1 treatment in patients with advanced stage melanoma, and whether the ICI‐responsiveness of the feces donor is associated with its effectiveness.

Addition of probiotics as adjuvants for H. pylori antibiotic treatment can increase eradication rate and decrease treatment side effects. Although many studies show the benefits of S. boulardii CNCM I‐745 in the treatment of H. pylori infection, the mechanism by which those benefits are achieved is unknown. Here, we report clinical characteristics and fecal microbiota changes comparing conventional anti‐H. pylori therapy versus conventional therapy supplemented with S. boulardii CNCM I‐745. A total of 74 patients were included in the current study; patients positive for H. pylori (n = 63) were randomly assigned to 2 groups: 34 patients received conventional therapy and 29 antibiotic therapy plus 750 mg of S. boulardii CNCM I‐745 daily, for 2 weeks. Eleven patients negative for H. pylori infection were also studied. Patients provided 3 fecal samples: before initiating the antibiotic treatment, upon its completion, and 1 month after treatment. Patients were contacted every 72 h to inquire about side effects and compliance. DNA was extracted, and 16S rRNA was amplified and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq. Bioinformatic analysis was performed using QIIME2. Patients who received the probiotic had a significantly lower frequency of associated gastrointestinal symptoms (P = 0.028); higher number of bacterial diversity evenness (P = 0.0156); higher abundance of Enterobacteria; and lower abundance of Bacteroides and Clostridia upon treatment completion. Addition of S. boulardii CNCM I‐745 induced a lower frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms that could be related to changes in gut microbiota."

External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to prostate extends OS in men with metastatic hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) limited to less than 4 metastases. We hypothesized that combination radium‐223 + pelvic EBRT could safely deliver maximal radiotherapy doses to primary and metastatic prostate cancer and may improve disease control. Patients and Methods: Thirty patients with de novo bone metastatic mHSPC who had commenced androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and docetaxel were recruited to this single‐arm, open‐label, prospective clinical trial: Neo‐adjuvant Androgen Deprivation Therapy, Pelvic Radiotherapy and RADium‐223 (ADRRAD; for new presentation T1‐4 N0‐1 M1B adenocarcinoma of prostate). Study treatments were: ADT, 6 cycles of radium‐223 q28 days, conventionally fractionated prostate radiotherapy (74 Gy) and simultaneous integrated boost to pelvic lymph nodes (60 Gy). Results: No grade 4/5 toxicity was observed. Three patients experienced grade 3 leukopenia, and 1 each experienced grade 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia; all were asymptomatic. One patient each experienced grade 3 dysuria and grade 3 urinary infection. No grade 3 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was observed. On treatment completion, there was a signal of efficacy; 24 (80%) patients had whole‐body MRI evidence of tumor response or stability. Twenty‐seven (90%) patients showed a reduction in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) compared with pretreatment levels. Median progression‐free survival was 20.5 months. Conclusions: This is the first trial of combination ADT, radium‐223, and EBRT to pelvis, post docetaxel. The combination was safe, with an efficacy signal. Multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCT) are warranted."

We assessed the impact of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and infant and young child feeding (IYCF) interventions on enteric infections in the Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trial in rural Zimbabwe. Methods. We tested stool samples collected at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of age and during diarrhea using quantitative molecular diagnostics for 29 pathogens. We estimated the effects of the WASH, IYCF, and combined WASH + IYCF interventions on individual enteropathogen prevalence and quantity, total numbers of pathogens detected, and incidence of pathogen‐attributable diarrhea. Results. WASH interventions decreased the number of parasites detected (difference in number compared to non‐WASH arms, ‐0.07 [95% confidence interval, ‐.14 to ‐.02]), but had no statistically significant effects on bacteria, viruses, or the prevalence and quantity of individual enteropathogens after accounting for multiple comparisons. IYCF interventions had no significant effects on individual or total enteropathogens. Neither intervention had significant effects on pathogen‐attributable diarrhea. Conclusions. The WASH interventions implemented in SHINE (improved pit latrine, hand‐washing stations, liquid soap, pointof‐ use water chlorination, and clean play space) did not prevent enteric infections. Transformative WASH interventions are needed that are more efficacious in interrupting fecal‐oral microbial transmission in children living in highly contaminated environments."

Faecal microbiota transplantation restores gut microbiota and may lead to faster resolution of diarrhoea. METHODS: Into this prospective, multi‐centre, randomized controlled trial we will enrol 36 critically ill patients with antibiotic‐associated diarrhoea. We will exclude patients with ongoing sepsis, need of systemic antibiotics, or those after recent bowel surgery or any other reason that prevents the FMT. Randomisation will be in 1:1 ratio. Patients in the control group will receive standard treatment based on oral diosmectite. In the intervention group, patients will receive, in addition to the standard of care, faecal microbiota transplantation via rectal tube, in the form of a preparation mixed from 7 thawed aliquots (50 mL) made from fresh stool of 7 healthy unrelated donors and quarantined deep frozen for 3 to 12 months. Primary outcome is treatment failure defined as intervention not delivered or diarrhoea persisting at day 7 after randomisation. Secondary outcomes include safety measures such as systemic inflammatory response, adverse events, and also diarrhoea recurrence within 28 days. Exploratory outcomes focus on gut barrier function and composition of intestinal microbiota. DISCUSSION: Faecal microbiota transplantation has been effective for dysbiosis in non‐critically ill patients with recurrent C. difficile infections and it is plausible to hypothesize that it will be equally effective for symptoms of dysbiosis in the critically ill patients. In addition, animal experiments and observational data suggest other benefits such as reduced colonization with multi‐drug resistant bacteria and improved gut barrier and immune function. The frozen faeces from unrelated donors are immediately available when needed, unlike those from the relatives, who require lengthy investigation. Using multiple donors maximises graft microbiota diversity. Nonetheless, in vulnerable critically ill patients, Faecal microbiota transplantation might lead to bacterial translocation and unforeseen complications. From growing number of case series it is clear that its off label use in the critically ill patients is increasing and that there is a burning need to objectively assess its efficacy and safety, which this trial aims.

"Environmental factors associated with diarrhoea prevalence among under-five children in the Mataniko settlements in Honiara, Solomon Islands","Gali, A; Krishna, K; Lowry, J; Mohammadnezhad, M","Rural and remote health","10.22605/RRH5308","20","1","2020","INTRODUCTION: Children aged less than 5 years are often at high risk of diarrhoeal infection. In the Solomon Islands, diarrhoea is the second leading cause of under‐five mortality with about one in every 10 children dying from it before reaching 5 years. This study aims to assess environmental factors that are associated with under‐five diarrhoea prevalence in the Mataniko informal settlements, in Honiara, Solomon Islands. METHODS: Three out of the six settlements along the Mataniko River corridor were randomly selected. Caregivers who were taking care of at least one child under 5 years, and had signed a voluntary informed consent form, were included in the study. Instruments employed to collect the study variables were global positioning system technology and a questionnaire. Each child's medical record was used to verify the date of his or her diarrhoeal status. The data were entered and analysed using SPSS (v23). Binary logistic regression was used to measure the strength of association between under‐five diarrhoea and the independent variables. A p‐value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant (p<0.05). RESULTS: A total of 205 caregivers with at least one child under 5 years participated in the study. Approximately half (45.9%) of the participants reported that their children (<5 years) had suffered with at least one episode of diarrhoea within the 2 weeks prior to the survey. Of the participants, 73.2% did not own a toilet facility and 61.0% of households were built on low‐altitude areas (≤19 m above sea level), and above half (70.6%) were built near (≤125 m) the river. The presence of stagnant wastewater, flies, solid waste and water‐filled containers near households, plus the distance of under‐five households from the river, were found to be directly associated with under‐five diarrhoea in the Mataniko informal settlements (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Awareness and advocacy programs on environmental hygiene, food hygiene and potential health risks about the river should be ongoing at the community level."

Methods: This study compared stool microbiota and short‐chain fatty acids (SCFAs) of 37 term infants with CGISCs with 36 term healthy infants (HIs). Two stool samples were collected from each infant: as soon as possible after birth (week 1) and 10–14 days of life (week 2). Results: Bacterial richness and alpha diversity were comparable between CGISCs and HIs at week 1 and week 2 (all p > 0.05). Beta diversity analysis revealed that at week 1, CGISCs had similar community structures to HIs (p = 0.415). However, by week 2, community structures of CGISCs were significantly different from HIs (p = 0.003). At week 1, there were no significant differences in the relative abundances of genera Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides between CGISCs and HIs. At week 2, the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium was significantly lower in CGISCs (mean percentage 7.21 ± 13.49 vs. 28.96 ± 19.6; p = 0.002). Bacteroides were also less abundant in the CGISC group (mean percentage 0.12 ± 0.49 vs. 6.59 ± 8.62; p = 0.039). Relative abundance of genera Pseudomonas and Escherichia–Shigella were higher in CGISCs. At week 2, stool concentrations of all SCFAs were lower in CGISCs (all p < 0.001). Conclusions: During hospitalization, neonates with CGISCs develop gut dysbiosis and deficiency of SCFAs. Impact: During hospitalisation, neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical conditions develop gut dysbiosis with deficiency of Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides and increased abundance of Escherichia‐Shigella and Pseudomonas. They also have low levels of short chain fatty acids in their stools compared to healthy infants.This is the first study evaluating the gut microbiota using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing methods and stool short chain fatty acids in neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical conditions and comparing them to healthy infants.The findings of this study will pave the way for randomised trials of bifidobacterial supplementation in neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical conditions."

Globally, approximately 1.5 billion people are infected with Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura or hookworm. Endemic countries carry out periodic mass treatment of at‐risk populations with albendazole or mebendazole as a control measure. Most prevalence studies have focused on school aged children and therefore control programs are implemented at school level, not at community level. In this study, the prevalence of intestinal helminths, including Strongyloides stercoralis, was examined using a comprehensive laboratory approach in a community in northwestern Ethiopia. Methods A cross‐sectional survey was conducted on 792 individuals ≥5 years old in randomly selected houses in a rural district. Stools were examined using three techniques: a formolether concentration, the Baermann technique and a real time polymerase chain reaction test (these last two specific for S. stercoralis). Statistical analyses were performed between two large age groups, children (≤14 years old) and adults (≥15 years old). Results The prevalence of helminths was 91.3%; (95% CI: 89.3–93.3%). Hookworm was the most prevalent, 78.7% (95% CI 75.6–81.4%), followed by S. stercoralis 55.7% (95% CI 52.2– 59.1%). Co‐infection with both was detected in 45.4% (95% CI 42.0–49.0%) of the participants. The mean age of hookworm‐infected individuals was significantly higher than non‐infected ones (p = 0.003). Also, S. stercoralis infection was significantly associated with age, being more prevalent in adults (p = 0.002). Conclusions This is the highest prevalence of S. stercoralis detected in Ethiopia so far. Our results high‐light the need of searching specifically for infection by this parasite since it usually goes unnoticed if helminth studies rely only on conventional diagnostic techniques, i.e. Kato‐Katz.Moreover, the focus of these programs on children undermines the actual prevalence of hookworm. The adult population acts as a reservoir for both hookworm and S. stercoralis and this fact may negatively impact the current control programs in Ethiopia which only target treatment of school aged children. This reservoir, together with a lack of adequate water, sanitation and hygiene, increases the probability of re‐infection in children. Finally, the high prevalence of S. stercoralis found calls for a comprehensive diagnostic approach in endemicareas in addition to a revision of control measures that is, adding ivermectin to current alben‐dazole/mebendazole, since it is the drug of choice for S. stercoralis."
"PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF TWO ANTISEPTIC SOLUTIONS FOR PREVENTION OF CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETER COLONIZATION AND INFECTION IN END STAGE RENAL DISEASE PATIENTS","Giddaluru, GR; Sreedhara, CG; Kishan, A","Indian journal of nephrology","10.4103/0971-4065.391076","33",NA,"2023","BACKGROUND: CVCs are essential components in the care of many patients including those who are chronically or critically ill and those requiring hemodialysis.1 According to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) a CVC or central line (CL) is oean intravascular catheter that terminates at or close to the heart or in one of the great vessels which is used for infusion withdrawal of blood or hemodynamic monitoring. (2) In the United States more than 150 million CVCs are sold each year (3) and they can be classified into short‐term (ST) versus long‐term (LT) catheters depending upon the anticipated duration of catheterization. Although mostly encountered in intensive care units (ICUs) CVCs are increasingly used in non‐ICU wards (4) and outpatient settings. Owing to the invasive procedure necessary for placing a CVC and the break in the integument complications such as exit‐site infections and bloodstream infections (BSIs) can develop. Pathogens either migrate along the outer surface of the catheter into deeper tissue and the bloodstream or less commonly they are introduced into the catheter hub and proceed along the lumen. CVC associated BSIs or central line‐associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are among the most frequent health care associated infections. The infection risk varies with a number of factors including type of device (5) the insertion site (6) and the adherence to preventive measures (7). Incidence rates of catheter infections are usually presented as number of infections per 1000 catheter days. The manual collection of data for this denominator is relatively time‐consuming; therefore electronic algorithms have been studied with the goal of facilitating surveillance (8). Reported rates range from <1 BSI/1000 catheter 'days (9) to 10 or more (10). The microbial spectrum includes a variety of Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacteria as well as yeasts with the predominant organisms being Staphylococcus aureus coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS) and Candida species (spp.). In India two factors contribute to the possibility of higher infection rates in intravenous catheters. Firstly air pollution and secondly the lack of adequate sanitation. Air pollution is a major and growing risk factor for ill health in general in India contributing significantly to the country burden of disease. As per the Global Burden of Disease comparative risk assessment for 2015 air pollution exposure contributes to approximately 1.8 million pr. AIMS OF THE STUDY: 1. To describe SQ53 a novel patented biocidal antimicrobial solution with focus on bacterial attachment and biofilm formation). 2. To compare the efficacy SQ53 is an antimicrobial sporicidal aqueous formulation that is based on a platform of quaternary ammonium chloride compounds (quats).(Other active components include polymeric biguanide chlorocresol bronopol and ethanol) with 10% povidone iodine on the prevention of central venous or arterial catheter colonization and infection. METHODS: From October 2020 to October 2021 220 patients requiring CVC were recruied and divided into 2 groups. 1st Group recied SQ53 solution as antiseptic. 2nd group recieved 10% povidine idoine. What is SQ53? A novel patented biocidal antimicrobial solution that can be made in different forms e.g. as a concentrate or impregnated into wipes. It has been tested against a wide range of bacteria viruses spores and fungal pathogens. Extensive laboratory testing has demonstrated the effectiveness of SQ53 impregnated wipes in cleaning surfaces including catheters over a 24 hour plus time period. In addition it includes no development of VNBC populations or evidence of resistance to the active compounds. SQ53 contains Benzalkonium chloride solution (ADBAC) Didecyl dimethylammoniumchloride (DDAC Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) Bronopol p‐Chloro‐m‐creosol Ethanol (denatured) Monoethylene glycol (MEG) Propan‐2‐ol Methanol Ethanol Aqua SQ53 is available is a sterilised pack with a single wipe inside. The pack is easy to open by tearing off the top end and presenting the contents to the operator to remove under sterile conditions. Definition of compassionate grounds: Patients were deemed suitable to be included in the study on compassionate grounds if they needed long term CVC and had had 2‐line infections or more in the span of 60 days that required hospital admission and change of the line. Such patients were included on a named patient basis and appropriate consent was obtained from them for the use of the SQ53 impregnated wipes as an adjunct for line care. Definition of high‐risk for line infection: These patients were at higher risk for line infections because of the following; a. Older age group (more than 70 years old) b. Prior Episodes pf CRBSI Technique of using SQ53 and 10% povidone iodine in Group 1 and Group 2 SQ53 and 10% povidone iodine was used in the respective groups at two time lines: a. As an adjunct to cleaning the site of puncture during the insertion of a CVC as well as b. Cleaning of the site the catheter and hubs every third day. The site of insertion was prepped under sterile conditions and solution used in the CVC package. After isolation of the site a second wipe down with SQ53 was done at the proposed point of puncture. A radius of 10 cm. from the site of puncture was wiped down with the sterile SQ53 wipe. CONCLUSION: Sq53 solution was more effective than 10% povidone iodine for insertion site care of short‐term central venous and arterial catheters. This effect appeared related to a more efficacious prevention of infections with Gram‐positive bacteria. The use of SQ53, a novel, patented biocide antimicrobial solution as an adjunct to standard insertion and cleaning regimens for intermediate and long‐term catheters in India, significantly dropped the CLABSIs per 365 catheter days from a mean of 48 to 3, making the use of external lines a real possibility in the healthcare sector in the country. CLABSIs are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. The 2 predominating sources of infection are believed to be extraluminal (from the skin during and following insertion) and intraluminal (from contaminated infusates or contaminated catheter hubs). (13) Recommendations regarding the use of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) for skin preparation prior to insertion and in dressings/ sponges placed at the insertion site or as part of the dressing have largely successfully addressed the extraluminal source.

Aim: We performed a randomised trial to assess the efficacy of FMT in patients with IBS. Methods: We randomised 56 patients with diarrhoea‐predominant IBS 1:1 to FMT or placebo via the duodenal route at baseline and week 4. The primary outcome was > 50 points decrease in IBS severity scoring system (IBS‐SSS) score at week 12. Secondary outcomes were improvement in bloating and change in gut microbiota at week 12. After 12‐week follow‐up, those in the placebo group were assigned to receive open‐label FMT. Results: At week 12, 57.1% in the FMT group and 46.4% in the placebo group achieved the primary endpoint (p = 0.42). More patients receiving FMT than placebo had improvement in bloating (72% vs 30%; p = 0.005). In an open‐label extension, 65.2% and 82.4% of patients achieved, respectively, the primary endpoint and improvement in bloating. Faecal microbiome of patients in the FMT group showed a reduction in bacteria like Ruminococcus gnavus and enrichment of bacteria such as Lawsonibacter at week 12, while no change in the placebo group. Functional analyses showed that the hydrogen sulphide‐producing pathway decreased in patients who had FMT (p < 0.05) accompanied by a reduction in contributing bacteria. There were no serious adverse events related to FMT. Conclusion: FMT performed twice at an interval of four weeks did not significantly reduce IBS‐SSS score. However, more patients had improvement in abdominal bloating, which was associated with a reduction in hydrogen sulphide‐producing bacteria. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03125564)."
"Clinical significance of deblocking of nasal breathing in infants and children of early age with acute respiratory viral infections: advantages of isotonic seawater solution","Koloskova, OK; Tarnavska, SI","Modern pediatrics. Ukraine","10.15574/SP.2024.137.84","1","137","2024","Acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) are an urgent problem in young children, which is due to their significant prevalence, they have a constant tendency to increase and occupy the first places in the structure of infectious diseases. Damage to the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract in children with ARVI lead to numerous problems that require adequate replacement of the main functions of the child’s body, which determined the relevance of our study. Purpose — to analyze the effectiveness of the use of isotonic dilution of sea water (Pshyk Mini medicine) for irrigation therapy in nasal congestion in infants and young children caused by acute respiratory infections. Materials and methods. A comprehensive examination of 100 infants and young children with influenza and other ARVI was conducted in the infectious diseases department of the Chernivtsi Regional Children’s Clinical Hospital. The children were randomly divided into 2 clinical groups: the Group I included 55 children (average age — 1.09±0.3 years, the proportion of boys — 58.1%), who, as part of complex standard therapy, received nasal irrigation using 2–3 drops of Pshyk mini medicine in each nostril 3 times/day. The Group II included 45 patients (average age — 1.15±0.2 years (p>0.05), the proportion of boys — 59.1% (p>0.05)), in whom isotonic sodium chloride solution was used for the purpose of the nasal sanitation. Results. The conducted studies showed that starting from the 3–4th day of hospitalization, a statistically significant decrease in catarrhal manifestations and the severity of nasal obstruction was noted in patients of the Group I who received Pshyk Mini in complex treatment. In particular, in relation to the results of the Group II, in the children of the Group I, on the 4th day of inpatient treatment, the chances of reducing the severity of catarrhal manifestations (estimated ≤2 points) increased: the absolute risk increase — 53.0%, the relative risk increase — 67.9% (95% CI: 57.8–76.9) with the minimum number of patients who need to be treated to obtain a positive result — 1.5. We also established that compared to the representatives of the Group II, children of the Group I had almost a 4‐fold increase in the chances of restoring tolerance to feeding (estimation of feeding difficulties ≤2 points): attributive risk — 30.5%, relative risk — 1.6 (95% CI: 0.6–4.8), odds ratio — 3.9 (95% CI: 1.2–12.3). Conclusions. For the purpose of unblocking of nasal breathing in infants and children of early age at the background of acute respiratory viral infections, the use of an isotonic solution of sea water (Pshyk Mini medicine) has a number of significant advantages compared to the use of an isotonic solution of sodium chloride for this purpose. The research was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. The study protocol was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of the participating institution. The informed consent of the patient was obtained for conducting the studies."
"Better Existing Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Can Reduce the Risk of Cholera in an Endemic Setting: results From a Prospective Cohort Study From Kolkata, India","Islam, MT; Im, J; Ahmmed, F; Kim, DR; Tadesse, BT; Kang, S; Khanam, F; Chowdhury, F; Ahmed, T; Firoj, MG; Aziz, AB; Hoque, M; Park, J; Jeon, HJ; Kanungo, S; Dutta, S; Zaman, K; Khan, AI; Marks, F; Kim, JH; Qadri, F; Clemens, JD","Open forum infectious diseases","10.1093/ofid/ofad535","10","11","2023","Background. Global cholera control efforts rely heavily on effective water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions in cholera‐endemic settings. Methods. Using data from a large, randomized controlled trial of oral cholera vaccine conducted in Kolkata, India, we evaluated whether natural variations in WASH in an urban slum setting were predictive of cholera risk. From the control population (n = 55 086), baseline WASH data from a randomly selected “training subpopulation” (n = 27 634) were analyzed with recursive partitioning to develop a dichotomous (“better” vs “not better”) composite household WASH variable from several WASH features collected at baseline, and this composite variable was then evaluated in a mutually exclusive “validation population” (n = 27 452). We then evaluated whether residents of better WASH households in the entire population (n = 55 086) experienced lower cholera risk using Cox regression models. Better WASH was defined by a combination of 4 dichotomized WASH characteristics including safe source of water for daily use, safe source of drinking water, private or shared flush toilet use, and always handwashing with soap after defecation. Results. Residence in better WASH households was associated with a 30% reduction in risk of cholera over a 5‐year period (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.70 [95% confidence interval, .49–.99]; P = .048). We also found that the impact of better WASH households on reducing cholera risk was greatest in young children (0–4 years) and this effect progressively declined with age. Conclusions. The evidence suggests that modest improvements in WASH facilities and behaviors significantly modify cholera risk and may be an important component of cholera prevention and elimination strategies in endemic settings.

"Human polyomaviruses 10 and 11 in faecal samples from Brazilian children","Pinheiro, MS; Mendes, GS; Santos, N","Brazilian journal of microbiology","10.1007/s42770-019-00166-3","51","2","2020","The human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) 10 and 11 have been detected in faecal material and are tentatively associated with diarrhoeal disease. However, to date, there are insufficient data to confirm or rule out this association, or even to provide basic information about these viruses, such as how they are distributed in the population, the persistence sites and their pathogenesis. In this study, we analysed stool specimens from Brazilian children with and without acute diarrhoea to investigate the excretion of HPyV10 and HPyV11 as well as their possible associations with diarrhoea. A total of 460 stool specimens were obtained from children with acute diarrhoea of unknown aetiology, and 106 stool specimens were obtained from healthy asymptomatic children under 10 years old. Samples were collected during the periods of 1999‐2006, 2010‐2012 and 2016‐2017, and found previously to be negative for other enteric viruses and bacteria. The specimens were screened for HPyV10 and HPyV11 DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Randomly selected positive samples were sequenced to confirm the presence of HPyV10 and HPyV11. The sequenced strains showed a percent of nucleotide identity of 93.4‐99.6% and 85.5‐98.9% with the reference HPyV10 and HPyV11 strains, respectively, confirming the PCR results. HPyV10 and HPyV11 were detected in 7.2% and 4.7% of the stool specimens from children with and without diarrhoea, respectively. The prevalence of both viruses was the same among children with diarrhoea and healthy children. There was also no difference between boys and girls or the degree of disease (severe, moderate or mild) among groups. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all of the genotypes described so far for HPyV10 and HPyV11 circulate in Rio de Janeiro. Our results do not support an association between HPyV10 and HPyV11 in stool samples and paediatric gastroenteritis. Nevertheless, the excretion of HPyV10 and HPyV11 in faeces indicates that faecal‐oral transmission is possible."

A clear understanding of the seroepidemiology and correlates of protection for invasive NTS (iNTS) in relation to key risk factors (malaria, anaemia, malnutrition) in children in Africa is needed to inform strategies for disease control including vaccine implementation. METHODOLOGY: The SAiNTS study is a prospective community cohort study with paired serology samples from 2500 Malawian children 0‐5 years at baseline and three months to measure age‐stratified acquisition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O‐antigen antibody (IgG) and serum bactericidal activity to the main serovars causing iNTS ( Salmonella Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis). Children are selected from mapped and censused randomly selected households in Chikwawa, Malawi; an area with substantial malaria burden. The sampling framework is set within a malaria vaccination (RTS,S/ AS01) phase 4 cluster randomized trial, known as the Epidemiology Study of Malaria Transmission Intensity (EPI‐MAL), allowing exploration of the impact of malaria vaccination on acquisition of immunity to NTS. Risk factor data for invasive disease will be collected using rapid diagnostic tests for malaria and anaemia, anthropometry for malnutrition, and a validated questionnaire for indicators of socioeconomic status, water and sanitation. All data will be recorded through electronic case report forms using the REDCap and the Open Data Kit (ODK) platforms. Stool sample analysis includes NTS culture and pan‐Salmonella polymerase chain reaction to assess enteric exposure and biomarkers of environmental enteric dysfunction. Cases with iNTS disease will be followed up for comparison with community controls. CONCLUSIONS: The final cohort of 2500 children will allow investigation into the impact of risk factors for iNTS on the acquisition of immunity in children 0‐5 years in an endemic setting, including comparisons to partner seroepidemiology studies in three other sub‐Saharan African sites (1000 children per site). The data generated will be key to informing iNTS disease control measures including targeted risk factor interventions and vaccine implementation through investigation of correlates of protection and identifying windows of immune susceptibility in at‐risk populations."

The gut microbiome displays diurnal rhythms, which may be influenced by meal timing. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effect of the timing of main meal consumption on the microbiome and cardiometabolic biomarkers of the host. Methods: Seventeen healthy adults randomly consumed an isocaloric diet for 7 days, twice, by alternating lunch with dinner meals, and with a 2‐week washout in‐between. Sixty percent of the participants' daily energy requirements was consumed either as lunch or dinner, respectively. Meals were provided free to the participants. All fecal samples produced the last 3 days of each intervention were collected and analyzed for microbial profiling (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing), quantitative estimation of representative bacterial groups (qPCR) of the gut microbiome, and the output of short‐chain fatty acids (SCFA) in feces. Fasted blood samples were analyzed for low‐grade inflammatory biomarkers, blood lipids, insulin, and glucose levels. Cumulative energy loss in feces was measured over the collection period using bomb calorimetry. Results: Meal timing had no significant effects on fecal SCFA output, energy loss in feces, microbial community profiling, and bacterial species relative abundance. The absolute concentration of Escherichia coli was significantly higher after the large lunch intervention (p = 0.02). No effects on blood biomarkers of cardiometabolic health were observed. Conclusions: In a well‐controlled study, main meal timing displayed minimal acute effects on the gut microbiome composition, its diet‐related function, and blood biomarkers of cardiometabolic health."
"Sanitation practices during early phases of COVID-19 lockdown in peri-urban communities in Tamil Nadu, India","Ashraf, S; Kuang, J; Das, U; Bicchieri, C","American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","10.4269/ajtmh.20-0830","103","5","2020","In countries without adequate access to improved sanitation, government‐imposed restrictions during the COVID‐19 pandemic can impact toilet usage. In India, where millions have recently transitioned to using a toilet, pandemic‐related barriers to use might increase open defecation practices. We assessed changes in reported defecation practices in peri‐urban communities in Tamil Nadu. Field assistants conducted phone surveys in 26 communities in two districts from May 20, 2020 to May 25, 2020. They asked respondents about their access to a toilet, whether they or a family member left their house to defecate in the past week, and whether specific practices had changed since the lockdown. Among 2,044 respondents, 60% had access to a private toilet, 11% to a public or community toilet, whereas 29% lacked access to any toilet facility. In our study, 92% of the respondents did not change their defecation behaviors in the 2 months following the pandemic‐related lockdown. About a third (27%) reported that they or a family member left their house daily to defecate amid lockdown measures. A majority of those with private toilets (91%) or with public toilets (69%) continued using them. Respondents with private toilet access were more likely to report an increased frequency of handwashing with soap (prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.04‐3.05) since the lockdown. The lack of private toilets contributes to the need to leave the house amid a lockdown. Maintaining shared toilets require disinfection protocols and behavioral precautions to limit the risk of fomite transmission. Robust urban COVID‐19 control strategies should include enhanced sanitation facility management and safe usage messaging."
"Sequential Versus Continuous Feeding and Its Effect on the Gut Microbiota in Critically Ill Patients: a Randomized Controlled Trial","Yao, B; Liu, JY; Liu, Y; Song, XX; Wang, SB; Liu, N; Dong, ZH; Yuan, ZY; Han, XN; Xing, JY","Clinical nutrition ESPEN","10.1016/j.clnesp.2025.01.019","66",NA,"2025","BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota disturbance may worsen critical illnesses and is responsible for the progression of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In our previous study, there was a trend towards a higher α‐diversity of the gut microbiota in sequential feeding (SF) than in continuous feeding (CF) for critically ill patients. We designed this non‐blinded, randomized controlled study to confirm these results. METHODS: All the enrolled patients received continuous feeding in the beginning. After achieving ≥80 % of the nutrition target calories (25‐30 kcal/kg/d), the patients were randomized into the SF group or the CF group. In the SF group, continuous feeding was changed into intermittent feeding. The total daily dosage of enteral nutrition was equally distributed during three periods at 7‐9:00, 11‐13:00 and 17‐19:00. After 7 days of randomization, fresh stool and serum were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis respectively. Meanwhile, routine blood test indicators and metabolic indicators were recorded. RESULTS: Finally, data from 65 patients in the SF group and 69 patients in the CF group were used for intention‐to‐treat analysis. There was no difference in the Shannon index between the SF group and CF group [2.5 (1.7‐3.4) vs. 2.6 (1.5‐3.5), P = 0.934]. However, at the genus level, the abundances of Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG‐003 and Howardella increased in the SF group. Some metabolic indicators (the albumin level, total cholesterol level and total bile acid level) and the increases in lymphocyte counts in the SF group were different from those in the CF group (P < 0.05). In untargeted metabolomic analysis, 58 differentially abundant metabolites between the two groups were found. The pathway with the highest enrichment factors was primary bile acid biosynthesis according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Database classification. Regarding adverse events, the gut tolerance, average glucose and incidence of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia were similar between the SF group and CF group. The mortality rate in the SF group was lower than that in the CF group, but there was no statistical difference (9.2 % vs. 13.0 %, P = 0.484). CONCLUSION: SF did not increase the diversity of gut microbiota in critically ill patients. However, it did alter the abundances of some gut microbes and affect some metabolites. Its clinical significance requires further exploration. In addition, the gut tolerance and safety of SF were similar to that of CF. TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.

One of the recommended trainings for improving environmental hygiene for low‐resourced facilities, the TEACH CLEAN package, uses a training of trainers model. A selected cadre “champions” which in turn train their peers with responsibilities on environmental hygiene at the facility level. Early pilot data to test its effectiveness of this training package are very promising. Objectives: The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of an environmental cleaning bundle to improve microbiological cleanliness in Cambodian hospitals‐the CLEAN FRONTLINE study. Methods: TEACH CLEAN was implemented across all hospitals (13) of three provinces in Cambodia. A stepped wedge randomised trial was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the training package to improve microbiological cleanliness in Cambodian hospitals. All facilities received the intervention at four distinct time points‐the timing was randomised. The design included eleven months of data collection. The main outcome is microbiological cleanliness (< 2.5 cfu/ cm2 = clean; ≥ 2.5 cfu/cm2 = not clean) measured using a non‐specific agar on one side for measuring total Aerobic Colony Counts (ACC/ cm2). Along the main impact evaluation, we also conducted a process evaluation based on qualitative interviews and structured questionnaire responses. Results: The cleanliness level during the non‐intervention period was overall 47.4%. We are currently undertaking the main analysis of the trial data and the process evaluation data that we aim to share during the conference. Conclusion: This is the first randomised trial of environmental cleaning in a low‐resource setting. Evidence from this trial contributes to future policy and practice guidelines about hospital environmental hygiene and ultimately could reduce healthcare‐associated infections."

Gastrointestinal and liver physiology","10.1152/ajpgi.00046.2020","319","2","2020","Antibiotic treatment is a standard therapy for Clostridioides difficile infection, but dysbiosis of the gut microbiota due to antibiotic exposure is also a major risk factor for the disease. Following an initial episode of C. difficile infection, a relentless cycle of recurrence can occur, where persistent treatment‐related dysbiosis predisposes the patient to subsequent relapse. This study uses a longitudinal study design to compare the effects of a narrow‐spectrum (ridinilazole) or broad‐spectrum antibiotic (vancomycin) on intestinal bile acid profiles and their associations with gut bacteria over the course of C. difficile infection treatment. At the end of treatment (day 10), subjects receiving vancomycin showed a nearly 100‐fold increase in the ratio of conjugated to secondary bile acids in their stool compared with baseline, whereas subjects receiving ridinilazole maintained this ratio near baseline levels. Correlation analysis detected significant positive associations between secondary bile acids and several Bacteroidales and Clostridiales families. These families were depleted in the vancomycin group but preserved at near‐baseline abundance in the ridinilazole group. Enterobacteriaceae, which expanded to a greater extent in the vancomycin group, correlated negatively and positively with secondary and conjugated primary bile acids, respectively. Bile acid ratios at the end of treatment were significantly different between those who recurred and those who did not. These results indicate that a narrow‐spectrum antibiotic maintains an intestinal bile acid profile associated with a lowered risk of recurrence.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to demonstrate in humans the relationships between Clostridioides difficile antibiotic treatment choice and bile acid metabolism both during therapy and after treatment cessation. The results show a microbiota‐ and metabolome‐preserving property of a novel narrow‐spectrum agent that correlates with the agent's favorable sustained clinical response rates compared with broad‐spectrum antibiotic treatment."

We performed a randomized, controlled trial to investigate the effects of a low FODMAP diet on persistent gut symptoms, the intestinal microbiome, and circulating markers of inflammation in patients with quiescent IBD. METHODS: We performed a single‐blind trial of 52 patients with quiescent Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and persistent gut symptoms at 2 large gastroenterology clinics in the United Kingdom. Patients were randomly assigned to groups that followed a diet low in FODMAPs (n = 27) or a control diet (n = 25), with dietary advice, for 4 weeks. Gut symptoms and health‐related quality of life were measured using validated questionnaires. Stool and blood samples were collected at baseline and end of trial. We assessed fecal microbiome composition and function using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and phenotypes of T cells in blood using flow cytometry. RESULTS: A higher proportion of patients reported adequate relief of gut symptoms following the low FODMAP diet (14/27, 52%) than the control diet (4/25, 16%, P=.007). Patients had a greater reduction in irritable bowel syndrome severity scores following the low FODMAP diet (mean reduction of 67; standard error, 78) than the control diet (mean reduction of 34; standard error, 50), although this difference was not statistically significant (P = .075). Following the low FODMAP diet, patients had higher health‐related quality of life scores (81.9 ± 1.2) than patients on the control diet (78.3 ± 1.2, P = .042). A targeted analysis revealed that in stool samples collected at the end of the study period, patients on the low FODMAP diet had significantly lower abundance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii than patients on control diet. However, microbiome diversity and markers of inflammation did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In a trial of the low FODMAP diet vs a control diet in patients with quiescent IBD, we found no significant difference after 4 weeks in change in irritable bowel syndrome severity scores, but significant improvements in specific symptom scores and numbers reporting adequate symptom relief. The low FODMAP diet reduced fecal abundance of microbes believed to regulate the immune response, compared with the control diet, but had no significant effect on markers of inflammation. We conclude that a 4‐week diet low in FODMAPs is safe and effective for managing persistent gut symptoms in patients with quiescent IBD. www.isrctn.com no.: ISRCTN17061468."

This study investigated the heterogeneity of these treatments’ effects based on individual pathogen and EED biomarker status with respect to child linear growth. Methods: We applied cross‐validated targeted maximum likelihood estimation and super learner ensemble machine learning to assess the conditional treatment effects in subgroups defined by biomarker and pathogen status. We analyzed treatment (N+WSH, WSH, N, or control) randomly assigned in‐utero, child pathogen and EED data at 14 months of age, and child LAZ at 28 months of age. We estimated the difference in mean child length for age Z‐score (LAZ) under the treatment rule and the difference in stratified treatment effect (treatment effect difference) comparing children with high versus low pathogen/biomarker status while controlling for baseline covariates. Results: We analyzed data from 1,522 children, who had median LAZ of ‐1.56. We found that myeloperoxidase (N+WSH treatment effect difference 0.0007 LAZ, WSH treatment effect difference 0.1032 LAZ, N treatment effect difference 0.0037 LAZ) and Campylobacter infection (N+WSH treatment effect difference 0.0011 LAZ, WSH difference 0.0119 LAZ, N difference 0.0255 LAZ) were associated with greater effect of all interventions on growth. In other words, children with high myeloperoxidase or Campylobacter infection experienced a greater impact of the interventions on growth. We found that a treatment rule that assigned the N+WSH (LAZ difference 0.23, 95% CI (0.05, 0.41)) and WSH (LAZ difference 0.17, 95% CI (0.04, 0.30)) interventions based on EED biomarkers and pathogens increased predicted child growth compared to the randomly allocated intervention. Conclusions: These findings indicate that EED biomarker and pathogen status, particularly Campylobacter and myeloperoxidase (a measure of gut inflammation), may be related to impact of N+WSH, WSH, and N interventions on child linear growth."

Research indicates that the gut microbiota significantly influences KOA, potentially affecting inflammation and disease progression through the gut‐joint axis. Traditional treatments like non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs offer symptom relief but have adverse effects. Emerging therapies like electroacupuncture (EA) and Tuina (TN) have shown promise in alleviating pain and improving joint function by targeting the gut microbiota. AIM To clarify the efficacy of EA with TN in treating KOA and its effect on gut microbiota regulation. METHODS Sixty patients with KOA were allocated to EA or EA + TN (ET) group (n = 30 each). Seven acupoints were punctured. The ET group received TN after each EA session. Both groups completed 12 sessions. The visual analog scale (VAS) for assessing pain and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) for measuring pain intensity, joint stiffness, and functional capacity were employed to assess clinical outcomes. Pre‐ and post‐treatment fecal specimens underwent 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing to analyze the gut microbiota. RESULTS The ET group showed higher rates of “effective” and “markedly effective” outcomes. The VAS score of the ET group remained significantly lower than that of the EA group (P < 0.001) immediately after treatment and 1 week post‐treatment. The total WOMAC score (P < 0.001), pain (P = 0.191), stiffness (P = 0.015), and function scores (P < 0.001) decreased significantly in the ET group post‐treatment. The gut microbiota analysis revealed no significant changes in alpha diversity in either group. Beta‐diversity analysis indicated distinct patterns in the ET group before and after treatment. Significant changes in microbial abundance were detected in both groups, highlighting variations in Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. CONCLUSION ET outperforms EA alone in improving KOA pain, stiffness, and function, potentially via gut microbiota modulation, intestinal barrier protection, and inflammation reduction."
"Probiotics and dietary intervention modulate the colonic mucosa-associated microbiota in high-fat diet populations","Qian, L; Huang, J; Qin, H","Turkish journal of gastroenterology","10.5152/tjg.2020.19013","31","4","2020","BACKGROUND/AIMS: Alterations in the gut microbiota due to a high‐fat diet and diet‐induced illness have been found in both mouse models and humans. Observational studies suggest that probiotic administration and diet shifts may treat diet‐related diseases. However, the effect of these interventions on the colonic mucosa has not yet been elucidated. This study investigated the efficacy of probiotic supplementation and dietary intervention as prophylactic tools under high‐fat diet conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 36 volunteers that normally consumed a high‐fat diet were enrolled and treated with either a control diet, a low‐fat dietary intervention, Bifidobacterium triple viable capsule therapy, or a combination of a low‐fat diet and Bifidobacterium triple viable capsule therapy. Pyrosequencing of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA genes was conducted to determine the extent to which probiotics and dietary intervention altered the mucosal microbiota. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that interventional treatment with probiotics and a low‐fat diet increased the diversity of the mucosal microbes, dietary intervention alone produced the most significant effect, whereas the combined intervention exhibited no synergetic improvement. Pyrosequencing demonstrated that probiotics and dietary intervention significantly elevated the abundance of some bacterial taxa assigned to the phylum Firmicutes and the beneficial genera Prevotella, Gemmiger, Coprococcus, and Faecalibacterium and reduced some harmful bacterial taxa assigned to the phylum Proteobacteria and genus Streptophyta. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggested that the addition of probiotics and dietary intervention could improve the composition of the colonic mucosal microbiota in high‐fat diet populations."
"Associations between enteric pathogen carriage and height-for-age, weight-for-age and weight-for-height in children under 5 years old in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh","Berendes, D; Capone, D; Knee, J; Holcomb, D; Sultana, S; Pickering, AJ; Brown, J","Epidemiology and infection","10.1017/S0950268820000369","148",NA,"2020","Nutritional factors and infectious agents may contribute to paediatric growth deficits in low‐ and middle‐income countries; however, the contribution of enteric pathogens is only beginning to be understood. We analysed the stool from children <5 years old from an open cohort, cluster‐randomised controlled trial of a point‐of‐collection water chlorinator in urban Bangladesh. We compared the presence/absence of 15 enteric pathogens detected via multiplex, molecular methods in the stool with concurrent Z‐scores/Z‐score cut‐offs (‐2 standard deviations (s.d.)) for height‐for‐age (HAZ/stunting), weight‐for‐age (WAZ/underweight) and weight‐for‐height (WHZ/wasting), adjusted for sociodemographic and trial‐related factors, and measured caregiver‐reported diarrhoea. Enteric pathogen prevalence in the stool was high (88% had ≥1 enteric pathogen, most commonly Giardia spp. (40%), Salmonella enterica (33%), enterotoxigenic E. coli (28%) and Shigella spp. (27%)) while reported 7‐day diarrhoea prevalence was 6%, suggesting high subclinical infection rates. Many children were stunted (26%) or underweight (24%). Adjusted models suggested Giardia spp. detection was associated with lower HAZ (‐0.22 s.d., 95% CI ‐0.44 to 0.00; prevalence ratio for stunting: 1.39, 95% CI 0.94‐2.06) and potentially lower WAZ. No pathogens were associated with reported diarrhoea in adjusted models. Giardia spp. carriage may be associated with growth faltering, but not diarrhoea, in this and similar low‐income settings. Stool‐based enteric pathogen detection provides a direct indication of previous exposure that may be useful as a broader endpoint of trials of environmental interventions."

However, MDA, as a stand‐alone intervention, does not prevent reinfection. Accordingly, complementary measures to prevent STH reinfection, such as health education and improved sanitation, as part of an integrated control approach, are required to augment the effectiveness of MDA for optimal efficiency and sustainability. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the impact and generalizability of a school‐based health education package entitled The Magic Glasses for STH prevention in the Philippines. METHODS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled intervention trial, involving 2020 schoolchildren aged 9‐10 years, in 40 schools in Laguna Province, Philippines, to evaluate the impact of the school‐based health education package for the prevention of STHs. The trial was conducted over the course of 1 year (June 2016 to July 2017). A total of 20 schools were randomly assigned to the intervention arm, in which The Magic Glasses Philippines health education package was delivered with the standard health education activities endorsed by the Philippines Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of Education (DepEd). The other 20 schools comprised the control arm of the study, where the DOH/DepEd's standard health education activities were done. At baseline, parasitological assessments and a knowledge, attitude, and practice survey were carried out in all schools. In addition, height, weight, and hemoglobin levels were obtained from each child (after parental consent), and their school attendance and academic performance in English and mathematics were accessed from the school records. The baseline and 2 follow‐up surveys were completed using the same study measurements and quality‐control assessments. RESULTS: Key results from this cluster randomized intervention trial will shed light on the impact that The Magic Glasses health education package will have against STH infections in schoolchildren in the province of Laguna, located on the Island of Luzon, in the Calabarzon Region of the Philippines. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the trial will be used to assess the generalizability of the impact of The Magic Glasses health education package in different epidemiological and cultural settings, providing evidence for translation of this health education package into public health policy and practice in the Asian region and beyond.

We aimed to assess the CDED in adults with Crohn's disease. Methods: We did an open‐label, pilot randomised trial at three medical centres in Israel. Eligible patients were biologic naive adults aged 18–55 years with mild‐to‐moderate Crohn's disease (defined by a Harvey–Bradshaw Index score of 5–14 points), a maximal disease duration of 5 years, with active disease on colonoscopy, or imaging with elevated inflammatory markers (C‐reactive protein >5 mg/L or faecal calprotectin concentration >200 μ/g). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to CDED plus partial enteral nutrition or CDED alone for 24 weeks. Randomisation was via block randomisation (block sizes of six) using sealed, numbered, and opaque envelopes. Patients and investigators were aware of which group patients were assigned to due to the nature of the different interventions. The primary endpoint was clinical remission, defined as a Harvey–Bradshaw Index score of less than 5 at week 6. The primary endpoint was assessed in the intention‐to‐treat (ITT) population, which included all patients who used the dietary therapy for at least 48 h. We report results of the final analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02231814. Findings: Between Jan 12, 2017, and May 11, 2020, 91 patients were screened, of whom 44 were randomly assigned to the CDED plus partial enteral nutrition group (n=20) or CDED alone group (n=24). 19 patients in the CDED plus partial enteral nutrition group and 21 patients in the CDED alone group received the allocated intervention for at least 48 h and thus were included in the ITT analysis. At week 6, 13 (68%) of 19 patients in the CDED plus partial enteral nutrition group and 12 (57%) of 21 patients in the CDED group had achieved clinical remission (p=0·4618). Among the 25 patients in remission at week 6, 20 (80%) were in sustained remission at week 24 (12 patients in the CDED plus partial enteral nutrition group and eight in the CDED alone group). 14 (35%) of 40 patients were in endoscopic remission at week 24 (eight patients in the CDED plus partial enteral nutrition group and six in the CDED alone group). No serious adverse events or treatment‐related adverse events were reported in either group. Interpretation: CDED with or without partial enteral nutrition was effective for induction and maintenance of remission in adults with mild‐to‐moderate biologic naive Crohn's disease and might lead to endoscopic remission. These data suggest that CDED could be used for mild‐to‐moderate active Crohn's disease and should be assessed in a powered randomised controlled trial.

US data showed a 70% enrollment reduction in April and a 38% reduction in July 2020, compared to prepandemic rates. We implemented processes during the initial phase of the pandemic to minimize participant and staff viral exposure, develop remote procedures, and ease communication barriers, while still maintaining enrollment goals. Methods: Our stroke research team developed multiple processes to help mitigate pandemic effects on our enrollment. We developed watchlists for eligible and interested patients who could not be enrolled due to national and local restrictions. As research staff was unable to approach patients in person, phone and email scripts were developed to ensure information was disseminated in a consistent fashion. Remote and alternate consent methods were implemented. We tracked the evolving national and local guideline changes, and began re‐opening trials on May 23, 2020. We implemented a rotating pool of coordinators, including a site‐specific sanitation plan, once it was safe to be on campus in‐person. In person meetings were moved to a virtual platform. Enrollment data across for 10 active subacute stroke studies, each active over the 3 years of, 2018‐2020, was analyzed for the months from March to June, with 2020 individually compared to 2018 and 2019 via the Student T‐Test. Results: Total enrollment during these 4 months were 15 participants in 2018, 11 in 2019, and 15 in 2020, with no statistical difference between the years. No study patients nor staff contracted symptoms of COVID‐19. Conclusion: Enrollment shows no significant changes despite COVID‐19. New processes allowedthe timely reopening of clinical trials, an overall maintenance of enrollment rates, including a non‐significant increase in 2020 compared to previous years. Our telehealth and virtual communicationfocused processes prioritize the safety of patients and staff while ensuring quality control andappropriate enrollment numbers."

However, few studies have been conducted to investigate whether IN is effective even in treatment‐refractory cases, such as in those with steroid dependency and anti‐TNF refractoriness. METHODS: In the INDIGO study, 86 patients with active UC were randomly assigned to an IN group (0.5‐2.0 g daily) or placebo group. The rate of clinical response (CR), mucosal healing (MH), and change in fecal calprotectin (FCP) levels was compared between refractory [patients with steroid‐dependent disease, previous use of anti‐TNF‐α, and concomitant use of immunomodulators (IM)] and non‐refractory patients. We also analyzed factors predicting CR and MH at week 8. RESULTS: The rates of CR of IN group were significantly higher than placebo group, even in patients with steroid‐dependent disease (p < 0.001), previous use of anti‐TNF‐α (p = 0.002), and concomitant use of IM (p = 0.013). The rates of MH in IN group were significantly higher than in placebo group in patients with steroid‐dependent disease (p = 0.009). In the IN group, median FCP levels, at week 8, were significantly lower than baseline in patients with steroid‐dependent disease and patients with the previous use of anti‐TNF‐α (p < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that the previous use of anti‐TNF‐α was not a predictive factor for CR and MH at week 8. CONCLUSIONS: In a sub‐analysis of data from a randomized placebo‐controlled trial, we found that IN may be useful even in patients with steroid‐dependent disease and patients with the previous use of anti‐TNF‐α."
"Effects of a protease inhibitor camostat mesilate on gut microbial function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a pilot randomized placebo-controlled study","Kanazawa, M; Miyamoto, K; Kano, M; Inooka, K; Oka, K; Takahashi, M; Mano, N; Fukudo, S","Digestion","10.1159/000542758","106","4","2025","INTRODUCTION: Increased fecal protease activity, which may induce visceral hypersensitivity, has been observed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Serine proteases modulate FK506 binding protein (FKBP)‐type peptidylprolyl cis‐trans isomerase (PPIase) activity associated with immune and glucocorticoid receptor functions. The aim was to investigate whether camostat mesilate (CM), a serine protease inhibitor, modifies fecal bacterial function related to FKBP‐type PPIases in patients with IBS. METHODS: Randomly assigned 16 patients with IBS received 200 mg po tid of CM and 16 patients received placebo for 14 days. Self‐reported adequate relief (AR) as a primary endpoint, IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS‐SSS), and colonic motor and pain thresholds to colorectal distention were assessed before and after treatment. The fecal bacterial content was inferred from 16S rRNA gene sequence data using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. RESULTS: CM significantly increased the relative abundance of Streptococcus and the functional abundances of serine protease and FKBP‐type PPIase FkpA, FklB and SlyD more than placebo after treatment. CM treatment was not superior to placebo in proportion of AR although colonic motor response partially changed. CONCLUSION: CM modulated the fecal microbiome composition and functional potentials that are related to FKBP‐type PPIase activity in IBS patients. These findings suggest that protease inhibitors may modify gut microbial function along with abnormal immunological and/or stress responses that underlie pathophysiology of IBS."
"Comparison of enhanced recovery after surgery protocol and conventional approach after laparoscopic transperitoneal radical prostatectomy: a retrospective analysis","Guleser, AS; Basaga, Y; Karadag, MA","African journal of urology","10.1186/s12301-021-00233-y","27","1","2021","Background: Although open radical prostatectomy has been used in the treatment of localized prostate cancer for a long time, minimally invasive surgical approaches such as laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot‐assisted radical prostatectomy have recently gained importance in order to improve postoperative results and shorten hospital stay. Although the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol was first defined for gastrointestinal surgeries in 2001, it has now been used in gynecological, orthopedic, thoracic and urological surgeries. In our study, we aimed to compare the results of the ERAS protocol with the conventional approach in patients who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Methods: There is a retrospective analysis of 70 patients who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy at Kayseri City Hospital between May 2018 and January 2021. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows, version 25.0 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA). Seventy patients were included in the study. While 48 patients who underwent perioperative care with the traditional approach were included in the conventional group, 22 patients were included in the ERAS group. Age, comorbidities, preoperative PSA level, digital rectal examination findings, preoperative imaging, extra prostatic spread and lymph node involvement, location of tumors, time between biopsy and surgery, lymphadenectomy status, and histopathological findings of transrectal ultrasound biopsy and prostatectomy specimens were recorded for each patient. Initiation of enteral feeding, time to first defecation, duration of antibiotic use, ileus development rate and length of hospital stay (LOS) were compared for both groups. Results: The mean age of 48 patients in the conventional group was 63.37 ± 7.01 years, while the mean age of 22 patients in the ERAS group was 66.36 ± 5.31 years (p = 0.080). Although the first defecation time was shorter in the ERAS group (4.75 ± 3.21 vs. 3.73 ± 2.12 days, p = 0.179), there was no statistically significant difference. Ileus developed in 10 (20.8%) patients in the conventional group and 2 (9.1%) in the ERAS group. Use of antibiotics in the postoperative period in the conventional group (5.83 ± 3.62 vs. 3.18 ± 2.42 days, p = 0.003) and LOS (7.92 ± 3.26 vs. 5.91 ± 2, 15 days, p = 0.011) were statistically significantly longer. Conclusion: In summary, ERAS protocol is associated with short LOS, time to initiation of enteral feeding and duration of antibiotics use. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of ileus and time to first defecation between the two groups. Randomized prospective studies on heterogeneous and larger patient groups are needed to confirm our findings."

Beta‐lactams are the most commonly used antibiotics for treating DFIs. However, the use of antibiotics may lead to disruption of the healthy balance of the gut microbiota, causing dysbiosis. METHODS: Patients with infected diabetic foot ulcers (iDFUs) were treated with two kinds of beta‐lactams (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ceftazidime) according to microbial sensitivity of causative agents via bolus or continuous administration modes. Changes in the gut microbiome of patients were analyzed. Diabetic patients without iDFUs were used as a control group. 16 S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed on stool samples collected from participants. RESULTS: Alpha diversity and beta diversity of gut microbiota of treated patients did not show significant differences between bolus and continuous modes. However, significant differences were observed between gut microbiota diversity of treated patients and control group. PCoA plots showed individualized responses of the patient's gut microbiota to antibiotics at different times using both administration forms associated with the pre‐treatment state of microbiota composition. Enterococcus, Sellimonas, and Lachnoclostridium were the common bacterial markers differentially abundant in the gut microbiota of antibiotic‐treated patients with iDFUs while Roseburia, Dorea, and Monoglobus were mainly abundant in the gut microbiota of patients without iDFUs. Predicted pathways like ""Transporters"", ""ABC transporters"" and ""Phosphotranspherase system (PTS)"" were upregulated in the gut microbiome of patients treated with bolus regime which may lead to increased intestinal barrier permeability. CONCLUSION: The present study reported alterations in gut microbiota composition and functionality and provided the bacterial markers as well as potential metabolic signatures associated with each administration mode in patients with iDFUs, which may be used as a reference set for future studies of the effect of antibiotics administration on the gut microbiome of patients with iDFUs. This study shed light on the importance of understanding the effect of antibiotic administration form on gut microbiome in patients with iDFUs.

Few studies have been conducted in low‐income settings where childhood malnutrition is common and possibly related to microbiota composition. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether gut microbiota composition in young children and their mothers is associated with different environmental exposures in rural Malawi. We hypothesized that more adverse environmental exposures would be associated with lower levels of microbiota maturity and diversity. METHODS: Faecal samples from up to 631 children and mothers participating in a nutrition intervention trial were collected at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 30 months (children) and at 1 month (mothers) after birth and analysed for microbiota composition with 16S rRNA sequencing. Bacterial OTU and genus abundances, measures of microbiota maturity and diversity, and UniFrac distances were compared between participants with different environmental exposures. The exposure variables included socio‐economic status, water source, sanitary facility, domestic animals, maternal characteristics, season, antibiotic use, and delivery mode. RESULTS: Measures of microbiota maturity and diversity in children were inversely associated with maternal education at 6, 18, and 30 months and did not otherwise differ consistently between participants with different environmental exposures. Phylogenetic distance was related to season of stool sample collection at all time points. At the level of individual OTUs and genera, season of stool sample collection, type of water source, and maternal education showed most associations with child gut microbiota, while HIV status was the most important predictor of relative OTU and genus abundances in mothers. CONCLUSION: The results do not support the hypothesis that adverse environmental exposures are broadly associated with lower microbiota maturity and diversity but suggest that environmental exposures influence the abundance of several bacterial OTUs and genera and that low maternal education is associated with higher microbiota maturity and diversity."

Previous studies show that probiotics and proton‐pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 blockers could control diarrhea associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). This study aims to determine and compare the efficacy of a short course of oral ranitidine and a probiotic in the treatment of toddler's diarrhea. Methods: This study was a parallel‐group randomized controlled trial (RCT). We sequentially enrolled 40 patients who met the eligibility criteria. We randomly assigned 20 patients to the oral ranitidine group, ten patients to the probiotic group, and ten patients to the placebo group. In the oral ranitidine group, patients received oral ranitidine (3 mg/kg/day) once daily for 10 days; in the probiotic and placebo groups, they were administered 5 to 10 billion colony‐forming units (CFUs) per day of lyophilized Lactobacillus rhamnosus and 50 mg of once‐daily oral vitamin C tablet respectively for 10 days. Stool frequency and consistency on the 10th day of the interventions were recorded as the primary outcomes. We used the Student's t‐test to determine if there were significant differences in the mean daily stool frequencies in the three intervention groups. A p‐value < 0.05 was adopted as the level of statistical significance. Results: In the ranitidine group, stool frequency decreased significantly from an average of five per day on the first day to an average of approximately one per day on the 10th day of intervention (t = 10.462, p < 0.001). Additionally, stool consistency normalized on the 10th day of intervention. In the probiotic group, there was a significant reduction in stool frequency from an average of five per day on the first day to four per day on the 10th day (t = 2.586, p = 0.041), although stool consistency remained loose. However, stool consistency and frequency were not significantly affected in the placebo group (t = 1.964, p = 0.072). Conclusion: Oral ranitidine is more effective than probiotics in reducing stool frequency and normalizing stool consistency in toddler's diarrhea. We recommend multi‐center trials with appropriate study designs to confirm and validate this finding. Trial registration: ISRCTN, ISRCTN10783996. Registered 8 April 2016‐Registered retrospectively."

To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the drug Viferon®, rectal suppositories (RS) in the complex therapy of viral meningitis (VM) based on the dynamics of clinical and laboratory parameters in children. Patients and methods. A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the drug Viferon® (recombinant interferon α‐2b) in the complex therapy of VM in children. The study included 140 children from 2 to 18 years old, who made up two groups: group 1 (n = 70) received CP Viferon® in age doses: up to 3 years – 500.000 IU; from 4 to 11 years – 1.000.000 IU; from 12 to 18 years – 3.000.000 IU each. Viferon® was prescribed 1 suppository 2 times a day for 7 days, then 1 time a day for 7 days. The 2nd group (n = 70) consisted of children with VM who received placebo, RS according to the scheme of the Viferon®.The children were randomized by gender, age, weight and severity of the VM. The effectiveness of therapy was evaluated based on the duration of clinical symptoms, the dynamics of pleocytosis and rehabilitation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on day 15, the frequency of complete recovery on day 15, after 1, 3 and 6 months. The safety of using of the Viferon® was assessed according to the state of clinical and laboratory parameters, frequency and severity of adverse events. Results. The etiology of VM was determined in 64.3% of cases (n = 90) and included herpes viruses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 type, enteroviruses, tick‐borne encephalitis virus. It was found that children of group 1 had significantly shorter duration of meningeal, cerebral and intoxication syndromes, approximately 2 times less pleocytosis on day 15 and CSF sanitation from viruses in all cases, unlike patients of group 2 (p < 0.001). The differences with group 2 were also significant in age subgroups. Patients receiving the Viferon® were more likely to achieve complete clinical recovery on day 15 and did not have a residual deficiency in the outcome in 100% of cases after 3 months. The use of the Viferon® turned out to be safe, did not increase the incidence of the adverse events compared with the 2nd group of children receiving placebo. Conclusion. The use of the Viferon® in children with VM according to the scheme developed by the authors significantly reduces the regression of inflammatory changes and the timing of CSF rehabilitation, the duration of the main clinical symptoms compared with the placebo group, leads to recovery in 100% of cases."

Multi‐variable analyses were performed for clinical biomarkers and VFs for outcome prediction. Changes in VFs pre/post‐FMT and post‐FMT/placebo were analyzed. Results: We included 233 subjects (40 controls, 43 compensated, 30 HE‐only, 20 ascites‐only, 70 both, and 30 infected). Decompensated patients, especially those with infections, had higher VFs coding for siderophores, biofilms, and adhesion factors versus the rest. Biofilm and adhesion VFs from Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus spp associated with death and hospitalizations independent of clinical factors regardless of when all VFs or selected pathogens were analyzed. FMT was associated with reduced VF post‐FMT versus pre‐FMT and post‐placebo groups. Conclusions: Virulence factors from multiple species focused on adhesion and biofilms increased with decompensation and infections, associated with death and hospitalizations independent of clinical factors, and were attenuated with FMT. Strategies focused on targeting multiple virulence factors could potentially impact outcomes in cirrhosis.

"Rifaximin is efficacious for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea in patients receiving concomitant antidepressants","Laitman, AP; Heimanson, Z; Schoenfeld, PS","Journal of general internal medicine","10.1007/s11606-020-05890-3","35","SUPPL 1","2020","BACKGROUND: A high prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as depression, has been reported in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Rifaximin, a nonsystemic antibiotic, is indicated in the United States for the treatment of adults with IBS with diarrhea (IBS‐D). In the current post hoc analysis, rifaximin for the treatment of IBS‐D (TARGET 3 study) was assessed in a subgroup of adults receiving concomitant antidepressants. METHODS: Adults diagnosed with IBS received placebo for 10 ± 3 days and completed a daily symptom diary during a single‐blind screening phase. During the placebo screening phase, patients who rated their abdominal pain ≥3 (scale range, 0‐10) and bloating ≥3 (scale range, 0‐6) and had mushy/watery stool (Bristol Stool Scale [BSS] type 6/7) for ≥2 days in a week (ie, IBS‐D) were eligible to receive open‐label rifaximin 550 mg three times daily for 2 weeks. In the original protocol, patients could continue taking antidepressants if they were on a stable dose for ≥6 weeks before study entry. Efficacy response was defined using a composite as well as individual assessment of abdominal pain (≥30% decrease from baseline in mean weekly pain score) and stool consistency (≥50% decrease from baseline in number of days/week with BSS type 6/7) during ≥2 of the first 4 weeks post‐treatment. Additional symptoms response assessments included bloating (≥1‐point decrease in weekly average bloating score), bowel movement urgency (≥30% improvement in percentage of days with urgency), and daily global IBS symptoms (≥1‐point decrease in weekly average IBS symptoms score) during ≥2 of the first 4 weeks post‐treatment. RESULTS: 500 of 2579 patients with IBS‐D were taking stable doses of antidepressants during the 2‐week rifaximin treatment phase; 2438 in the overall group and 473 patients in the concomitant antidepressant subgroup were evaluable for efficacy. A total of 44.1% (1074/2438) and 44.6% (211/473) of patients in the overall group and concomitant antidepressant subgroup, respectively, were abdominal pain plus stool consistency (composite) responders, 56.8% (1384/2438) and 61.3% (290/473), respectively, were responders for the individual component of abdominal pain, and 60.1% (1466/2438) and 57.9% (274/473), respectively, were responders for the individual component of stool consistency. In addition, 56.2% (1369/2438) and 57.5% (272/473) for the overall group and concomitant antidepressant subgroup, respectively, were bloating responders, 52.3% (1276/2438) and 56.4% (267/473), respectively, were bowel movement urgency responders, and 57.5% (1401/2438) and 61.5% (291/473), respectively, were daily global IBS symptom responders. Adverse events reported in ≥2.0% of patients in the concomitant antidepressant subgroup were sinusitis (2.8% [14/500]) and urinary tract infection (2.0% [10/500]). CONCLUSIONS: A 2‐week course of rifaximin 550 mg three times daily improved symptoms in adults with IBS‐D taking concomitant antidepressants, and rifaximin was well tolerated."

Data on the genetic diversity of HAstV in Nigeria are limited. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of classical HAstV in children under 5 years of age with acute gastroenteritis in Ogun State, Nigeria. Fecal samples (331) as well as socio‐demographic and clinical data were collected across the three senatorial districts of the state from February 2015 to April 2017. One hundred seventy‐five samples were randomly selected and analyzed for the presence of HAstV using RT‐PCR. PCR amplicons from positive samples were sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis was done to determine genotypes and lineages. The overall prevalence rate was 19.4% (34), with the highest occurrence observed in 2015 (41.4%). Viral coinfections were detected in 13 cases (38.2%). HAstV infection occurred throughout the year and in all age groups, mainly in the age group of 0‐12 months. There was significant association between prevalence rate and collection year; however, no association was observed with gender, age, symptoms or risk factors. HAstV‐5 was the predominant genotype (76.5%) circulating throughout the study period, followed by HAstV‐1 (23.5%), which circulated only in the first 2 years of the study. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all HAstV‐5 strains detected belonged to the 5a lineage, while HAstV‐1 strains were grouped into lineage 1b. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first comprehensive report on molecular characterization of classical HAstV among children with gastroenteritis in the country, and this will serve as baseline information for implementing appropriate infection control practices."

We evaluated the potential impact of a participatory community engagement and innovative community incentivization (C3I) strategy for improving the coverage of child health interventions in a rural setting in Pakistan. We first undertook formative research to assess community knowledge and the likelihood of collective community strategy and conditional incentives for improving existing preventive and care‐seeking practices for childhood diarrhea and pneumonia. We developed options for community incentivization and improving group practices, taking local norms and customs into account in the design of the community mobilization strategies and messages. These interventions were then formally evaluated prospectively in a three‐arm cluster randomized controlled trial. Clusters were randomly assigned by a computer algorithm using restricted randomization by an external statistician (1:1:1) into three groups: community mobilization and incentivization (CMI); community mobilization only using an enhanced communication package (CM); and control group. The C3I was an innovative strategy as it involved serial incremental targets of collective improvement in community behavior related to improvement in the coverage of a composite indicator of fully immunized children (FIC), oral rehydration salt (ORS), and the sanitation index (SI). The evaluation was done by an independent data collection and analysis team at baseline and end line (after 24 months)."
"The effect of alkalinization of oral cavity by sodium bicarbonate mouth wash to decrease ventilator-associated pneumonia in traumatic brain injury patients: a prospective randomized controlled study","Loha, S; Kumar, S; Reena, ; Yadav, G; Jayanthi, A; Rath, A; Banerjee, T; Yadav, RS","Trends in anaesthesia and critical care","10.1016/j.tacc.2022.08.004","46",NA,"2022","Background: Traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of death and disability among trauma patients. They are often in need of mechanical ventilation and intensive care. Due to the lower immunity secondary to trauma, they acquire nosocomial infections quickly. Of them, ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP) is very common. The microaspiration of the oral secretions containing the pathologic flora results in VAP. So, oral hygiene is of paramount importance. Various mouthwashes and rinses are available and are commonly used. We planned to compare the effectiveness of alkalization of oral cavity with 0.9% sodium bicarbonate on the incidence of VAP. Methods: After obtaining ethical committee clearance (IRB/Dean/2019/EC/1783) and written informed consent of the patient's attendants, one hundred eleven patients were randomized into two groups. Group CCC received 2% chlorhexidine mouth wash thrice daily whereas group CCS received 0.9% sodium bicarbonate oral rinse once with 2% chlorhexidine mouth wash twice daily. Our primary outcome was the incidence of VAP using the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) from day one to day five. Comparison of Quantitative bacterial load and oral pH on day 1, day 3 and day 5 was our secondary outcome. Results: There was no statistical difference in the incidence of VAP among both groups from day one to day five (p > 0.05). We didn't find any difference in quantitative bacterial load among both groups on days one, three and five (p > 0.05). There was a statistical difference among both groups on oral pH on day three and day five with group CCS having higher oral pH than group CCC. (p = 0.03 on day 3 and 0.01 on day 5). Conclusion: The alkalization of oral cavity with 0.9% sodium bicarbonate oral rinse along with 2% chlorhexidine mouth wash lowered the incidence of VAP as compared to 2% chlorhexidine mouth wash alone but the difference was not statistically significant."

ENT‐01 inhibits the formation of αS aggregates and improved constipation in an open‐label study in patients with PD. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral ENT‐01 for constipation and neurologic symptoms in patients with PD and constipation. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo‐controlled phase 2b study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03781791). SETTING: Outpatient. PATIENTS: 150 patients with PD and constipation. INTERVENTION: ENT‐01 or placebo daily for up to 25 days. After baseline assessment of constipation severity, daily dosing was escalated to the prokinetic dose, the maximum dose (250 mg), or the tolerability limit, followed by a washout period. MEASUREMENTS: The primary efficacy end point was the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week. Neurologic end points included dementia (assessed using the Mini‐Mental State Examination [MMSE]) and psychosis (assessed using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms adapted for PD [SAPS‐PD]). RESULTS: The weekly CSBM rate increased from 0.7 to 3.2 in the ENT‐01 group versus 0.7 to 1.2 in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Improvement in secondary end points included SBMs (P = 0.002), stool consistency (P < 0.001), ease of passage (P = 0.006), and laxative use (P = 0.041). In patients with dementia, MMSE scores improved by 3.4 points 6 weeks after treatment in the ENT‐01 group (n = 14) versus 2.0 points in the placebo group (n = 14). Among patients with psychosis, SAPS‐PD scores improved from 6.5 to 1.7 six weeks after treatment in the ENT‐01 group (n = 5) and from 6.3 to 4.4 in the placebo group (n = 6). ENT‐01 was well tolerated, with no deaths or drug‐related serious adverse events. Adverse events were predominantly gastrointestinal, including nausea (34.4% [ENT‐01] vs. 5.3% [placebo]; P < 0.001) and diarrhea (19.4% [ENT‐01] vs. 5.3% [placebo]; P = 0.016).

Typhi) is a common cause of morbidity in the world. In 2017, 14.3 million cases of Typhoid and paratyphoid fever occurred globally. School age children between 3 to 19 years old are the most affected. Poor sanitation and multi drug resistance have increased the need for vaccines to reduce the global burden of disease. Based on previous trials, typhoid conjugate vaccines have longer‐ lasting protection, higher efficacy, require fewer doses and are suitable from infancy that allows them to be incorporated into the routine immunization program. Our previous phase I trial proved that a novel Vi‐DT typhoid conjugate vaccine is safe and immunogenic in subjects 2–5 and 18–40 years. Our phase II trial consisted of subjects 6 months to 40 years. Our previously published paper on subjects 6 to < 24 months proved that this vaccine is safe and immunogenic for this age group. Therefore, with this paper we aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity in children 2–11 years. Methods: A randomized, observer‐blind, superiority design of Vi‐DT Typhoid conjugate vaccine compared to Vi‐polysaccharide vaccine (Vi‐PS) phase II study was conducted from October 2018 to December 2018 where 200 subjects aged 2–11 years were recruited. A blood sample prior to vaccination was taken, followed by administration of a single dose of either test vaccine (Vi‐DT) or control vaccine (Vi‐PS) and then a second blood sample was collected 28 days post vaccination. Adverse reactions were assessed and antibody increment was evaluated at 28 days post vaccination through collected serum sample. Results: Pain was the most common local reaction. Fever and muscle pain were the most common systemic reactions. Both Vi‐DT and Vi‐PS groups had roughly the same number of adverse reactions. At 28 days post vaccination, 100% of subjects in the Vi‐DT group and 93% of subjects in the Vi‐PS group produced antibody increment ≥4 times. The Vi‐DT group produced a higher GMT as compared to Vi‐PS. Conclusion: Vi‐DT vaccine is safe and immunogenic in children 2–11 years old. Trial registration: Trial registration number: NCT03460405."

In low‐resource settings, household finished floors (eg, concrete floors) might reduce transmission of soil‐transmitted helminths and G duodenalis. Methods: In a prospective cohort of children nested within two randomised trials in rural Bangladesh and Kenya, we estimated associations between household finished flooring and soil‐transmitted helminths and G duodenalis prevalence. In 2015–16, we collected stool samples from children aged 2–16 years in rural Bangladesh and Kenya. We detected soil‐transmitted helminth infection using quantitative PCR (qPCR; Bangladesh n=2800; Kenya n=3094), and G duodenalis using qPCR in Bangladesh (n=6894) and ELISA in Kenya (n=8899). We estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) using log‐linear models adjusted for potential confounders. Findings: 7187 (92·2%) of 7795 children in Bangladesh and 9077 (93·7%) of 9686 children in Kenya provided stool specimens that were analysed by qPCR. At enrolment, 691 (10%) households in Bangladesh and 471 (5%) households in Kenya had finished floors. In both countries, household finished flooring was associated with lower Ascaris lumbricoides prevalence (Bangladesh aPR 0·33, 95% CI 0·14–0·78; Kenya 0·62, 0·39–0·98) and any soil‐transmitted helminths (Bangladesh 0·73, 0·52–1·01; Kenya 0·57, 0·37–0·88). Household finished floors were also associated with lower Necator americanus prevalence in Bangladesh (0·52, 0·29–0·94) and G duodenalis prevalence in both countries (Bangladesh 0·78, 0·64–0·95; Kenya 0·82, 0·70–0·97). Interpretation: In low‐resource settings, living in households with finished floors over a 2‐year period was associated with lower prevalence of G duodenalis and some soil‐transmitted helminths in children.

The primary endpoint was the change in interleukin‐6 from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints were evaluation of the gut microbiota in feces and blood, fecal organic acids, high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein, lipopolysaccharide‐binding protein, and glycemic control. Synbiotic administration for 24 weeks did not significantly affect changes in interleukin‐6 from baseline to 24 weeks (0.35 ± 1.99 vs. −0.24 ± 1.75 pg/mL, respectively). Relative to baseline, however, at 24 weeks after synbiotic administration there were positive changes in the counts of Bifidobacterium and total lactobacilli, the relative abundances of Bifidobacterium species such as Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and the concentrations of acetic and butyric acids in feces. No significant changes in inflammatory markers were found in the synbiotic group compared to the control group.

Not all individuals exposed to Shigella or other enteropathogens have symptomatic responses, and investigating the differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals can further our understanding of enteropathogen proliferation and symptomatic responses. Here, we profiled the fecal microbiomes of 45 individuals infected with Shigella sonnei strain 53G through 16S rRNA sequencing in a controlled human infection model before and during infection, after antibiotic treatment, and after clinical recovery. This model allowed for a detailed exploration of microbiome temporal dynamics during infection, as well as a comparative analysis between those with shigellosis (defined as severe symptoms caused by Shigella infection, including severe diarrhea, fever, and/or abdominal pain) and those without shigellosis. Alpha diversity decreased to a greater degree in individuals with shigellosis. Perturbations in microbial composition during infection and antibiotic treatment were significantly larger in individuals diagnosed with shigellosis than in those who were not. Participants with shigellosis had persistent changes to their microbiomes after recovery, while those without shigellosis recovered to a composition resembling their pre‐infection microbiomes. These persistent changes included taxa associated with gut inflammation, such as a decrease in Faecalibacterium and an increase in Ruminococcus gnavus. Furthermore, the initial microbiomes of participants who did not develop shigellosis had a greater abundance of taxa associated with short‐chain fatty acid production than participants who did develop shigellosis, including Bifidobacterium, Roseburia, and Faecalibacterium. These data could help prevent Shigella infection or symptoms.IMPORTANCEDiarrheal disease is a major contributor to the global disease burden and can lead to an increased individual risk of chronic sequelae post‐infection, such as irritable bowel syndrome, reactive arthritis, and altered gut permeability. Understanding the differential responses of individuals to enteropathogen exposure can elucidate factors that could lead to treatments or preventative measures to reduce the disease burden. Here, we use a controlled human infection model study to directly identify the effects of Shigella sonnei 53G infection on the microbiome. We identified taxa that were more or less abundant in participants who would develop shigellosis during the study, as well as persistent changes after recovery in the microbiomes of participants who developed severe symptoms. Understanding these changes could elucidate ways to prevent Shigella infection or recover altered microbiomes after recovery.CLINICAL TRIALSThis study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT02816346."

Odevixibat, an orally administered, selective inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter, is in development to treat cholestatic liver diseases. We describe the safety and tolerability of odevixibat in children with PFIC during the phase 3 PEDFIC 1 and PEDFIC 2 studies. Efficacy results from PEDFIC 1 and interim results from PEDFIC 2 have been previously presented: odevixibat improved pruritus, cholestasis, and growth with durable effect. Methods: In the double‐blind PEDFIC 1 study (NCT03566238), 62 children with PFIC (PFIC1: 27%; PFIC2: 73%) were randomised to placebo (Pbo; n=20), odevixibat 40 μg/kg/day (Odevix40; n=23), or odevixibat 120 μg/kg/day (Odevix120; n=19) for 24 weeks. PEDFIC 2, an ongoing, open‐label extension study (NCT03659916), enrolled either patients from PEDFIC 1 (ie, cohort 1) or new patients with any PFIC subtype (ie, cohort 2); a total of 69 patients (PFIC1: 26.1%; PFIC2: 65.2%; PFIC3: 7.2%; 1 patient with MYO5B variant: 1.4%) were included. Interim PEDFIC 2 data through July 15, 2020 are included here, covering data from 24 weeks of treatment with odevixibat 120 μg/kg/day. Standard safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), laboratory monitoring, and physical examinations. Patients with PFIC may have multiple comorbidities (eg, altered hepatic parameters, fatsoluble vitamin deficiencies, diarrhoea); therefore, these were examined as AEs of interest. Results: In PEDFIC 1, the incidence of drug‐related treatment‐emergent AEs (TEAEs) was 33.3% among all odevixibat‐treated patients and 15.0% with Pbo; drug‐related TEAEs of diarrhoea/frequent bowel movement occurred in 9.5% and 5.0%, respectively (Table). Only 1 patient discontinued study medication due to an AE (diarrhoea, Odevix120 arm). In PEDFIC 2, the incidence of drug‐related TEAEs was comparable in cohorts 1 and 2 (range: 26.3%‐31.3%). Overall, 20 of 69 patients (29%) experienced drug‐related TEAEs. The most common drug‐related TEAEs (Table) were laboratory abnormalities, including raised ALT and total bilirubin. One patient withdrew from PEDFIC 2 with an AE (worsening cholestasis) as the primary reason. No deaths or drug‐related serious AEs were reported in the 2 studies. Additionally, there were no clinically significant changes or safety signals noted in mean serum biochemistry, haematology, or urinalysis values based on laboratory assessments or physical examination; no events of liver decompensation; and no new events of fatsoluble vitamin deficiency refractory to clinically recommended vitamin supplementation. Overall, the incidence of gastrointestinal events, and specifically diarrhoea, was low: the majority of these events were mild to moderate in severity and self‐limiting. Conclusion: The observed safety and tolerability profile of odevixibat was consistent across studies, treatment groups, and doses, and there were no new or major safety findings. Odevixibat was generally well tolerated regardless of individual patient characteristics. The safety and tolerability profile of odevixibat supports its use as a potential non‐invasive treatment option for patients with PFIC, which could improve the standard of care in a disease with high unmet medical needs."

Methods: A cross‐sectional study was conducted among randomly selected Egyptian community pharmacists (Center, East, Delta, and Upper Egypt) using a questionnaire and direct interviews from 1 to 30 August 2020. The questionnaire consisted of two parts, the first covered pharmacist's demographic data and their application of basic infection preventive practices (eg, wearing face masks, regular hand sanitization, etc), and the other part was related to antibiotic dispensing patterns. Data were descriptively analyzed and the impact of participant experience on the responses was evaluated using the χ2 test. Results: From 480 randomly selected Egyptian community pharmacists, 413 (87%) consented to participate in the study. 86.7% of the participants were keen to wear face masks (n = 358) and 86.2% kept regular hand sanitization (n = 356); whereas, 46.9% (n = 194) maintained adequate antibiotic stock supply during the pandemic. Nearly 67% (n = 275) of the pharmacists reported that patients were more likely to be given antibiotics for showing any sign or symptom of COVID‐19 infection, and 82% (n = 74 278) of the dispensed antibiotics were given upon physician recommendation. Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone, and Linezolid were the major antibiotics dispensed to COVID‐19 presumptive patients Azithromycin was given to 40% of presumptive patients showing only mild or moderate symptoms for 5‐10 days. Additionally, antibiotic combinations were given to 74% (n = 62 479) of home‐isolated patients for a maximum of 2 weeks. Conclusions: Pharmacists applied suitable sanitation and infection control protocols. Meanwhile, antibiotics were dispensed heavily during this pandemic without proper clinical indication and for long durations supporting the idea of antibiotic misuse."
"Effects of a formula with a probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis Supplement on the gut microbiota of low birth weight infants","Chi, C; Xue, Y; Liu, R; Wang, Y; Lv, N; Zeng, H; Buys, N; Zhu, B; Sun, J; Yin, C","European journal of nutrition","10.1007/s00394-019-02006-4","59","4","2020","PURPOSE: Low birth weight (LBW) infants have a less diverse gut microbiota, enriched in potential pathogens, which places them at high risk of systemic inflammation diseases. This study aimed to identify the differences in gut bacterial community structure between LBW infants who received probiotics and LBW infants who did not receive probiotics. METHODS: Forty‐one infants were allocated to the non‐probiotic group (N group) and 56 infants to the probiotic group (P group), according to whether the formula they received contained a probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis. Gut bacterial composition was identified with sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in fecal samples collected at 14 days after birth. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the alpha diversity of the two groups, while the beta diversity was significantly different (p < 0.05). Our results showed that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (both p < 0.05) were enriched in the P group, while Veillonella, Dolosigranulum and Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (all p < 0.05) were enriched in the N group. Predicted metagenome function analysis revealed enhancement of fatty acids, peroxisome, starch, alanine, tyrosine and peroxisome pathways in the P group, and enhancement of plant pathogen, Salmonella and Helicobacter pylori infection pathways in the N group. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic supplement in formula may affect the composition, stability and function of LBW infants' gut microbiota. LBW infants who receive probiotic intervention may benefit from gut microbiota that contains more beneficial bacteria."
"Effects of Two Compound Probiotic Formulations on Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Gut Microbiota: a 4-Week Randomized, Double-Blind Intervention Trial","Qu, Z; Wu, Y; Jiang, Y; Fan, J; Cao, L; Dong, Y; Fang, S; Gu, S","Nutrients","10.3390/nu17172886","17","17","2025","Background/Objectives: Probiotic interventions can alleviate gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort, but evidence comparing multi‐strain combinations at different doses remains limited. We evaluated whether formulation potency influences clinical and microbiome outcomes. Methods: In a 4‐week, randomized, double‐blind trial, 100 eligible adults received one of two higher‐dose multi‐strain probiotic formulations at different dosages (Wec120B vs Wec300B). Weekly Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) scores tracked symptom trajectories. Gut microbiota composition and diversity were profiled by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Biomarkers included lipopolysaccharide (LPS), fecal calprotectin (FC), and immunoglobulin A (IgA). Results: Results indicated that the Wec120B group showed more significant improvement in abdominal pain during the early phase of intervention, while the Wec300B group was more effective in relieving reflux symptoms. In terms of biomarkers, Wec120B was more effective in reducing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, whereas Wec300B showed a greater increase in immunoglobulin A (IgA) and a more pronounced reduction in fecal calprotectin (FC) levels. Both formulations significantly increased the abundance of beneficial genera such as Bifidobacterium, Blautia, [Eubacterium]_hallii_group, and Anaerostipes, while suppressing the growth of potential pathogens including Prevotella and Escherichia‐Shigella. Conclusions: These findings suggest that both compound probiotic products can significantly improve GI symptoms and modulate gut microbiota structure, with Wec300B showing a superior performance in microbial regulation, likely due to its higher dosage of probiotics. This study provides reference evidence for the rational application of probiotic products in gut health management."
"Does rifaximin offer any promise in Crohn's disease in remission and concurrent irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms?","Tocia, C; Dumitru, IM; Alexandrescu, L; Petcu, LC; Dumitru, E","Medicine","10.1097/MD.0000000000024059","100","1","2021","Microbiota plays an important role in many diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease patients can have concurrent irritable bowel syndrome symptoms similar to those associated with a flare. The potential role of gut dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease provides a rationale for treating such patients with rifaximin. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of rifaximin in the management of irritable bowel syndrome‐like symptoms (bloating, abdominal pain, stool consistency) and quality of life in patients with Crohn's disease in remission.The present study included 86 patients with Crohn's disease in remission (fecal calprotectin <50 μg/g, C‐reactive protein <0.5 mg/dL, simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease <2) and associated irritable bowel syndrome‐like symptoms (bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea). These patients were randomly assigned to rifaximin treatment group (44 patients) and the control group (42 patients). Besides the baseline inflammatory bowel disease treatment and antispasmodics (as needed), patients in the rifaximin treatment group received 3 repeated courses of treatment, each course being represented by 1200 mg/d of rifaximin for 10 days and 20 days free of treatment (3 months consecutively); patients in the control group also received antispamodics as needed and were observed for 3 months.Monthly analyses of bloating score, abdominal pain score, stool consistency score, and quality of life score showed significant improvement after treatment in the rifaximin group in contrast with control group. Significantly more patients in the rifaximin group than in the control group met the criteria for adequate improvement of bloating score after 3 months of treatment (59.09% vs 19.04%, P = .01), adequate improvement of abdominal pain score (54.5% vs 21.4%, P = .04), stool consistency score (34.09% vs 14.2%, P = .03), and quality of life score (70.4% vs 21.4%, P < .001).Rifaximin in a dose of 1200 mg/d, 10 d/mo, 3 months consecutively is an effective medication for concurrent irritable bowel syndrome‐like symptoms in patients with Crohn's disease in remission."

Evidence‐based guidance is needed to inform interventions and future studies. Objectives: We aimed to estimate how sensitive the intervention effectiveness found in the WASH Benefits Bangladesh randomized controlled trial was to underlying WASH contextual and intervention factors (e.g.., baseline disease prevalence, compliance, community coverage, efficacy) and to generalize the results of the trial other contexts or scenarios. Methods: We developed a disease transmission model to account for transmission across multiple environmental pathways, multiple interventions (water (W), sanitation (S), hygiene (H), nutrition (N)) applied individually and in combination, adherence to interventions, and the impact of individuals not enrolled in the study. Leveraging a set of mechanistic parameter combinations fit to the WASH Benefits Bangladesh trial (n=17,187) using a Bayesian sampling approach, we simulated trial outcomes under counterfactual scenarios to estimate how changes in intervention completeness, coverage, compliance, and efficacy, as well as preexisting WASH conditions and baseline disease burden, impacted intervention effectiveness. Results: Increasing community coverage had the greatest impact on intervention effectiveness (e.g., median increases in effectiveness of 34.0 and 45.5% points in the WSH and WSHN intervention arms when increasing coverage to 20%). The effect of community coverage on effectiveness depended on how much transmission was along pathways not modified by the interventions. Intervention effectiveness was reduced by lower levels of preexisting WASH conditions or increased baseline disease burden. Individual interventions had complementary but not synergistic effects when combined. Discussion: To realize the expected health gains, future WASH interventions must address community coverage and transmission along pathways not traditionally covered by WASH. The effectiveness of individual‐level WASH improvements will be blunted the further the community is from the high community coverage needed to achieve herd protection."
"Seroprevalence of chikungunya virus and living conditions in Feira de Santana, Bahia-Brazil","Teixeira, MG; Skalinski, LM; Paixão, ES; Costa, MDCN; Barreto, FR; Campos, GS; Sardi, SI; Carvalho, RH; Natividade, M; Itaparica, M; Dias, JP; Trindade, SC; Teixeira, BP; Morato, V; Santana, EB; Goes, CB; Silva, NSJ; Santos, CAST; Rodrigues, LC; Whitworth, J","PLoS neglected tropical diseases","10.1371/journal.pntd.0009289","15","4","2021","Background Chikungunya is an arbovirus, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, which emerged in the Americas in 2013 and spread rapidly to almost every country on this continent. In Brazil, where the first cases were detected in 2014, it currently has reached all regions of this country and more than 900,000 cases were reported. The clinical spectrum of chikungunya ranges from an acute self‐limiting form to disabling chronic forms. The purpose of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of chikungunya infection in a large Brazilian city and investigate the association between viral circulation and living condition. Methodology/principal findings We conducted a population‐based ecological study in selected Sentinel Areas (SA) through household interviews and a serologic survey in 2016/2017. The sample was of 1,981 individuals randomly selected. The CHIKV seroprevalence was 22.1% (17.1 IgG, 2.3 IgM, and 1.4 IgG and IgM) and varied between SA from 2.0% to 70.5%. The seroprevalence was significantly lower in SA with high living conditions compared to SA with low living condition. There was a positive association between CHIKV seroprevalence and population density (r = 0.2389; p = 0.02033). Conclusions/significance The seroprevalence in this city was 2.6 times lower than the 57% observed in a study conducted in the epicentre of the CHIKV epidemic of this same urban centre. So, the herd immunity in this general population, after four years of circulation of this agent is relatively low. It indicates that CHIKV transmission may persist in that city, either in endemic form or in the form of a new epidemic, because the vector infestation is persistent. Besides, the significantly lower seroprevalences in SA of higher Living Condition suggest that beyond the surveillance of the disease, vector control and specific actions of basic sanitation, the reduction of the incidence of this infection also depends on the improvement of the general living conditions of the population."

There are currently no licensed vaccines for shigellosis but it has been estimated that an effective vaccine could avert 590,000 deaths over a 20‐year period. A challenge to effective Shigella vaccine development has been the low immunogenicity and protective efficacy of candidate Shigella vaccines in infants and young children. Additionally, a new vaccine might be less immunogenic in a highly endemic setting compared to a low endemic setting (""vaccine hyporesponsiveness""). The use of a potent adjuvant enhancing both mucosal and systemic immunity might overcome these problems. InvaplexAR‐Detox is an injectable Shigella vaccine that uses a novel combination of conserved invasion plasmid antigen proteins and a serotype‐specific bacterial lipopolysaccharide attenuated for safe intramuscular administration. The adjuvant dmLT has been shown to enhance Shigella immune responses in mice, has safely been administered intramuscularly, and was shown to enhance immune responses in healthy volunteers when given in combination with other antigens in phase I trials. This article describes the protocol of a study that will be the first to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of InvaplexAR‐Detox co‐administered with dmLT in healthy adults in low‐endemic and high‐endemic settings. METHODS: In a multi‐center, randomized, double‐blind, and placebo‐controlled dose‐escalation phase Ia/b trial, the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of three intramuscular vaccinations administered 4 weeks apart with 2.5 µg or 10 µg of InvaplexAR‐Detox vaccine, alone or in combination with 0.1 µg of the dmLT adjuvant, will first be assessed in a total of 50 healthy Dutch adults (phase Ia) and subsequently in 35 healthy Zambian adults (phase Ib) aged 18‐50 years. The primary outcome is safety, and secondary outcomes are humoral and cellular immune responses to the adjuvanted or non‐adjuvanted vaccine. DISCUSSION: This trial is part of the ShigaPlexIM project that aims to advance the early clinical development of an injectable Shigella vaccine and to make the vaccine available for late‐stage clinical development. This trial addresses the issue of hyporesponsiveness in an early stage of clinical development by testing the vaccine and adjuvant in an endemic setting (Zambia) after the first‐in‐human administration and the dose‐escalation has proven safe and tolerable in a low‐endemic setting (Netherlands). Besides strengthening the vaccine pipeline against a major diarrheal disease, another goal of the ShigaPlexIM project is to stimulate capacity building and strengthen global North‐South relations in clinical research.

Patients and Methods: A total of 150 rectal cancer patients who underwent surgical treatment in our hospital from July 2022 to July 2023 were selected and randomly divided into two groups using a random number table. There were 75 cases in the control group (CG) who underwent traditional open rectal total mesorectal excision surgery and 75 cases in the experimental group (EG) who underwent LGTME. The surgical effects of the two groups were compared, and the gastrointestinal and anal functional recovery of the two groups were compared before and after treatment. Results: Intraoperative bleeding, incision length, time to initial feeding and time to anal exhaust in the EG were significantly lower than those in the CG (P < 0.05). Before treatment, there was no significant difference in gastrointestinal function and anal function between the two groups (P > 0.05). After treatment, the levels of motilin, gastrin, neuropeptide Y and basic fibroblast growth factor in the EG were significantly higher than those in the CG, with statistical significance (P < 0.05); the maximum anal systolic pressure and resting anal sphincter pressure in the EG were significantly lower than those in the CG (P < 0.05); the rectal sensitivity threshold volume (RSTV) and rectal maximum volume threshold in the EG were significantly higher than those in the CG (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in most postoperative complications between the two groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: LGTME improves the surgical effects of rectal cancer patients, promotes the recovery of gastrointestinal function and has a small effect on anal function indicators, thereby reducing hospital stay."
"Pathways through which water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition interventions reduce antibiotic use in young children: a mediation analysis of a cohort nested within a cluster-randomized trial","Nguyen, AT; Heitmann, GB; Mertens, A; Ashraf, S; Rahman, MZ; Ali, S; Rahman, M; Arnold, BF; Grembi, JA; Lin, A; Ercumen, A; Benjamin-Chung, J","EClinicalMedicine","10.1016/j.eclinm.2025.103147","82",NA,"2025","BACKGROUND: Low‐cost, household‐level water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and nutrition interventions can reduce pediatric antibiotic use, but the mechanism through which interventions reduce antibiotic use has not been investigated. METHODS: We conducted a causal mediation analysis using data collected between September 2013 and October 2015 from a cohort nested within the WASH Benefits Bangladesh cluster‐randomized trial (NCT01590095). Among a subsample of children within the WASH, nutrition, nutrition + WASH, and control arms (N = 1409 children; 267 clusters), we recorded caregiver‐reported antibiotic use at ages 14 and 28 months and collected stool at age 14 months. Our primary outcome was any caregiver‐reported antibiotic use by index children within the past 30 or 90 days measured at age 14 and 28 months. Mediators included caregiver‐reported child diarrhea, acute respiratory infection (ARI), and fever; and enteric pathogen carriage in stool measured by qPCR. Both intervention‐mediator and mediator‐outcome models were controlled for mediator‐outcome confounders. FINDINGS: The receipt of any WASH or nutrition intervention reduced caregiver‐reported antibiotic use through all pathways in the past month by 5.5 percentage points (95% CI 1.2, 9.9), from 49.5% (95% CI 45.9%, 53.0%) in the control group to 45.0% (95% CI 42.7%, 47.2%) in the pooled intervention group. When separating this effect into different pathways, we found that interventions reduced antibiotic use by 0.6 percentage points (95% CI 0.1, 1.3) through reduced diarrhea, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI 0.1, 1.5) through reduced ARI with fever, and 1.5 percentage points (95% CI 0.4, 3.0) through reduced prevalence of enteric viruses. Interventions reduced antibiotic use through any of these measured mediators by 2.1 percentage points (95% CI ‐0.3, 4.5). INTERPRETATION: WASH and nutrition interventions reduced pediatric antibiotic use through the prevention of enteric and respiratory infections in a rural, low‐income population. Given that many of these infections are caused by viruses or parasites, WASH and nutrition interventions may help reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in similar settings.

Although the precise cause remains unknown, disturbances in the intestinal microbial community have been linked to its pathogenesis. Randomized controlled trials in UC and relapsing Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) have established fecal microbiota (FM) transfer (FMT) as an effective therapy. In this context, preliminary results indicated that the transfer of sterile fecal microbiota filtrates (<0.2 μm; FMF, FMFT) of donor stool also drives gastrointestinal microbiota changes and eliminates symptoms in CDI patients. However, along with the success of FMT, regulatory agencies issued safety alerts following reports of serious adverse events due to transmission of enteric pathogens through FMT. To reduce this risk, we established an extensive test protocol for our donors and quarantine regulations for the produced capsules, but alternative concepts are desirable. METHODS: Our project is a randomized, controlled, longitudinal, prospective, three‐arm, multicenter, double‐blind study to determine the safety and efficacy of repeated long‐term, multi‐donor FM or FMF transfers compared to placebo using oral, frozen capsules in 174 randomized patients with mild to moderate active UC. The primary outcome will be clinical remission at week 12. DISCUSSION: This proposal aims to examine (a) the efficacy of encapsulated transfer of FM and FMF as a therapy for mild to moderate UC, (b) the short‐ and long‐term safety of FMT and FMFT in patients with UC, and (c) the microbial and immunologic changes that occur after FMT and FMFT to help understand how and why it affects inflammatory bowel disease.

"The effect of a hand hygiene intervention on the behaviour, practices and health of parents of preschool children in South Africa","Lange, S; Barnard, TG; Naicker, N","Perspectives in public health","10.1177/17579139221123404","142","6","2022","INTRODUCTION: Diarrhoea and upper respiratory diseases are a leading cause of child mortality in children under 5 years of age both in South Africa and worldwide. Hand hygiene (HH) interventions play a critical role in reducing HH‐related diseases, and the inclusion of all stakeholders in such interventions has improved the success of such interventions. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of an HH intervention on the behaviour, practices, and health of parents of preschool children. METHODOLOGY: Seventeen preschools were randomly selected and placed into intervention (IG = 8) and control groups (CG = 9). Parents (N = 191) were requested to complete questionnaires both pre‐ and postintervention. An intervention was applied to IG preschool respondents. The data were analysed and compared pre‐ and postintervention between IG and CG. RESULTS: Parents of IG showed a significant difference pre‐ and postintervention in HH practices such as washing hands after coughing and sneezing, and after using the toilet while parents in CG also indicated significant differences in HH practices of washing hands after coughing and sneezing, and after wiping children's noses. Postintervention, IG families reporting runny tummies were significantly less than pre‐intervention and a decrease in doctor's visits. There was a 5% improvement of all HH practices in both IG and CG. CONCLUSION: Over 90% of parents in both groups washed hands after using the toilet, both pre‐ and postintervention. All HH practices for both groups showed increases both pre‐ and postintervention. By making use of available resources and regular communication with parents of preschoolers they are able to make the small changes necessary to improve their HH and that of their families."

AIMS: The present study aimed to evaluate some of these factors. METHODS: This study included 186 patients with IBS randomized 1:1:1 into transplant administered to the colon (single LI), to the duodenum (single SI), or to the duodenum twice with a 1‐week interval (repeated SI). The patients provided a fecal sample and were asked to complete five questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after FMT. The fecal bacteria composition and dysbiosis index (DI) were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene PCR DNA amplification/probe hybridization covering regions V3‐V9. RESULTS: The response rate was significantly higher in single SI than in single LI at 12 months after FMT. Symptoms and quality of life improved in all the treated groups at all time intervals after FMT. The abdominal symptoms were significantly reduced and the quality of life improved for repeated SI compared with for single SI. DI significantly decreased in all the treated groups at all observation times after FMT. The bacterial profiles changed in all groups at all observation intervals. However, these changes differed between single LI and single SI/repeated SI. CONCLUSION: Administrating transplant to the small intestine had a long‐term higher response rate than that administrated to the large intestine, and led to long‐term colonization of beneficial bacteria. Repeating FMT had more effect on symptoms and quality of life than a single FMT. (www. CLINICALTRIALS: gov: NCT04236843)."

This happens, especially in countries (e.g., Nigeria) that have not yet introduced the vaccine into the national immunization program. A significant prevalence of Rotavirus infection both in children and adults without major symptoms has earlier been reported. This study aimed at defining the prevalence of asymptomatic Rotavirus infection from apparently healthy children in Maiduguri, Borno State, Northeastern Nigeria. Methods: A total of 269 stool samples were randomly collected from apparently healthy children <15 years of age from July 2017 to June 2018. All samples were screened using a commercially available enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay kit for the presence of Rotavirus antigen. The Rotavirus‐positive samples were further subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to determine their RNA electropherotypes. Results: A total of 59 stool samples (19.9%) were Rotavirus positive with peaks observed in the cold dry season, among male children, and 6‐10 years of age group. A total of 50 randomly selected Rotavirus‐positive samples were subjected to PAGE, and none of the samples showed either long or short profiles. Conclusion: This study shows that Rotavirus can be shed into environments without any signs and symptoms. In view of this, the Rotavirus vaccine should be considered a priority and be introduced in the existing national immunization program in Nigeria, particularly in Borno State."

Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology","10.1152/ajpregu.00109.2025","329","3","2025","Interactions between the gut microbiota and intestinal barrier may contribute to the pathophysiology of high‐altitude illnesses. This study aimed to determine the effects of targeting the gut microbiota using dietary supplementation with a blend of fermentable fibers and polyphenol sources on gut microbiota composition, fecal short‐chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and intestinal function and permeability during hypobaric hypoxia exposure. Healthy adults participated in a randomized, placebo‐controlled, crossover study. Food products containing oligofructose‐enriched inulin, galacto‐oligosaccharide, high‐amylose corn starch, cocoa, green tea and cranberry extracts, and blueberry powder (FP) or maltodextrin (placebo; PL) were consumed daily during three 2‐wk phases separated by a ≥1‐wk washout. During the final 36 h of each phase, participants resided in a hypobaric chamber simulating low (LA; 500 m) or high (HA; 4,300 m) altitude creating three experimental conditions: PL + LA, PL + HA, and FP + HA. Twenty‐six participants completed ≥1 study phase and 13 [12 male; 21 ± 3 yr; body mass index (BMI) 25.4 ± 2.4 kg/m2] completed all three phases. Results demonstrated that FP mitigated hypoxia‐induced increases in intestinal permeability within the small intestine and proximal colon while increasing Bifidobacterium relative abundance and decreasing gut microbiota α‐diversity and colonic pH. Higher Bifidobacterium relative abundance and lower colonic pH were associated with greater reductions in intestinal permeability. However, FP did not alter fecal SCFA concentrations and increased gastrointestinal symptoms and altitude sickness during hypobaric hypoxia exposure. Findings suggest that targeting the gut microbiota with a combination of fermentable fibers and polyphenols can prevent hypobaric hypoxia‐induced increases in intestinal permeability but that benefit does translate into a reduction in altitude illness symptoms.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Dietary supplementation targeting the gut microbiota may provide novel approaches to improving physiologic responses to environmental stressors such as those experienced during sojourn at high terrestrial altitudes. This study demonstrated that gut microbiota‐targeted dietary supplementation using a blend of fermentable fibers and polyphenol sources can prevent hypobaric hypoxia‐induced decrements in intestinal permeability. Findings support the emerging concept that the gut microbiota may be a modifiable factor influencing physiologic responses in austere environments."

Nasopharyngeal, blood, urine, and stool samples were obtained from each participant at the time of hospital admission, upon discharge, 1 week after discharge, and every 2 weeks until all samples were negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA by reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) assay. A survival analysis was also performed to identify the duration of viral persistence. Results: The median duration of viral RNA persistence in the nasopharyngeal samples was 8 days from the first positive RT‐PCR result upon admission (95% CI 6.91–9.09); the maximum duration of viral shedding was 25 days from admission. Positive blood, urine, and stool RT‐PCR results were detected in 24%, 7%, and 6% of the patients, respectively. The median duration of viral persistence in the blood, urine, and stool samples was 7 days (95% CI 6.07–7.93), 6 days (95% CI 4.16–8.41), and 13 days (95% CI 6.96–19.4), respectively. Also, the maximum duration of viral persistence in the blood, urine, and stool samples was 17, 11, and 42 days from admission, respectively. Conclusion: According to the present results, immediately after the hospitalized patients were discharged, no evidence of viral genetic materials was found. Therefore, appropriate treatments were selected for the patients at this hospital. However, we recommend further investigations on a larger sample size in multi‐center and prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effects of different drugs on the shedding of the virus through body secretions."
"Where and how can WASH work? Understanding limited impacts from a randomized control trial of water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions in a high burden setting","Kraay, ANM; Brouwer, AF; Zahid, MH; Njenga, S; Colford, JM; Freeman, MC; Eisenberg, JNS","medRxiv: the preprint server for health sciences","10.1101/2024.12.03.24318379",NA,NA,"2024","Background: Despite their strong theoretical basis, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions have had inconsistent benefits on diarrhea in low‐ and middle‐income settings. The WASH Benefits (WASH‐B) Kenya randomized controlled trial evaluated a set of WASH interventions targeted at children under age 2 and found no effect on diarrheal prevalence. Objectives: We explored whether and how changes to intervention and contextual factors could impact health gains as a means to inform future WASH interventions. Methods: We implemented a compartmental transmission model with environmental pathways and water (W), sanitation (S), and hygiene (H) interventions fit to WASH‐B Kenya trial data (n=11,856) using a Bayesian sampling approach. We developed counterfactual simulations to predict how a trial might perform given improved 1) local contextual factors (i.e., reduced transmission, and increased completeness of transmission pathways targeted) and/or 2) intervention factors (i.e., increased intervention efficacy, compliance, and community coverage). We considered change in intervention effectiveness in the counterfactual scenarios for each intervention alone and in combination (WSH). We determined what combinations would be needed to achieve 50% reduction in child diarrhea compared to the control arm. Results: We found that high diarrheal prevalence in the WASH‐B Kenya trial was likely the primary reason for ineffectiveness. While none of the tested counterfactual factors greatly impacted intervention effectiveness in isolation, we estimated that 50% reduction in child diarrhea in the combined WSH treatment arm could be achieved through a combination of substantial intervention improvements (i.e., 50% intervention efficacy, 100% compliance, and 60% community coverage), but could not be attained for the single intervention arms. With improvements to contextual factors (consistent, 7.5% diarrheal prevalence, 50% increase in completeness) coupled with more modest increases in intervention factors (i.e., 50% efficacy and 100% compliance but only 20% community coverage), could achieve a 50% reduction in diarrhea in the combined WSH arm. Conclusions: In settings with high enteric pathogen prevalence, WASH interventions must be used by a substantial fraction the population and block all main transmission routes to achieve substantial reductions in diarrheal disease burden, including those over age 2. The WASH interventions and targeting strategy for the WASH‐B Kenya trial were unlikely to appreciably reduce diarrheal disease because of the high burden. In settings with more modest transmission, there are intervention factor targets that could result in measurable reductions in diarrhea. Application of this simulation‐based approach could inform WASH policies and programs, as well as the design of future trials."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prospective single‐center study in R.M. Gorbacheva institute included 27 patients with GI GVHD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. 19 patients received FMT, 8 patients received placebo. Clinical scales for GI autoimmune diseases were used to evaluate response. Microbiome alterations were assessed with multiplex PCR. RESULTS: After FMT higher overall bacterial mass (р=0.00088), higher bacterial numbers ofBifidobacteriumspp. (р=0.021),Escherichia coli(р=0.049) andBacteroides fragilisgr. (р=0.000043) compared to placebo group. Also higher bacterial mass was observed in patients with clinical response (р=0.0057). The bacterial mass after procedure in non‐responders was compared to the placebo group (р=0.31). Partial response of GVHD was achieved faster in the FMT group compared to placebo (median 4 days vs 48 days,p=0.014). Complete response was observed in 8 (42%), 14 (74%) and 16 (84%) at 30, 60 and 90 days respectively, while in the placebo group only 0%, 1 (13%) and 4 (50%) achieved complete response at the same time points. The incidence and severity of adverse events was comparable between FMT and the placebo group. CONCLUSION: FMT in patients with refractory GI GVHD was associated with favorable clinical outcomes and recovery in certain marker bacterial populations. Multiplex PCR can be used to assess an engraftment of a donor microbiota. FMT in GI GVHD was not associated with life‐threatening adverse events, but further studies are required to validate clinical efficacy."
"Identification and categorisation of relevant outcomes for symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease: in-depth analysis to inform the development of a core outcome set","Cruickshank, M; Newlands, R; Blazeby, J; Ahmed, I; Bekheit, M; Brazzelli, M; Croal, B; Innes, K; Ramsay, C; Gillies, K","BMJ open","10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045568","11","6","2021","BACKGROUND: Many completed trials of interventions for uncomplicated gallstone disease are not as helpful as they could be due to lack of standardisation across studies, outcome definition, collection and reporting. This heterogeneity of outcomes across studies hampers useful synthesis of primary studies and ultimately negatively impacts on decision making by all stakeholders. Core outcome sets offer a potential solution to this problem of heterogeneity and concerns over whether the 'right' outcomes are being measured. One of the first steps in core outcome set generation is to identify the range of outcomes reported (in the literature or by patients directly) that are considered important. OBJECTIVES: To develop a systematic map that examines the variation in outcome reporting of interventions for uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease, and to identify other outcomes of importance to patients with gallstones not previously measured or reported in interventional studies. RESULTS: The literature search identified 794 potentially relevant titles and abstracts of which 137 were deemed eligible for inclusion. A total of 129 randomised controlled trials, 4 gallstone disease specific patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs) and 8 qualitative studies were included. This was supplemented with data from 6 individual interviews, 1 focus group (n=5 participants) and analysis of 20 consultations. A total of 386 individual recorded outcomes were identified across the combined evidence: 330 outcomes (which were reported 1147 times) from trials evaluating interventions, 22 outcomes from PROMs, 17 outcomes from existing qualitative studies and 17 outcomes from primary qualitative research. Areas of overlap between the evidence sources existed but also the primary research contributed new, unreported in this context, outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study took a rigorous approach to catalogue and map the outcomes of importance in gallstone disease to enhance the development of the COS 'long' list. A COS for uncomplicated gallstone disease that considers the views of all relevant stakeholders is needed."

"A short, animated video to improve good COVID-19 hygiene practices: a structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Vandormael, A; Adam, M; Greuel, M; Bärnighausen, T","Trials","10.1186/s13063-020-04449-1","21","1","2020","OBJECTIVES: Entertainment‐education (E‐E) media can improve behavioral intent toward health‐related practices. In the era of COVID‐19, millions of people can be reached by E‐E media without requiring any physical contact. We have designed a short, wordless, animated video about COVID‐19 hygiene practices‐such as social distancing and frequent hand washing‐that can be rapidly distributed through social media channels to a global audience. The E‐E video's effectiveness, however, remains unclear. The study aims to achieve the following objectives. To: 1.Quantify people's interest in watching a short, animated video about COVID‐19 hygiene (abbreviated to CoVideo).2.Establish the CoVideo's effectiveness in increasing behavioural intent toward COVID‐19 hygiene.3.Establish the CoVideo's effectiveness in improving COVID‐19 hygiene knowledge. TRIAL DESIGN: The present study is a multi‐site, parallel group, randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effectiveness of the CoVideo against an attention placebo control (APC) video or no video. The trial has an intervention arm (CoVideo), placebo arm (APC), and control arm (no video). Nested in each trial arm is a list experiment and questionnaire survey, with the following ordering. Arm 1: the CoVideo, list experiment, and questionnaire survey. Arm 2: the APC video, list experiment, questionnaire survey, and CoVideo. Arm 3: the list experiment, questionnaire survey, and CoVideo. For each list experiment, participants will be randomized to a control or treatment group. The control group will receive a list of five items and the treatment group will receive the same five items plus one item about COVID‐19 hygiene. We will use the list experiment to reduce response bias associated with socially desirable answers to COVID‐19 questions. The questionnaire survey will include items about the participant's age, sex, country of residence, highest education, and knowledge of COVID‐19 spread. After completing the list experiment and questionnaire survey, participants in Arms 2 and 3 will receive the CoVideo to ensure post‐trial access to treatment. PARTICIPANTS: This will be an online study setting. We will use Prolific Academic (ProA: https://www.prolific.co) to recruit participants and host our study on the Gorilla™ platform (www.gorilla.sc). To be eligible, participants must be between the age of 18 and 59 years (male, female, or other) and have current residence in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Mexico, or France. Participants will be excluded from the study if they cannot speak English, German, French, or Spanish (since the instructions and survey questions will be available in these 4 languages only). MAIN OUTCOMES: This study will measure primary and secondary outcomes related to COVID‐19 hygiene. By hygiene, we mean the adoption of behaviors or practices that reduce the chances of being infected or spreading COVID‐19. As our primary outcome, we will measure changes in behavioral intent toward five hygiene practices: social distancing, washing hands, cleaning household surfaces, not sharing eating utensils, and not stockpiling essential goods. As a secondary outcome, we will measure knowledge about behaviors that can prevent the spread of COVID‐19. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED: The Gorilla algorithm will randomize 6,700 participants to each trial arm, giving a total sample size of 20,100. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The intervention is an E‐E video about COVID‐19 hygiene (CoVideo). Developed by our co‐author (MA) for Stanford Medicine, the CoVideo is animated with sound effects, and has no words, speech, or text. The CoVideo shows how the novel coronavirus is spread (airborne, physical contact) and summarizes the public's response to the COVID‐19 outbreak. Key components of the CoVideo are the promotion of five hygiene practices: i) social distancing and avoiding group gatherings, ii) frequently washing hands with soap and water or sanitizer, iii) cleaning surfaces at home (e.g., kitchen counters), iv) not sharing eating utensils, and v) avoidance of stockpiling essential goods (such as toilet paper and face masks). The CoVideo, which was designed for universal reach and optimized for release on social media channels, can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAj38E7vrS8. The comparators are an APC video (Arm 2) or no video (Arm 3). The APC video is similar in style to the CoVideo; it is also animated with a duration of 2.30 minutes, has sound effects but no words, speech, or text. The video message is about how small choices become actions, which become habits, which become a way of life. It is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HEnohs6yYw. Each list experiment will have a control list as the comparator. The control list is needed to measure the prevalence of behavioral intent toward COVID‐19 hygiene. RANDOMIZATION: Using a web‐based randomization algorithm, Gorilla will randomly allocate participants to the intervention (CoVideo), placebo (APC), or control (no video) arm (sequence generation) at a 1:1:1 ratio. Within each trial arm, Gorilla will randomly allocate participants at a 1:1 ratio to the control or treatment group. Items in the lists will be randomly ordered to avoid order effects. The presentation order of the list experiments will also be randomized. BLINDING: Because ProA handles the interaction between the study investigators and participants, the participants will be completely anonymous to the study investigators. The outcome measures will be self‐reported and submitted anonymously. All persons in the study team will be blinded to the group allocation. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol version number is 1.0 and the date is 18 May 2020. Recruitment is expected to end by 22 June 2020. Thus far, the study investigators have recruited 2,500 participants on ProA. Of these participants, 800 have completed the study on the Gorilla platform. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study and its outcomes were registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (www.drks.de) on May 12th, 2020, protocol number: #DRKS00021582. The study was registered before any data was collected. FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1). In the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol."

METHODS: We conducted a causal mediation analysis using data from the WASH Benefits Bangladesh cluster‐randomized trial (NCT01590095). Among a subsample of children within the WSH, nutrition, nutrition+WSH, and controls arms (N=1,409), we recorded caregiver‐reported antibiotic use at ages 14 and 28 months and collected stool at age 14 months. Mediators included caregiver‐reported child diarrhea, acute respiratory infection (ARI), and fever; and enteric pathogen carriage in stool measured by qPCR. Models controlled for mediator‐outcome confounders. FINDINGS: The receipt of any WSH or nutrition intervention reduced antibiotic use in the past month by 5.5 percentage points (95% CI 1.2, 9.9) through all pathways, from 49.5% (95% CI 45.9%, 53.0%) in the control group to 45.0 % (95% CI 42.7%, 47.2%) in the pooled intervention group. Interventions reduced antibiotic use by 0.6 percentage points (95% CI 0.1, 1.3) through reduced diarrhea, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI 0.1, 1.5) through reduced ARI with fever, and 1.8 percentage points (95% CI 0.5, 3.5) through reduced prevalence of enteric viruses. Interventions reduced antibiotic use through any mediator by 2.5 percentage points (95% CI 0.2, 5.3). INTERPRETATION: Our findings bolster a causal interpretation that WASH and nutrition interventions reduced pediatric antibiotic use through reduced infections in a rural, low‐income population.

Black men and women have among the highest CRC incidence and mortality rates of any racial/ethnic group. This study will examine the impact of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on gut microbiota and fecal metabolites associated with CRC risk. METHODS: A generally healthy sample of non‐Hispanic Black and white adults (n = 112) is being recruited to participate in a parallel‐arm randomized controlled feeding study. Participants are randomized to receive the DASH diet or a standard American diet for a 28‐day period. Fecal samples are collected weekly throughout the study to analyze changes in the gut microbiota using 16 s rRNA and selected metagenomics. Differences in bacterial alpha and beta diversity and taxa that have been associated with CRC (Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, Porphyromonas, Succinivibrio) are being evaluated. Covariate measures include body mass index, comorbidities, medication history, physical activity, stress, and demographic characteristics. CONCLUSION: Our findings will provide preliminary evidence for the DASH diet as an approach for cultivating a healthier gut microbiota across non‐Hispanic Black and non‐Hispanic White adults. These results can impact clinical, translational, and population‐level approaches for modification of the gut microbiota to reduce risk of chronic diseases including CRC.

Materials and methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in 80 patients who required outpatient gynecological procedures (hysterosalpingography, office hysteroscopy). There were 2 randomized groups: a study group who before the manipulation received a 6‐day cycle of sanitizing therapy with a multicomponent local agent; a comparison group had no therapy. The formed groups were matched by age, parity, anamnestic data, and gynecological history. The Femoflor‐16 PCR‐RT assay was used to assess the microbiocenosis of the vagina and uterine cavity. Results: The total vaginal bacterial mass in the patients of both groups was lg 6.3 and 6.2 GE/sample (p=0.94). After the sanitizing therapy, the study group showed a decrease in the total vaginal bacterial contamination to lg 4.8 (Q1–Q3: 4.4–5.05) (p=0.03). The total uterine bacterial mass was lg 2.3 GE/sample (Me, IQR 2.05– 2.95) and lg 4.8 GE/sample (Me, IQR 4.25–5.2) in the study and comparison groups, respectively (p<0.001). Comparing the indicators of uterine bacterial contamination with those of vaginal biocenosis after sanitation revealed a decline in the number of Peptostreptococcus spp., Veilonella spp. and Mobiluncus spp. in 17.5% of patients (p=0.018), Staphylococcus spp. (p=0.043) and Atopobium vaginae in 12.5% (p=0.042), Streptococcus spp. in 20% (p=0.012), Gardnerella vaginalis in 27.5% (p=0.003), and members of the Enterobacteriaceae family in 35.5% (p=0.01). Uterine cavity biocenosis could be characterized as lactobacillus‐dominant in 98% of patients in the study group; the dominant lactobacillus type of biocenosis was detected in 42.5% of those in the comparison group. Before and after the therapy, the correlation between the total vaginal bacterial mass was statistically significant (p=0.03; rxy =0.63) (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient) and had a noticeable tightness in accordance with the Chaddock scale. There were statistically significant direct correlations between the total vaginal bacterial mass after the therapy and the amount of Lactobacillus spp. (rxy =0.514; p=0.02) and Gardnerella vaginalis (rxy =0.55; p=0.01) in the uterine cavity. Conclusion: Preoperative sanitizing therapy can reduce the overall bacterial contamination of the vagina and uterine cavity by 2 times."

Methods: Twenty‐three patients undergo ESS and are randomly selected in each nostril either THP or SP packing. Symptoms including pain and nasal obstruction were evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) score by the patient and surgeon during weekly nasal toilette for 4 weeks. Post‐operative endoscopic evaluation on hemostasis score, infection and mucosal changes including recurrent polyps and adhesion done by 2 independent surgeons weekly via video endoscopic recording. Bacteria swab culture and sensitivity were taken 1 week postoperatively and mucosal biopsy from the designated middle meatus area was taken preoperatively and at 3rd‐week post surgery. Results: Patients VAS score showed a significant reduction in the symptoms of pain and nasal obstruction in the THP nasal cavity compared to the SP nostril. The surgeon also found that it is easier to perform nasal toilette in the THP nostril compared to SP. Endoscopic examination by 2 independent surgeons revealed a significant reduction in inflammation and bleeding in THP compared to SP in weekly follow‐ups. Interestingly, there was evidence of recurrent polyps in SP nasal mucosa and none in THP mucosa. Swab culture and sensitivity of the nasal mucosa showed significantly lower bacterial growth in THP. Histologically, pre‐ and post‐operative biopsy of the middle turbinate shows no significant difference in both groups. Conclusion: Tualang honey has the advantage of reducing the symptoms of pain and obstruction in the patient, easing the nasal toilette post‐ ESS and providing better wound healing, with less inflammation and lower bacterial growth, thus reducing recurrent polyps' formation."

The burden of child diarrhea in Bangladesh is still significant. Safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) can limit the events. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of WASH education of mothers or caregivers on child diarrhea. A community‐based randomized control trial was conducted in the selected households of a rural community in Dumki Upazila, Patuakhali from March–June 2019. A total of 202 mothers/caregivers received intervention and 202 did not receive intervention. A pre‐structured questionnaire was used to gather information on household WASH activities and diarrheal cases. Baseline data were collected first from the intervention group before providing education. WASH messages were given to the intervention group by face‐to‐face discussion. Both groups were followed up for diarrheal episodes for 3 months. Diarrheal prevalence of intervening group is compared with that of baseline and control. The results revealed that diarrheal prevalence was 11.4% (95% CI: 7.4–16.59%), 4.0% (95% CI: 1.7–7.65%), and 14.9% (95% CI: 10.25–20.52%) in baseline, intervention, and control group, respectively. Also, diarrhea was found lower in the intervention group than baseline (Z = − 2.524; P value = 0.012) and control (Z = − 1.85; P value = 0.04). WASH interventions were found effective to reduce the diarrheal episodes among under five children in rural community.

We conducted a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled crossover trial (NCT03582306) in individuals with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 and high habitual red meat intake and low habitual green leafy vegetable (GLV) intake. METHODS: Participants were provided with frozen GLV during the first or last four weeks (immediate or delayed intervention) of the twelve‐week trial. Biological and anthropometric measures were taken at the beginning and at each four‐week interval. A subset of 20 participants was selected for this secondary analysis of the intestinal permeability and inflammation‐related biomarkers: serum and fecal zonulin; serum lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), Alpha‐1‐acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM‐1), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), and C‐reactive protein; 8‐hydroxy‐2'‐deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) and plasma Vitamin K1 as a marker of protocol adherence. Nutrient and food group intake from two‐24‐h dietary recalls collected at each time point were assessed. Fecal microbiota was measured by 16 s rRNA PCR sequencing. Changes in biological markers, dietary factors, and microbial taxa were assessed with Wilcoxon Sign Ranks Tests. Exploratory analyses of the relationship between changes in outcome variables were conducted with Spearman correlations. RESULTS: No changes in serum and fecal zonulin and serum LBP were observed. Plasma Vitamin K (p = 0.005) increased, while plasma 8OHdG (p = 0.023) decreased during the intervention compared to the control. The only dietary factors that changed significantly were increases during intervention in Vitamin K and Dark GLV (p < 0.001 for both) compared to control. Fecal microbiota did not change significantly across all times points; however, change in serum zonulin was associated with change in Proteobacteria (ρ = ‐ 0.867, p = 0.001) in females and Bifidobacterium (ρ = ‐ 0.838, p = 0.009) and Bacteroidaceae (ρ = 0.871, p = 0.005) in men. CONCLUSIONS: A high GLV dietary intervention increased serum zonulin levels and had no effect on fecal zonulin. Lack of concordance between several inflammation‐associated biomarkers and zonulin corroborate recent reports of limited utility of zonulin in obese adults free of lower gastrointestinal disease.

Design: A double‐blind, randomised controlled 4‐week study involving 58 postmenopausal women was used to assess the chronic effects of milk PL consumption (0, 3 or 5 g‐PL/day) on lipid metabolism and gut microbiota. The acute effects of milk PL on intestinal absorption and metabolism of cholesterol were assessed in a randomised controlled crossover study using tracers in ileostomy patients. Results: Over 4 weeks, milk PL significantly reduced fasting and postprandial plasma concentrations of cholesterol and surrogate lipid markers of cardiovascular disease risk, including total/high‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol and apolipoprotein (Apo)B/ApoA1 ratios. The highest PL dose preferentially induced a decreased number of intestine‐derived chylomicron particles. Also, milk PL increased faecal loss of coprostanol, a gut‐derived metabolite of cholesterol, but major bacterial populations and faecal short‐chain fatty acids were not affected by milk PL, regardless of the dose. Acute ingestion of milk PL by ileostomy patients shows that milk PL decreased cholesterol absorption and increased cholesterol‐ileal efflux, which can be explained by the observed co‐excretion with milk sphingomyelin in the gut. Conclusion: The present data demonstrate for the first time in humans that milk PL can improve the cardiometabolic health by decreasing several lipid cardiovascular markers, notably through a reduced intestinal cholesterol absorption involving specific interactions in the gut, without disturbing the major bacterial phyla of gut microbiota.

"pH-responsive calcium and phosphate-ion releasing antibacterial sealants on carious enamel lesions in vitro","Ibrahim, MS; Balhaddad, AA; Garcia, IM; Collares, FM; Weir, MD; Xu, HHK; Melo, MAS","Journal of dentistry","10.1016/j.jdent.2020.103323","97",NA,"2020","OBJECTIVE: Nanoparticles of amorphous calcium phosphate (NACP) have shown beneficial effects of a robust release of calcium and phosphate ions at low pH. Here we examined the effect of NACP combined into antibacterial/rechargeable sealant formulations on the mineral content of artificial carious enamel during pH‐cycling mimicking intraoral conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NACP and a quaternary ammonium methacrylate (DMAHDM) were synthesized. Three resin sealants were formulated: ""base formulation"" (without NACP and DMAHDM, used as control); ""NACP on the base formulation"" (with 20 wt.% NACP); ""NACP on the antibacterial formulation"" (with 20 wt.% NACP and 5 wt.% DMAHDM). Standardized enamel windows on sealed non‐carious human molars were demineralized and randomly divided into four groups: three groups of teeth sealed with the experimental materials and one group of teeth without sealant application used as negative control. The teeth were exposed to pH cycling regime. The changes in the mineral content of enamel were assessed by quantitative surface hardness loss in percentage (%SHL) and qualitative analyses via scanning electron microscopy/energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (SEM‐EDX) and polarized light microscopy (PLM). RESULTS: The contact with NACP‐containing formulations provoked significant lower %SHL on sealed enamel (p < 0.05) in comparison to control groups. This outcome was supported by the results of SEM‐EDX, in which the enamel presented higher percentages of calcium and phosphate than control groups. PLM showed less enamel superficial demineralization around the sealants containing NACP. CONCLUSION: NACP incorporated into an antibacterial sealant protected the enamel against demineralization. pH‐responsive calcium and phosphate‐ion releasing sealants with antimicrobial and rechargeable properties may be a reliable complementary approach for caries management. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Dental caries is the most common childhood disease. Enamel demineralization represents the initial stage of carious lesion formation and may lead to invasive dental procedures. We explored the role of amorphous calcium phosphate (NACP) in a newly‐developed antibacterial and rechargeable dental sealant formulation as a preventive approach."
"Metabolic plasticity of the gut microbiome in response to diets differing in glycemic load in a randomized, crossover, controlled feeding study","Hullar, MA; Kahsai, O; Curtis, KR; Navarro, SL; Zhang, Y; Randolph, TW; Levy, L; Shojaie, A; Kratz, M; Neuhouser, ML; Lampe, PD; Raftery, D; Lampe, JW","American journal of clinical nutrition","10.1016/j.ajcnut.2025.06.026","122","3","2025","BACKGROUND: Dietary patterns characterized by low glycemic, minimally processed plant foods are associated with lower risk of several chronic diseases. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the effects of a low glycemic load (LGL) compared with a high glycemic load (HGL) dietary pattern on stool bacterial community structure and metabolism. METHODS: Participants in this crossover‐controlled feeding study were healthy men and women (n = 69). We identified genera, species, and genes and transcripts of metabolic pathways and bacterial enzymes using 16S rRNA gene, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis. RESULTS: Overall community structure measured by alpha and beta diversity was not significantly different across the diets, although diet did significantly increase the abundance of 13 of 161 genera (Padj < 0.05) and 5 species in the LGL diet and 7 species in the HGL diet. Gene expression in the hexitol fermentation pathway (β = ‐1.15; SE = 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI]: ‐1.63, ‐0.67; Padj = 0.002) was significantly higher in the HGL diet, whereas expression in the L‐lysine biosynthesis pathway (β = 0.20; SE = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.30; Padj = 0.03) was enriched in the LGL diet. The beta diversity of expressed carbohydrate‐active enzymes (CAZymes) was significantly different between the diets (MiRKAT, P < 0.001). CAZymes enriched in the HGL diet reflected dietary additives, whereas CAZymes enriched in the LGL diet reflected diverse phytochemical intake. There was a significant interaction between homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR) and the coenzyme A biosynthesis I pathway involved in bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis (Padj = 0.035), which was positive in the HGL diet (b = 0.20; SE = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.39) and negative in the LGL diet (β = ‐0.23; SE = 0.09; 95% CI: ‐0.40, ‐0.06). CONCLUSIONS: In healthy humans, diet impacts microbial metabolism and enzymatic activity but not the overall diversity of the gut microbiome. This emphasizes the relevance of dietary components in activating expression of specific bacterial genes and their impact on host metabolism. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00622661."
"The excretion rate and stability of HAAg in human fecal samples after live attenuated hepatitis A vaccination","Wang, X; Pan, Y; Chen, J; Luo, J; Xi, J; Ye, C; Zhao, Y; Qiu, L; Weng, S; Hong, S; Lin, Y; Sun, Q","Journal of medical virology","10.1002/jmv.25747","92","12","2020","The live attenuated hepatitis A virus vaccine (HA‐L) is in routine use in the Chinese national immunization program (NIP). The major disadvantages of HA‐L include that theoretically, it may be possible for mutation shifts and secondary infections of the live vaccine viral strain. The aim of this study was to explore variation in the viral strain after vaccination with the HA‐L. A total of 1297 fecal samples (including 470 for the 18 to 36‐month‐old age group, 527 for the 3 to 16‐year‐old group, and 300 for the 16 years and older group) were collected in the study, and the rate of hepatitis A virus (HAV) positivity in fecal samples was 11.36% (31/273), 11.44% (31/271), 9.70% (26/268), 8.47% (21/248), and 9.70% (23/237) on days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28, respectively. A total of 77 HAV positive samples were randomly selected for VP1/2A (360 bp, 2218‐2577) gene analysis. Phylogenetic trees were then constructed by the neighbor‐joining method. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all the isolated HAV strains belonged to sub‐genotype IB, which was the same as the vaccine strain. Compared with the vaccine strain, HM‐175/7MK‐5 (M16632.1), there were only two base mutations discovered, at 2291 and 2568. However, the amino acid mutation analysis showed that those base mutations were synonymous mutations. The isolated HAV strains were genetically stable. This study provides a reference for the safety concern regarding the routine and wide‐range use in people older than 18 months."
"Moderate to severe diarrhea and associated factors among under-five children in Wonago district, South Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study","Tesfaye, TS; Magarsa, AU; Zeleke, TM","Pediatric health, medicine and therapeutics","10.2147/PHMT.S266828","11",NA,"2020","Background: Diarrheal disease is the second leading cause of death in children under five years old and is responsible for killing around 525 000 children every year. Based on the world health organization estimates, diarrhea contributes to more than one in every ten (13%) child deaths in Ethiopia. Despite the emphasis given to improving child health, many children are still dying due to easily preventable and treatable diarrheal disease in Ethiopia. Methods: A community cross‐sectional study was conducted on randomly selected under‐five children who live in Wonago district. Three hundred eighteen households were selected using a systematic sampling technique. Data were collected using a structured closed‐ended questionnaire. Data were cleaned, coded, and entered into the statistical package for social sciences window version 20 statistical software analysis. Results: The magnitude of moderate to severe diarrhea in the Wonago district was 30.9%. The number of family members (AOR: 2.7, 95% CI [1.277–5.716]), presence of animals in households (AOR: 2.591, 95% CI [1.188–5.650]), availability of latrine (AOR: 2.129, 95% CI [1.006–4.505]), and hand washing practice during a critical time (AOR: 2.683, 95% CI [1.139–6.319]) were strongly associated with moderate to severe diarrhea. Conclusion: Childhood diarrhea remains an important health concern in the study area. This calls for a holistic and multimodal approach for the prevention, early identification, and intervention of diarrhea in children. More emphasis should also be given on personal, household, and environmental hygiene, as well as family planning."
"Strain-level analysis of gut-resident pro-inflammatory viridans group Streptococci suppressed by long-term cotrimoxazole prophylaxis among HIV-positive children in Zimbabwe","Gough, EK; Bourke, CD; Berejena, C; Shonhai, A; Bwakura-Dangarembizi, M; Prendergast, AJ; Manges, AR","Gut microbes","10.1080/19490976.2020.1717299","11","4","2020","Antimicrobials have become a mainstay of healthcare in the past century due to their activity against pathogens. More recently, it has become clear that they can also affect health via their impact on the microbiota and inflammation. This may explain some of their clinical benefits despite global increases in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and reduced antimicrobial effectiveness. We showed in a randomized controlled trial of stopping versus continuing cotrimoxazole prophylaxis among HIV‐positive Zimbabwean children taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), that continuation of cotrimoxazole persistently suppressed gut‐resident viridans group streptococcal species (VGS) that were associated with intestinal inflammation. In this addendum, we provide a broader overview of how antibiotics can shape the microbiota and use high read‐depth whole metagenome sequencing data from our published study to investigate whether (i) the impact of cotrimoxazole on gut VGS and (ii) VGS associated inflammation, is attributable to strain‐level variability. We focus on S. salivarius, the VGS species that was most prevalent in the cohort and for which there was sufficient genome coverage to differentiate strains. We demonstrate that suppression of S. salivarius by cotrimoxazole is not strain specific, nor did stool concentration of the pro‐inflammatory mediator myeloperoxidase vary by S. salivarius strain. We also show that gut‐resident S. salivarius strains present in this study population are distinct from common oral strains. This is the first analysis of how cotrimoxazole prophylaxis used according to international treatment guidelines for children living with HIV influences the gut microbiome at the strain‐level. We also provide a detailed review of the literature on the mechanisms by which suppression of VGS may act synergistically with cotrimoxazole's anti‐inflammatory effects to reduce gut inflammation. A greater understanding of the sub‐clinical effects of antibiotics offers new insights into their responsible clinical use."
"Changes in Microbiota Profiles After Prolonged Frozen Storage of Stool Suspensions","Dorsaz, S; Charretier, Y; Girard, M; Gaia, N; Leo, S; Schrenzel, J; Harbarth, S; Huttner, B; Lazarevic, V","Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology","10.3389/fcimb.2020.00077","10",NA,"2020","Introduction: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is recommended as safe and effective treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections. Freezing the FMT preparation simplifies the process, allowing a single stool sample to be used for multiple receivers and over an extended period of time. We aimed to assess the effect of long‐term frozen storage on bacterial taxonomic profiles of a stool suspension prepared for FMT. Methods: DNA was extracted from a stool suspension before freezing and sequentially during the 18‐month storage period at ‐80°C. Two different protocols were used for DNA extraction. The first relied on a classical mechanical and chemical cell disruption to extract both intra‐ and extracellular DNA; the second included specific pre‐treatments aimed at removing free DNA and DNA from human and damaged bacterial cells. Taxonomic profiling of bacterial communities was performed by sequencing of V3‐V4 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Results: Microbiota profiles obtained by whole DNA extraction procedure remained relatively stable during frozen storage. When DNA extraction procedure included specific pre‐treatments, microbiota similarity between fresh and frozen samples progressively decreased with longer frozen storage times; notably, the abundance of Bacteroidetes decreased in a storage duration‐dependent manner. The abundance of Firmicutes, the main butyrate producers in the colon, were not much affected by frozen storage for up to 1 year. Conclusion: Our data show that metataxonomic analysis of frozen stool suspensions subjected to specific pre‐treatments prior to DNA extractions might provide an interesting indication of bacterial resistance to stress conditions and thus of chances of survival in FMT recipients."

Blood and stool samples were collected at several time points and evaluated for polio‐neutralizing antibodies and serotype‐specific poliovirus, respectively. Eighty‐one of 589 (14%) children excreted PV1 7 days post‐OPV challenge; 70 of 81 (86%) were seropositive at baseline. Twelve of 610 (2%) were asymptomatic wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) excretors. Most poliovirus excretors had humoral immunity, suggesting mucosal immunity in these children likely waned or never developed. Without mucosal immunity, they are susceptible to poliovirus infection, shedding, and transmission. Asymptomatic WPV1 excretion suggests undetected poliovirus circulation within the community."

"Improvement of skin condition and intestinal microbiota via Heyndrickxia coagulans SANK70258 intake: a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparative study","Togawa, N; Yamada, R; Aoki, Y; Suehiro, S; Uchida, N; Haseda, A; Kagami-Katsuyama, H; Honma, N; Nishihira, J","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)","10.1016/j.nut.2024.112533","126",NA,"2024","OBJECTIVE: Heyndrickxia coagulans SANK70258, a representative probiotic, is known for alleviating inflammation caused by cedar pollen, improving the intestinal environment and bowel movements. A previous study on consuming H. coagulans SANK70258 together with galactooligosaccharides showed a trend toward improvement in skin scaliness scores and subjective assessments of skin roughness. However, the effect of H. coagulans SANK70258 alone on the skin remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to re‐evaluate the effects of the intake of H. coagulans SANK70258 alone on skin conditions and the intestinal environment through a clinical trial. METHODS: This placebo‐controlled, double‐blind clinical trial involved 80 Japanese women aged 30 to 65 with perceived skin roughness. Participants were divided into placebo and test groups. Over eight weeks, the test group consumed H. coagulans SANK70258, and its effects on skin condition and intestinal health were examined. RESULTS: The probiotic group showed significant intestinal improvements, with reduced fecal phenol levels (p = 0.044) and pH (p = 0.022), as well as enhanced skin lightness (L* value) (p = 0.040) and liver function tests. Metabolic analyses revealed decreases in fecal Nε‐(carboxymethyl)lysine and plasma hydroxyproline, suggesting skin health benefits. There were also significant improvements in skin scaliness (p = 0.015) and bowel movement frequency (p = 0.032) in subgroup analysis. CONCLUSIONS: H. coagulans SANK70258 can improve skin health by improving the intestinal lining. This probiotic reduces the levels of intestinal putrefactive products and advanced glycation end‐product levels in feces, suggesting that it may affect not only skin health but also systemic tissues such as the liver."

METHODS: We performed a prospective, multi‐center study, conducted among patients who received a single dose of FMT from one of four healthy donors. The primary endpoint was complete clearance of CPE carriage two weeks after FMT with a secondary endpoint at three months. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to assess gut microbiota composition of donors and recipients before and after FMT. RESULTS: Twenty CPE‐colonized patients were included in the study, where post‐FMT 20% (n = 4/20) of patients met the primary endpoint and 40% (n = 8/20) of patients met the secondary endpoint. Kaplan‐Meier curves between patients with FMT intervention and the control group (n = 82) revealed a similar rate of decolonization between groups. Microbiota composition analyses revealed that response to FMT was not donor‐dependent. Responders had a significantly lower relative abundance of CPE species pre‐FMT than non‐responders, and 14 days post‐FMT responders had significantly higher bacterial species richness and alpha diversity compared to non‐responders (p < 0.05). Responder fecal samples were also enriched in specific species, with significantly higher relative abundances of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Parabacteroides distasonis, Collinsella aerofaciens, Alistipes finegoldii and Blautia_A sp900066335 (q<0.01) compared to non‐responders. CONCLUSION: FMT administration using the proposed regimen did not achieve statistical significance for complete CPE decolonization but was correlated with the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa, including CPE species."
"Gut mycobiome and its interaction with diet, gut bacteria and alzheimer's disease markers in subjects with mild cognitive impairment: a pilot study","Nagpal, R; Neth, BJ; Wang, S; Mishra, SP; Craft, S; Yadav, H","EBioMedicine","10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102950","59",NA,"2020","Background: Recently, we reported that patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) harbor specific signature of bacteria in their gut and that a modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) improves Alzheimer's disease (AD) markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the signatures of gut bacteria. However, other microbial population such as gut fungi (mycobiome) in relation to MCI/AD pathology, gut bacteria and diet remain unknown. Methods: We measure gut mycobiome by sequencing of the fungal rRNA ITS1 gene in 17 older adults (11 MCI; 6 cognitively normal [CN]) in a single‐center, randomized, double‐blind, crossover pilot study, before and after 6 weeks intervention of MMKD and American Heart Association Diet (AHAD), and determine its correlation with AD markers in CSF and gut bacteria. Findings: Compared to CN counterparts, patients with MCI have higher proportion of families Sclerotiniaceae, Phaffomyceteceae, Trichocomaceae, Cystofilobasidiaceae, Togniniaceae and genera Botrytis, Kazachstania, Phaeoacremonium and Cladosporium and lower abundance of Meyerozyma. Specific fungal taxa exhibit distinct correlation arrays with AD markers and gut bacteria in subjects with versus without MCI. MMKD induces broader effect on fungal diversity in subjects with MCI and increases Agaricus and Mrakia while decreasing Saccharomyces and Claviceps with differential response in subjects with or without MCI. Interpretation: The study reveals MCI‐specific mycobiome signatures and demonstrates that distinct diets modulate the mycobiome in association with AD markers and fungal‐bacterial co‐regulation networks in patients with MCI. The findings corroborate the notion of considering gut mycobiome as a unique factor that can affect cognitive health/AD by interacting with gut bacteria and diet and facilitate better understanding of the AD and related microbiome, using unique diet or microbiome modulators."

Dietary supplementation with soluble fiber is one of several proposed modulation strategies. This study aims at confirming the impact of the resistant dextrin NUTRIOSE (RD), a soluble fiber with demonstrated beneficial health effects, on the gut microbiota of healthy individuals. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty healthy women are enrolled and supplemented daily with either RD (n = 24) or a control product (n = 26) during 6 weeks. Characterization of the fecal metagenome with shotgun sequencing reveals that RD intake dramatically increases the abundance of the commensal bacterium Parabacteroides distasonis. Furthermore, presence in metagenomes of accessory genes from P. distasonis, coding for susCD (a starch‐binding membrane protein complex) is associated with a greater increase of the species. This suggests that response to RD might be strain‐dependent. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with RD can be used to specifically increase P. distasonis in gut microbiota of healthy women. The magnitude of the response may be associated with fiber‐metabolizing capabilities of strains carried by subjects. Further research will seek to confirm that P. distasonis directly modulates the clinical effects observed in other studies."

Several studies suggest that gut microbiota may influence AD by immune system regulation. METHODS: We performed the first in‐human efficacy and safety assessment of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for AD adult patients. All patients received 2 placebo transplantations followed by 4 FMTs each 2 weeks apart. AD severity and fecal microbiome profile were evaluated by the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis Score (SCORAD), the weekly frequency of topical corticosteroids usage, and gut microbiota metagenomic analysis, at the study beginning, before every FMT, and 1‐8 months after the last FMT. RESULTS: Nine patients completed the study protocol. There was no significant change in the SCORAD score following the two placebo transplants. The average SCORAD score significantly decreased from baseline at Weeks 4‐12 (before and 2 weeks after 4 times of FMT) (59.2 ± 34.9%, Wilcoxon p = .011), 50% and 75% decrease was achieved by 7 (77%) and 4 (44%) patients, respectively. At Week 18 (8 weeks after the last FMT) the average SCORAD score decreased from baseline at Week 4 (85.5 ± 8.4%, Wilcoxon p = .018), 50% and 75% decrease was achieved by 7 (77%) and 6 (66.7%) patients respectively. Weekly topical corticosteroids usage was diminished during the study and follow‐up period as well. Two patients had a quick relapse and were switched to a different treatment. Two patients developed exacerbations alleviated after an additional fifth FMT. Metagenomic analysis of the fecal microbiota of patients and donors showed bacterial strains transmission from donors to patients. No adverse events were recorded during the study and follow‐up period. CONCLUSIONS: FMT may be a safe and effective therapeutic intervention for AD patients, associated with transfer of specific microbial species from the donors to the patients. Further studies are required to reconfirm these results."

RESULT: The probiotic group exhibited lower incidences of bloating (10.2% vs 19.4%, P=0.037), constipation (2.3% vs 7.8%, P =0.048), and excessive vaginal discharge (3.1% vs 9.3%, P=0.040), and showed better treatment tolerability compared to the placebo group (P<0.05), although no statistically significant difference in eradication rates between the two groups. High‐throughput sequencing revealed that H. pylori eradication therapy led to a decrease in the relative abundance of Prevotella in the gut microbiota, and an increase in Streptococcus and Haemophilus. In the vaginal microbiota, Lactobacillus decreased while Gardnerella increased. Compared to the placebo group, the probiotic group showed a higher relative abundance of Megamonas, Prevotella, and Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota, and lower levels of Streptococcus and Haemophilus. In the vaginal microbiota, Gardnerella was significantly lower (P<0.05). Correlation analysis revealed a positive association between gastrointestinal and vaginal adverse events, and a positive correlation of Lactobacillus in both gut and vaginal microbiota (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: This study clinically demonstrates for the first time that L. plantarum MH ‐ 301 may reduce H. pylori treatment ‐ related adverse events via gut ‐ vaginal axis. In addition, microbiota modulation may be the mechanism through which it exerts its clinical efficacy."
"One Week Prevalence and Incidence of Diarrhea: baseline Status of Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial of Nano Maji Filter System in Geita, Tanzania","Mashoto, KO; Omolo, JJ; Kazyoba, PE","The east african health research journal","10.24248/eahrj.v6i1.684","6","1","2022","BACKGROUND: We have developed Nano Maji (NMM) filter system for water treatment which is currently being evaluated in a definitive cluster randomised controlled trial. OBJECTIVES: This paper descriptively presents the baseline status of one‐week incidence and prevelence of diarrhoea water, sanitation and hygiene and their determinants. METHODS: Recruited households in the three villages of Geita district were allocated to either intervention (NNM filter system) or control (usual practice). The primary outcome of the trial is to reduce episodes of diarrhoea at 6 months post‐randomisation. Secondary outcomes are to improve water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) status. Although households were sampled, individuals living in the selected households are used as unit of analysis for estimation of prevalence and incidence of diarrhea. RESULTS: A total of 1,281 individuals (1,070 above 5 years and 211 under the age of 5 year children) lived in 186 households (7 individuals per household). The reported one‐week prevalence and incidence of diarrhea was 10.8% and 8.4% respectively. Children under the age of five years had high incidence (22.7%) of diarrhea than individuals aged 5 years and above (5.6%). Among under five children, boys had high incidence and prevalence of diarrhea than girls. Individuals with diarrhea were likely to live in poor household, not using safe water and toilet. Over 70% of households had unacceptable latrines 135 (72.7%) and poor water situation 138 (74.3%) in terms of practice of storing, treating and drawing water from storage container. Majority of respondents had limited knowledge on handwashing and rarely used soap when washing hands. CONCLUSION: Substantial proportion of individuals living in project areas are affected by diarrhea. Children below the age of five years are more affected than individuals aged five years and above. The baseline findings are representative of local status of WASH, and reflects the prevailing poor water, sanitation and hygiene status in rural areas of Tanzania.

Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) resulting from poor water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) may contribute. We therefore tested associations between EED and RVV immunogenicity, and evaluated the effect of improved WASH on EED. Methods: We measured nine biomarkers of EED among Zimbabwean infants born to mothers enrolled in a cluster‐randomised 2 × 2 factorial trial of improved WASH and improved feeding between November 2012 and March 2015 (NCT01824940). We used multivariable regression to determine associations between EED biomarkers and RVV seroconversion, seropositivity and geometric mean titer. Log‐binomial regression was used to evaluate the effect of improved WASH on EED. Findings: Among 303 infants with EED biomarkers and immunogenicity data, plasma intestinal fatty‐acid binding protein and stool myeloperoxidase were positively associated with RVV seroconversion; adjusted RR 1.63 (95%CI 1.04, 2.57) and 1.29 (95%CI 1.01, 1.65), respectively. There were no other associations between RVV immunogenicity and either individual biomarkers or EED domains (intestinal permeability, intestinal damage, intestinal inflammation and microbial translocation). EED biomarkers did not differ between randomised WASH and non‐WASH groups. Interpretation: We found no evidence that EED was associated with poor RVV immunogenicity. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was weak evidence that EED was associated with increased seroconversion. EED biomarkers were not affected by a package of household‐level WASH interventions."
"Fungal Trans-kingdom Dynamics Linked to Responsiveness to Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) Therapy in Ulcerative Colitis","Leonardi, I; Paramsothy, S; Doron, I; Semon, A; Kaakoush, NO; Clemente, JC; Faith, JJ; Borody, TJ; Mitchell, HM; Colombel, JF; Kamm, MA; Iliev, ID","Cell host & microbe","10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.006","27","5","2020","Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) targeting gut microbiota has recently been successfully applied to ulcerative colitis. However, only a subset of patients responds to FMT, and there is a pressing need for biomarkers of responsiveness. Fungi (the mycobiota) represent a highly immunologically reactive component of the gut microbiota. We analyzed samples from a large randomized controlled trial of FMT for ulcerative colitis (UC). High Candida abundance pre‐FMT was associated with a clinical response, whereas decreased Candida abundance post‐FMT was indicative of ameliorated disease severity. High pre‐FMT Candida was associated with increased bacterial diversity post‐FMT, and the presence of genera was linked to FMT responsiveness. Although we detected elevated anti‐Candida antibodies in placebo recipients, this increase was abrogated in FMT recipients. Our data suggest that FMT might reduce Candida to contain pro‐inflammatory immunity during intestinal disease and highlight the utility of mycobiota‐focused approaches to identify FMT responders prior to therapy initiation."
"Clinical results and microbiota changes after faecal microbiota transplantation for chronic pouchitis: a pilot study","Kousgaard, SJ; Michaelsen, TY; Nielsen, HL; Kirk, KF; Brandt, J; Albertsen, M; Thorlacius-Ussing, O","Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology","10.1080/00365521.2020.1748221","55","4","2020","Objectives: Research evidence suggests that chronic pouchitis is associated with intestinal dysbiosis. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been proposed as a possible treatment. We performed a 6‐month prospective, open‐label, single‐centre cohort pilot‐study (NCT03538366) to investigate if FMT could improve clinical outcome and alter gut microbiota in patients with chronic pouchitis. Materials and methods: Nine adult patients with chronic pouchitis were included and allocated to 14 days FMT by enemas from five faecal donors, with a 6‐month follow‐up. Pouchitis severity was assessed using pouchitis disease activity index (PDAI) before and after FMT. Changes in gut microbiota, and engraftment of donor’s microbiota were assessed in faecal samples. Results: All patients were treated with FMT for 14 continuous days. Overall, four of nine patients receiving FMT were in clinical remission at 30‐day follow‐up, and three patients remained in remission until 6‐month follow‐up. Clinical symptoms of pouchitis improved significantly between inclusion and 14‐day follow‐up (p =.02), but there was no improvement in PDAI between inclusion (mean 8.6) and 30‐day follow‐up (mean 5.2). Treatment with FMT caused a substantial shift in microbiota and increased microbial diversity in six patients, resembling that of the donors, with a high engraftment of specific donor microbiota. Conclusions: Symptomatic benefit in FMT treatment was found for four of nine patients with chronic pouchitis with increased microbial diversity and high engraftment of donor’s microbiota. A larger, randomised controlled study is required to fully evaluate the potential role of FMT in treating chronic pouchitis."
"Engraftment of strictly anaerobic oxygen-sensitive bacteria in irritable bowel syndrome patients following fecal microbiota transplantation does not improve symptoms","Browne, PD; Cold, F; Petersen, AM; Halkjær, SI; Christensen, AH; Günther, S; Hestbjerg Hansen, L","Gut microbes","10.1080/19490976.2021.1927635","13","1","2021","Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been correlated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is being explored as a therapeutic option. Little is known of the mechanisms of engraftment of microbes following FMT and whether the engraftment of certain microbes correlate with clinical improvement in IBS. Microbiome data, from a previously reported placebo‐controlled trial of treatment of IBS with FMT or placebo capsules, were used to investigate microbial engraftment 15 days, 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment through assessment of gains, losses and changes in abundance of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and microbial diversity (CHAO‐1 richness) between the FMT group and the placebo group. These data were compared to changes in IBS Symptom Severity Scores (IBS‐SSS). Twelve days of treatment with 25 daily multi‐donor FMT capsules induced significant short‐ and long‐term changes in the recipients’ microbiomes for at least 6 months, with persistent engraftment of a variety of anaerobic bacteria from keystone genera, such as Faecalibacterium, Prevotella and Bacteroides and increased microbial diversity, particularly in patients with low initial diversity. FMT recipients lost ASVs after treatment, which was seen to a much lesser extent in the placebo group. No ASVs increased to a greater extent between FMT responders and non‐responders following treatment. Major long‐term changes, lasting for at least 6 months, in the gut microbiomes of IBS patients are seen following treatment with FMT capsules. None of these changes correlated with clinical improvement. The relationship between the microbiome and the etiology of IBS still remains unsolved."
"Linking Human Milk Oligosaccharides, Infant Fecal Community Types, and Later Risk To Require Antibiotics","Berger, B; Porta, N; Foata, F; Grathwohl, D; Delley, M; Moine, D; Charpagne, A; Siegwald, L; Descombes, P; Alliet, P; Puccio, G; Steenhout, P; Mercenier, A; Sprenger, N","mBio","10.1128/mBio.03196-19","11","2","2020","Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) may provide health benefits to infants partly by shaping the development of the early‐life intestinal microbiota. In a randomized double‐blinded controlled multicentric clinical trial, healthy term infants received either infant formula (control) or the same formula with two HMOs (2'‐fucosyllactose and lacto‐N‐neotetraose; test) from enrollment (0 to 14 days) to 6 months. Then, all infants received the same follow‐up formula without HMOs until 12 months of age. Breastfed infants (BF) served as a reference group. Stool microbiota at 3 and 12 months, analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, clustered into seven fecal community types (FCTs) with marked differences in total microbial abundances. Three of the four 12‐month FCTs were likely precursors of the adult enterotypes. At 3 months, microbiota composition in the test group (n = 58) appeared closer to that of BF (n = 35) than control (n = 63) by microbiota alpha (within group) and beta (between groups) diversity analyses and distribution of FCTs. While bifidobacteriaceae dominated two FCTs, its abundance was significantly higher in one (FCT BiH for Bifidobacteriaceae at high abundance) than in the other (FCT Bi for Bifidobacteriaceae). HMO supplementation increased the number of infants with FCT BiH (predominant in BF) at the expense of FCT Bi (predominant in control). We explored the association of the FCTs with reported morbidities and medication use up to 12 months. Formula‐fed infants with FCT BiH at 3 months were significantly less likely to require antibiotics during the first year than those with FCT Bi. Previously reported lower rates of infection‐related medication use with HMOs may therefore be linked to gut microbiota community types. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT01715246.)IMPORTANCE Human milk is the sole and recommended nutrition for the newborn infant and contains one of the largest constituents of diverse oligosaccharides, dubbed human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). Preclinical and clinical association studies indicate that HMOs have multiple physiological functions largely mediated through the establishment of the gut microbiome. Until recently, HMOs were not available to investigate their role in randomized controlled intervention trials. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the effects of 2 HMOs on establishing microbiota in newborn infants. We provide a detailed description of the microbiota changes observed upon feeding a formula with 2 HMOs in comparison to breastfed reference infants' microbiota. Then, we associate the microbiota to long‐term health as assessed by prescribed antibiotic use."

Intestinal microbiota may help identify patients at risk, thus improving the strategies of secondary prevention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the baseline differences between the gut microbiota from coronary heart disease (CHD) patients suffering new major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in the following 7 years, compared with CHD patients who did not undergo new MACE in this period, and to build a score associated with the risk of suffering new MACE. METHODS: Within the framework of the CORDIOPREV study, a clinical trial that involved 1002 patients with CHD, intestinal microbiota was examined in patients with available faecal samples (n = 679, 132 MACE), through 16S metagenomics on the Illumina MiSeq and Quiime2 software. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was measured using limulus amoebocyte lysate test. RESULTS: Random survival forest identified 10 bacterial taxa with a higher predictive power for MACE incidence. Receiver operating characteristic curves yielded an area under the curve of 65.2% (59.1%‐71.3%) in the training set and 68.6% (59.3%‐77.9%) in the validation set. The intestinal microbiota risk score was associated with a MACE incidence hazard ratio of 2.01 (95% confidence interval 1.37‐3.22). Lipopolysaccharide analysis showed a greater LPS post‐prandial fold change in the MACE group (P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: These results reinforce the relationship between intestinal microbiota and CVD and suggest that a microbiota profile is associated with MACE in CHD patients, in addition to higher endotoxaemia."

OBJECTIVE: Explore characteristics of overweight and obese female early‐stage (0 to II) breast cancer patients with low AM relative abundance (LAM) vs high (HAM) enrolled in a presurgical weight‐loss trial. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of pooled participants in a randomized controlled trial (NCT02224807). PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: During the period from 2014 to 2017, 32 female patients with breast cancer were randomized to weight‐loss or attention‐control arms from time of diagnosis‐to‐lumpectomy (mean=30±9 days). INTERVENTION: All were instructed to correct nutrient deficiencies via food sources and on upper‐body exercises. The weight‐loss group received additional guidance to promote 0.5 to 1 kg/wk weight‐loss via energy restriction and aerobic exercise. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At baseline and follow‐up, sera, fecal samples, two‐24 hour dietary recalls and dual x‐ray absorptiometry were obtained. Bacterial DNA was isolated from feces and polymerase chain reaction (16S) amplified. Inflammatory cytokines were measured in sera. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Differences between LAM and HAM participants were analyzed using t tests and nonparametric tests. Spearman correlations explored relationships between continuous variables. RESULTS: Participants were aged 61±9 years with body mass index 34.8±6. Mean AM relative abundance was 0.02% (0.007% to 0.06%) and 1.59% (0.59% to 13.57%) for LAM and HAM participants, respectively. At baseline, women with HAM vs LAM had lower fat mass (38.9±11.2 kg vs 46.4±9.0 kg; P=0.044). Alpha diversity (ie, species richness) was higher in women with HAM (360.8±84.8 vs 282.4±69.6; P=0.008) at baseline, but attenuated after weight‐loss (P=0.058). At baseline, interleukin‐6 level was associated with species richness (ρ=‐0.471, P=0.008) and fat mass (ρ=0.529, P=0.002), but not AM. Change in total dietary fiber was positively associated with AM in LAM (ρ=0.626, P=0.002), but not HAM (ρ=0.436, P=0.180) participants. CONCLUSIONS: Among women with early‐stage breast cancer, body composition is associated with AM, microbiota diversity, and interleukin‐6 level. AM may mediate the effects of dietary fiber in improving microbiota composition."

The prevalence of infection with H. pylori infection varies worldwide. Pharmacologic therapy for eradication must be initiated in symptomatic individuals with emphasis on hygiene and sanitation. The high prevalence of H. pylori infection in the country, and the lack of adequate evidence on the efficacy of the standard triple therapy in Southern India was the drive to conduct this study. Aim: To compare and evaluate the efficacy of 14 days clarithromycin based triple drug therapy over 10 days levofloxacin based triple drug therapy in H. pylori eradication. Materials and Methods: A randomised clinical study was conducted from September 2018 to February 2019, at a tertiary care teaching hospital and research centre in suburban Chennai, Southern India. Eighty patients with dyspepsia, who were diagnosed with H. pylori infection based on both Rapid Urease Test (RUT) and histopathology of antral biopsy, were alternately assigned to treatment with either 14 days clarithromycin based triple drug regimen (PAC) or 10 days levofloxacin based triple drug regimen (PAL). Efficacy of the drugs were compared using both RUT and histopathology of endoscopic antral biopsy specimen four weeks after completion of the treatment. Chi‐square test was used for data analysis. Results: Out of the 80 enrolled patients, 70 individuals completed the study, of which 41 were males and 29 were females. Baseline characteristics were similar in the both the groups‐mean age 42.31±14.8 years in PAC and 42.20±12.67 years in PAL (p=0.150); 65.7% were males and 34.3% were females in PAC group, 51.4% were males and 48.6% were females in PAL group (p=0.225). Clearance of infection was seen in 23 patients (65.7%) in PAL group as compared to 32 patients (91.4%) in the PAC (p=0.01). Among patients with failure of eradication, 3 (1.05%) from PAC group and 12 (4.20%) from PAL group had persistence of dyspeptic symptoms. In addition, 7.14% (5 out of 70‐two from PAC and three from PAL group) of subjects who had H. pylori eradication had persistence of same symptoms of dyspepsia on follow‐up at four weeks after completion of the regimen. Conclusion: A 14 days clarithromycin based triple drug regimen is more effective than 10 days levofloxacin based triple drug regime for the eradication of H. pylori infection."

Frequently, interventions do not consider behaviours or transmission pathways specific to age. A household playspace (HPS) is one intervention component which may block faecal‐oral transmission. This study was a two‐armed, parallel‐group, randomised, controlled feasibility trial of a HPS in rural Ethiopia. It aimed to recommend proceeding to a definitive trial. Secondary outcomes included effects on infant health, injury prevention and women's time. METHODS: November 2019‐January 2020 106 households were identified and assessed for eligibility. Recruited households (N = 100) were randomised (blinded prior to the trial start) to intervention or control (both n = 50). Outcomes included recruitment, attrition, adherence, and acceptability. Data were collected at baseline, two and four weeks. FINDINGS: Recruitment met a priori criteria (≥80%). There was no loss to follow‐up, and no non‐use, meeting adherence criteria (both ≤10%). Further, 48.0% (95% CI 33.7‐62.6; n = 24) of households appropriately used and 56.0% (41.3‐70.0; n = 28) cleaned the HPS over four weeks, partly meeting adherence criteria (≥50%). For acceptability, 41.0% (31.3‐51.3; n = 41) of infants were in the HPS during random visits, failing criteria (≥50%). Further, the proportion of HPS use decreased during some activities, failing criteria (no decrease in use). A modified Barrier Analysis described good acceptability and multiple secondary benefits, including on women's time burden and infant injury prevention. INTERPRETATION: Despite failing some a priori criteria, the trial demonstrated mixed adherence and good acceptability among intervention households. A definitive trial to determine efficacy is warranted if recommended adjustments are made. FUNDING: People In Need; Czech Development Agency. TRIAL REGISTRATION: RIDIE‐ID‐5de0b6938afb8."

Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection for BLI group was 91.7%, 88.9%, 91.7%, 88.9%, and 95.2% respectively. BLI can detect lesion more correctly than NBI (95.2% vs. 66.7%, p = 0.053). Conclusions: RAC could be an important finding for absence of H. pylori infection by white light endoscopy. Image‐enhanced endoscopy by blue laser imaging (BLI) might be useful technique to improve real‐time diagnosis of H. pylori infection. [Formula presented]"
"Otomycosis in Immunocompetent Patients with Intact Tympanic Membrane","Venugopalan, S; Choksi, VP; Tejura, J; Fefar, AD","Otorhinolaryngology clinics","10.5005/JP-JOURNALS-10003-1524","16","2","2024","Aim: To know the causative organisms of otomycosis in hot and humid regions in immunocompetent patients and determine the efficacy of clotrimazole topical ear drops in the eradication of the disease. Materials and methods: A retrospective randomized clinical study in the Otorhinolaryngology Department at a Tertiary care hospital with sixty‐seven immunocompetent patients presenting with complaints of ear itching, ear blockage, and thick ear discharge. After a general examination followed by an otoscopic examination, a sample was taken from the affected ear over sterile cotton swabs and sent for fungal stain and culture. Results: Equal incidence was observed among all age‐groups and both genders. The most common presentation was predominantly unilateral ear itching (20 patients: 30%) and itching associated with unilateral ear blockage (17 patients: 25%). The most common otoscopic finding was black spores in the External Auditory Canal (EAC) (50 patients: 75%) followed by thick dirty white discharge in EAC (17 patients: 25%). The most common incriminating fungus was Aspergillus niger (35 patients: 52%) followed by Aspergillus flavus (25 patients: 37%). The cure rate with aural toilet on presentation and Clotrimazole (1%) topical ear drops for seven days in the affected ear is 100%. Conclusion: Otomycosis is an endemic disease in hot and humid regions, affecting the masses including the immunocompetent. However, it resolves by topical clotrimazole without any sequelae and has an excellent prognosis in immunocompetent. Clinical significance: Even though multiple studies have been conducted for otomycosis in diseased ears, more studies with greater sample sizes need to be conducted to understand the prevalence and etiology of otomycosis in dry, normal ears. Level of evidence: Outcomes research, Randomized clinical trial."
"Prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia by a nose care program combining with oral care among patients hospitalized in intensive care units: a single-blind randomized controlled trial","Halili, A; Ghafari, S; Saghaei, M; Atashi, V","Medicina clinica practica","10.1016/j.mcpsp.2023.100401","7","1","2024","Objective: Ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the most common ICU‐acquired infections. Preventing nasal canal colonization through an effective nasal cavity care, along with oral care seem to be an important issue. Methods: This single‐blind randomized controlled trial was conducted on 31 patients in each intervention and control group in Alzahra and Kashani hospitals, Iran. The interventional program was considered every 8 h for 5 days. It included cleaning the nasal cavities with cotton swabs soaked in sterile normal saline, then 2 puffs of 65% sodium chloride nasal spray were used for each nostril, and finally the nasal canal was moistened with a swab dipped in Veramin gel (0.5 ml into each nostril). For the control group, routine nasal care including cleaning the outer nostrils was offered. Oral care in 2 groups was performed according to the standard protocol. Data collected through demographic and clinical questionnaire as well as modified pulmonary infection clinical scale. The chi‐square and independent tests were used to determine the homogeneity of basic characteristics. Also, we estimated and compared the incidence of VAP between 2 groups by chi‐square test. Results: The incidence of VAP was not statistically different in the intervention and control groups on the third day after intervention (29.1% vs. 32.3%, respectively, P = .915), while this rate on the sixth day was significantly lesser in the intervention than control (32.3 vs. 58%, P = .041). Conclusion: The present nasal care program along with oral care is an effective strategy to prevent VAP."
