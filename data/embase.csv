Probiotic treatment in an intensive care unit: a narrative review,,Takeaki S.,6/11/25,6/24/25,Journal of Intensive Care (2025) 13:1 Article Number: 31. Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2025,Journal of Intensive Care,2025,13,1,,,1-Dec-25,Review,2052-0492 (electronic),"Diarrhea is common in critically ill patients and can lead to malnutrition, electrolyte imbalance, and dehydration. While its direct impact on outcomes, such as mortality or intensive care unit (ICU) stay, remains unclear due to inconsistent definitions, it often results from drug-induced causes, such as antibiotics and antacids. These agents can also contribute to dysbiosis and increase the risk of infections including Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Probiotics, defined as live beneficial microorganisms, can counteract dysbiosis by modulating immune responses, restoring microbial balance, and reducing intestinal inflammation. Evidence suggests that probiotics may help prevent diarrhea and secondary infections. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that probiotics may reduce the incidence of VAP, length of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and potential in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients. However, evaluating probiotic efficacy remains challenging due to the lack of standardized markers and the influence of confounding factors like antacid use. In a randomized controlled trial, synbiotic therapy was associated with improved fecal microbiota and reduced infections; however, the role of antacids was not addressed. Probiotics are generally safe, although rare adverse events, such as probiotic-associated bacteremia, have been reported, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The 2024 Japanese Critical Care Nutrition Guidelines included a systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the potential benefits of probiotics in critically ill patients. However, due to significant heterogeneity in strains, dosing, duration, and concurrent antibiotic/antacid use, a weak recommendation (GRADE 2C; low certainty) was issued. Future research should focus on the standardized evaluation of diarrhea and microbiota changes, the use of objective markers—such as fecal pH and short-chain fatty acid levels—and clarification of the interactions of probiotics with other medications. Comprehensive bowel management, including the cautious use of antibiotics and antacids, may be essential to fully recognize the therapeutic potential of probiotics in critical care settings.",,"Critically ill patients,Diarrhea,Probiotics",10.1186/s40560-025-00803-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40560-025-00803-0
Fecal microbiota transplantation for Parkinson's disease: A systematic review of clinical evidence,,"Shekar S., Venkatachalapathy R., Jayaraman A., Sai Supra Siddhu N.",5/14/25,5/16/25,Medicine in Microecology (2025) 25 Article Number: 100128. Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2025,Medicine in Microecology,2025,25,,,,1-Sep-25,Review,2590-0978 (electronic),"Targeting the gut-brain axis, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has become a cutting-edge therapeutic strategy for treating Parkinson's disease (PD), reducing both motor and non-motor symptoms. With an emphasis on gut microbiota changes, disease progression, and symptom alleviation, this systematic review assesses the safety and effectiveness of FMT in PD patients. Four RCTs, one observational research, one non-randomized control study, one case series, and one case report were among the eight papers that were considered; these studies comprised 144 patients in total. Key findings show that FMT has a good safety profile with only mild to severe adverse effects observed, and it significantly improves PD symptoms, notably constipation. Colonic, Nasointestinal, and oral administration were among the delivery routes used to assess treatment effectiveness using the MDS-UPDRS scale. The research reveals differences in the makeup of microbiota and emphasizes how FMT may affect the gut-brain axis, hence resolving neurological abnormalities in Parkinson's disease. Small sample numbers, variations in FMT methods, and the absence of long-term follow-up data are some of the limitations. This study highlights FMT's potential as an adjunctive treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), especially in improving patient quality of life and reducing non-motor symptoms. To provide standardized procedures and validate long-term safety and effectiveness, bigger multicentre trials are necessary.",,"FMT,Gut-brain axis,Gut-microbiota,Parkinson's,Safety",10.1016/j.medmic.2025.100128,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.medmic.2025.100128
Use of pectin-supplemented enteral nutrition in intensive care: A systematic review and meta-analysis,,"Huang H.-B., Zhu Y.-B., Yu D.-X.",5/14/25,5/20/25,Clinical Nutrition ESPEN (2025) 68 (62-70). Date of Publication: 1 Aug 2025,Clinical Nutrition ESPEN,2025,68,,62,70,1-Aug-25,Article,2405-4577 (electronic),"Background: Pectin is a water-soluble dietary fiber that has been widely used in hospitalized patients. However, there is insufficient high-quality evidence to support its use in critically ill patients. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pectin-supplemented enteral nutrition (PSEN) on diarrhea and other important outcomes in this patient population. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and the Cochrane database for relevant articles from inception to Oct 15, 2023. Studies were included if they focused on adult ICU patients receiving PSEN compared to controls. The primary outcome was diarrhea. We assessed study quality and performed subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, GRADE system and trial sequential analysis (TSA) to explore potential heterogeneity among the included studies. Results: Twelve trials with 1,405 patients were included. Overall, PSEN significantly reduced the risk of diarrhea (odds ratio [OR] = 0.40; 95 % CI, 0.30–0.54; P < 0.00001). This finding was confirmed in further subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Of note, PSEN significantly reduced the risk of diarrhea in patients who did not use PPIs but not in those who did. PSEN also significantly reduced infectious complications (OR = 0.43; 95 % CI, 0.26–0.70; P = 0.0007), ICU length of stay (MD = −3.59 days; 95 % CI, −7.13 to −0.05; P = 0.05), and hospital length of stay (MD = −6.79 days; 95 % CI, −10.24 to −3.34; P = 0.0001). In addition, PSEN significantly reduced intestinal intolerance symptoms (vomiting [OR = 0.27; 95 % CI, 0.15–0.48], feeding intolerance [OR = 0.39; 95 % CI, 0.22–0.68], abdominal distension [OR = 0.22; 95 % CI, 0.22–0.46] and severe constipation [OR = 0.20; 95 % CI, 0.12–0.35]) and nutrition status (shorter time to target EN amount [MD = −1.81 days; 95 % CI, −2.18 to −1.44] and prealbumin changes [MD = −1.81 days; 95 % CI, −2.18 to −1.44]) but did not affect mortality (OR = 0.86; 95 % CI, 0.56–1.33) in this patient population. TSA and sensitivity analyses confirmed the primary findings. Conclusions: PSEN significantly had better feeding intolerance, and improved important clinical outcomes. Further studies with better PSEN protocol are required to validate our findings.",,"Critical illness,Diarrhea,Enteral nutrition,Meta-analysis,Pectin",10.1016/j.clnesp.2025.04.008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2025.04.008
"Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on pre-, pro-, post- and synbiotic supplementation in follow-on formula",,"Delcourt H., Verbrugghe L., Vandenplas Y., Huysentruyt K.",6/23/25,6/27/25,Clinical Nutrition (2025) 51 (101-114).

The aim of this study is to summarize high quality evidence from randomized controlled trials on the health benefits (respiratory tract infections, diarrheal episodes, febrile days, antibiotic use, microbiome modulation and secretory IgA) of prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and postbiotics added to follow-on formula. Methods: A comprehensive literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using Medline, Embase, Lilacs, and Cochrane was performed up to February 2025 (PROSPERO CRD42024500457). Only RCTs involving healthy children between six months and three years were considered. Quality assessment was done using the ROBINS II tool. Random effects models were used to obtain odd ratio (OR) and number needed to treat (NNT) via meta-analysis. Results: Out of 2755 search results, 23 studies were included (n = 6984 children) with an overall low risk of bias (14/23) as assessed by the Robins II tool. The OR for respiratory tract infections in pro-,pre- and synbiotics added to a follow-on formula was 0.22 (95 % CI: 0.05–1.09; NNT = 82; CI 95 %: 67–674), 0.84 (95 % CI: 0.66–1.07; NNT = 28; 95 % CI: 11–75) and 0.75 (95 % CI: 0.54–1.05; NNT = 18; 95 % CI: 9–102), respectively. The OR for diarrheal episodes in pre- and synbiotics added to a follow-on formula 1.40 (95 % CI: 0.71–2.79; NNT = 40, 95 % CI: 10–53) and 1.26 (95 % CI: 0.96–1.66; NNT = 17, 95%CI: 8–94), respectively. For the combination of other interventions with other outcomes insufficient studies were available to perform a meta-analysis. Conclusion: Pre- and synbiotics may help protect against respiratory tract infection, though they do not appear to offer the same benefit for preventing diarrheal episodes. High quality evidence for the effect of biotics added to follow-on formula on health outcomes is sparse. More research is needed to confirm the observed health effects.",,"Follow-on formula,Prebiotic,Probiotic,Synbiotic",10.1016/j.clnu.2025.05.022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2025.05.022
Effect of long-term azithromycin treatment on gut microbial diversity in children and adolescents with HIV-associated chronic lung disease,,"Flygel T.T., Bargheet A., Abotsi R.E., Claassen-Weitz S., Simms V., Hjerde E., Mwaikono K.S., Mchugh G., Hameiri-Bowen D., Pettersen V.K., Ferrand R.A., Nicol M., Cavanagh J.P., Flaegstad T., Sovershaeva E.",7/10/25,7/15/25,eBioMedicine (2025) 118 Article Number: 105832. Date of Publication: 1 Aug 2025,eBioMedicine,2025,118,,,,1-Aug-25,Article,2352-3964 (electronic),"Background: HIV-associated chronic lung disease (HCLD) is common in children and adolescents growing up with HIV. The use of azithromycin (AZM) reduces the rate of acute respiratory exacerbations in this population, however, impact of this treatment on the gut microbiota and associations with blood-derived inflammatory markers have not been studied. Methods: Children and adolescents with HCLD in Harare, Zimbabwe and Blantyre, Malawi were recruited in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of once-weekly AZM or placebo for 48 weeks (BREATHE trial, NCT02426112). Rectal swabs were collected at inclusion (N = 346), 48 weeks (treatment end, N = 313), and 72 weeks (six months after treatment cessation, N = 244). The bacterial composition of fecal swabs was determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Plasma biomarkers at inclusion and 48 weeks were measured using Luminex multiplex bead assay. Findings: At 48 weeks, bacterial α-diversity was significantly lower in the AZM group, with 27 bacterial genera showing differential abundance between the study groups. The placebo group exhibited higher interconnectivity between bacterial genera at 48 weeks compared to the AZM group. Correlations between the top seven differentially abundant genera and biomarkers observed at inclusion were no longer significant at 48 weeks in both groups. Depletion of Campylobacter persisted for six months after cessation of AZM treatment. Interpretation: Long-term AZM treatment in HCLD patients affects their gut bacterial composition at least 6 months after its cessation. The consequences of reduced bacterial diversity, such as altered interaction with the immune system and risk of resistance, need further investigation to understand how to optimise gut health during long-term antibiotic treatments.

Reporting quality and evidence support in randomized controlled trials of herbal medicine formulas for vestibular migraine,,"Wang L., Zheng J., Yang J., Feng Q., Liu J., Lu Z., Zhang J., Zheng G.",6/3/25,6/20/25,Phytomedicine (2025) 143 Article Number: 156864. Date of Publication: 25 Jul 2025,Phytomedicine,2025,143,,,,25-Jul-25,Article,"1618-095X (electronic),0944-7113","Background: Vestibular migraine (VM) is a prevalent condition characterized by recurrent episodes of dizziness, vertigo, and/or headache, often posing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have highlighted potential benefits of herbal medicine formulas (HMFs) for treating VM. However, current evidence remains insufficient to recommend their routine clinical use. The validity of trial results relies heavily on the completeness of the reporting. Therefore, this study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the reporting quality and evidence support of RCTs investigating HMFs for VM. Methods: We performed a comprehensive search across eight databases from their inception to August 2024. The included studies were primarily RCTs assessing the effectiveness and safety of HMFs for treating VM. The quality of the RCTs was evaluated using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines, along with its extension for Chinese medicine formulas (CONSORT-CHM Formulas). A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of HMFs for the treatment of VM following the Cochrane methodolog. High-frequency herbal medicines (HMs) for VM treatment were identified as those appearing with a cumulative frequency exceeding 50 % among the top-ranked HMs. Results: A total of 33 RCTs involving 2358 patients with VM were included. The mean score for CONSORT reporting items was 14.24, while the mean score for CONSORT-CHM reporting items was 13.64. Few trials adequately reported essential elements such as appropriate titles, sample size calculations, allocation concealment, randomization implementation, and descriptions of blinding within the CONSORT core items. For CONSORT-CHM, less than half of the studies specified the formula names, dosage forms, and targeted traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) patterns in their titles and abstracts. Most studies demonstrated a high risk of bias, particularly regarding randomization sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding. The meta-analysis indicates that HMFs are effective in treating VM with minimal adverse effects; however, the high heterogeneity in certain outcomes suggests a potential risk of bias. The five most frequently used herbs across all studies were, in descending order: Gastrodiae Rhizoma, Rhizoma Pinelliae, Rhizoma Chuanxiong, Poria, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma. Conclusions: The meta-analysis supports the effectiveness and safety of HMFs for treating VM, with a low incidence of adverse events. However, the CONSORT and CONSORT-CHM reporting items were underreported. Future RCTs should strictly adhere to these guidelines to enhance reporting quality, ensuring full transparency in study design and methodolog. This study contributes to a more rigorous evidence base for HMFs in VM treatment. It aims to improve the quality of future RCTs involving herbal formulas for VM, enabling clinicians to make better-informed decisions.",,"CONSORT,CONSORT-CHM,Herbal medicine formulas,Meta-analysis,Risk of bias,Vestibular migraine",10.1016/j.phymed.2025.156864,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2025.156864

Data Sources: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology through July 2024 that evaluated the efficacy and safety of mifepristone and misoprostol together compared to misoprostol alone for the resolution of miscarriage and intrauterine fetal death through July 2024. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Primary endpoints were overall delivery success, 24-hour delivery success, and incidence of safety outcomes. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant, and heterogeneity was reported as the I(2) value. Data Synthesis: Twelve randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Overall delivery success was higher in the intervention group (0.73 [CI 0.64-0.82], P < 0.01). Twenty-four-hour delivery rate was higher (1.54 [CI 1.32-1.77], P = 0.06), and a shorter time to delivery interval (9.22-18.78 vs 15.47-37.1 hours) was observed in the intervention group. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were more frequent in the intervention group (0.04 [CI –0.03 to 0.12], P < 0.01). Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Mifepristone and misoprostol together demonstrated higher delivery success rates and comparable safety outcomes to misoprostol alone, demonstrating the potential of improving patient care and positively impacting the time to successful delivery for patients at the bedside.

As available B. clausii preparations differ in regard to strain composition and pharmaceutical quality, we focused on the most frequently investigated preparation that is available under the brand name Enterogermina(®), which includes a combination of the O/C, SIN, N/R, and T strains. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis including several newer studies. We identified 11 randomized and three non-randomized controlled trials. A meta-analysis was performed for the three most often reported parameters in the randomized trials, i.e., duration of diarrhea, number of stools, and duration of hospital stay. Risk of bias was assessed using the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination criteria. Risk of bias of the randomized trials was classified as fair to good. The duration of diarrhea was reduced by 0.6 Hedge's g, the number of stools by 0.34 Hedge's g, and the duration of hospital stay by 0.27 Hedge's g (p < 0.05 for all three parameters). Several other parameters also appeared improved. Adverse events were absent or similarly present in the B. clausii and control groups. We conclude that the B. clausii preparation analyzed here is an effective and well-tolerated treatment of acute gastroenteritis in children.

Benefits of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have been shown in phase I studies, but route and dose-related questions remain. Methods: We performed a phase II randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial of capsule and enema FMT in patients with cirrhosis and HE on lactulose and rifaximin. Participants were randomized into four groups (3 active doses; 2 active and 1 placebo dose; 1 active and 2 placebo doses; 3 placebo doses). Each patient received two capsules and one enema (either placebo or FMT) and were followed for 6 months. The primary outcome was FMT-related (serious) adverse events ([s]AEs)/AEs using intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes were HE recurrence, all-cause hospitalizations, death, donor engraftment, and quality-of-life. FMT was from a vegan or omnivorous donor. Results: We enrolled 60 patients (15/group) with similar baseline characteristics. FMT was safe, with no FMT-related SAEs/AEs reported. Overall SAEs (p = 0.96) or death (p = 1.0) were similar. There were significant differences in HE recurrence between groups (p = 0.035, Cramer's V = 0.39). On post hoc analysis, recurrence was highest in the all-placebo vs. any FMT group (40% vs. 9%; odds ratio 0.15, 95% CI 0.04–0.64). Within the FMT groups, HE recurrence rates were similar regardless of route, doses, or donor type. Quality of life improved in FMT-recipient groups. Engraftment was highest in those with high pre-FMT Lachnospiraceae and lower in those whose HE recurred. Conclusions: FMT was safe in patients with cirrhosis and HE on maximal therapy, with no FMT-related AEs reported, regardless of dose, route, or donor type. On post hoc analysis, HE recurrence was highest in the placebo-only group and linked with lower baseline Lachnospiraceae and reduced donor engraftment. Impact and implications: Patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) already on maximal therapy could have recurrences, which worsen prognosis and are not prioritized for liver transplant. In this phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with cirrhosis and prior overt HE, we found that fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) was safe and well tolerated regardless of route of delivery (oral or enema), number of doses (1 through 3), or donor type (vegan or omnivorous). HE recurrence, which was a key secondary endpoint, was different between groups and, on post hoc analysis, lowest in groups that received any FMT. Donor engraftment was higher in those with higher relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was associated with lower HE recurrence.",,"donors,engraftment,falls,fecal microbiota transplant,hospitalizations,Lachnospiraceae,lactulose,outcomes,recurrence,Rifaximin",10.1016/j.jhep.2024.12.047,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2024.12.047

The IBD therapies currently used to treat PSC-IBD patients have side effects and can be costly. Oral vancomycin (OV) - a safe, economical, and convenient therapy - has been reported to be a salvage therapy in refractory PSC-IBD patients. This systematic review aims to summarize the current literature regarding the effectiveness and safety of OV to treat IBD in PSC patients. Methods A systematic literature review of Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and CINAHL was performed until March 2024. The Murad scale, Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool were used to determine the quality of the case reports and case series, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trial (RCT), respectively. The outcomes sought were response or remission across clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, and histological parameters. Results Of the 1725 published studies, we identified 9 case reports, 7 case series, 3 cohort studies, and 1 RCT. Most studies reported an improvement in clinical IBD symptoms such as diarrhea and hematochezia. Fewer publications provided supporting objective data in the form of fecal calprotectin, endoscopic Mayo scores, and histology. There were no reports of vancomycin-resistant enterococci infections. Conclusions Oral vancomycin appears safe and effective to treat IBD in a subset of PSC patients. Future studies would benefit from prospective data collection incorporating standardized symptomatic, endoscopic, and histologic indices. Ultimately, a well-powered RCT is needed to better assess the effectiveness, safety, and durability of OV therapy.",,"inflammatory bowel disease,oral vancomycin,primary sclerosing cholangitis",10.1093/ibd/izae257,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ibd/izae257

Oral Chinese medicine, as the main treatment method of traditional Chinese medicine, is widely used in the treatment of gallstones. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese medicine combined with Western medicine for the treatment of gallstones. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), and Chinese BioMedical Literature Database. The search time was set to be up to July 2, 2024. Data analysis using Revman 5.3 software. The protocol is registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42024567327). Results: Ultimately, 912 patients from 8 randomized controlled trials were included. The meta-analysis results of traditional Chinese medicine combined with Western medicine versus Western medicine were as follows: imaging examination (standardized mean difference, SMD = -1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] (-2.36, -0.65), P < .001), total cholesterol level (SMD = -2.14, 95% CI (-3.61, -0.67), P = .004), total bile acid level (SMD = -0.97, 95% CI (-3.36, -1.42), P = .043), traditional Chinese medicine symptom scores (SMD = -1.88, 95% CI (-3.16, -0.60), P = .004), occurrence of adverse reaction (odds ratio = 0.51, 95% CI (0.21, 1.24), P = .14). Conclusion: The curative effect of Chinese medicine combined with Western medicine in the treatment of gallstones is better than that of Western medicine and is safety.

It accounted for 444,000 child mortalities in 2021, and indiscriminate use of antibiotics in its management is reported to contribute significantly to increase in antibiotic resistance. The objective of this study was to identify herbal drugs which are efficacious in acute diarrhea treatment. This systematic review assessed the efficacy of herbal medicines in treating acute diarrhea through the analysis of randomized controlled trials. The review followed PRISMA and the Cochrane Handbook guidelines. Literature search was performed in PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Central, and a clinical trial registry for studies involving human subjects with acute diarrhea and herbal medicine (HM) interventions. Primary outcome measures included stool consistency, stool frequency, duration of diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and pyrexia. The search found 2581 articles, of which 9 involving 916 participants (72% children, 27% adults) were analyzed. The studies span 1976–2022, and assessed: Boswellia serrata (Indian frankincense), Rheum ribes L. (rhubarb), Camellia sinensis (black tea), Potentilla tormentilla (Septfoil), apple pectin-chamomile extract, kaolin-pectin, Dirasif (multi-herbal preparation), Psidium guajava (guava folia), and Dowdo (wheat and milk herbal feed). The studies had varying participant age ranges, diarrhea causes, and risks of bias. Only C. sinensis was able to reduce stool consistency, while R. ribes and B. serrata reduced diarrhea duration significantly. Other HMs had positive effects on abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and pyrexia. Studies on C. sinensis B. serrata extract, R. ribes, and P. tormentilla extract demonstrated significant efficacy and, low to moderate risk of bias.",,"Acute diarrhea,Herbal medicine,Plant extracts,Traditional medicine",10.1007/s13596-024-00766-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13596-024-00766-x

Data Sources: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (January 2015 to May 2024). Search terms included: “cefepime-enmetazobactam” or “cefepime” or “enmetazobactam” or “cefepime” or “novel beta-lactamase inhibitor” and “complicated urinary tract infection” or “cUTI.” Conference abstracts, bibliographies, clinical trials, and drug monographs were included for review. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Relevant studies in English and clinical trials conducted in humans were reviewed. Data Synthesis: In February 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the combination beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (BL/BLI) FEP-EMT for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) and acute pyelonephritis following the completion of the Phase III ALLIUM trial comparing it to piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP). The trial resulted in 79.1% of the FEP-EMT group versus 58.9% of the TZP group meeting the primary outcome of clinical cure and microbiological eradication (95% CI 21.2 [14.3 to 27.9]). Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice in Comparison to Existing Agents: This review describes the use of FEP-EMT for the treatment of cUTI and compares its use to other novel BL/BLI combinations including utility in drug-resistant infections. Conclusions: FEP-EMT provides an antimicrobial option to reduce overuse of carbapenems for extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae. However, unlike other novel BL/BLI combinations, its limited spectrum of antibacterial effect for more difficult-to-treat pathogens and cost may also impact its overall utilization.",,"beta-lactam,beta-lactamase inhibitor,cefepime-enmetazobactam,complicated urinary tract infection,novel antibiotics",10.1177/10600280241279904,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10600280241279904
Probiotics and Prebiotics Intervention in Respiratory and Digestive Infections Linked to Covid-19,,"Amrouche T., Lammi S., Drider D.",12/6/24,5/27/25,Probiotics and Antimicrobial Proteins (2025) 17:3 (1356-1367).

This review aims to analyze the main and recent advances related to viral infections such as Covid-19 and its gastrointestinal complications, antiviral immunity generated and possible preventive role that probiotics and/or prebiotics can play in controlling and promoting antiviral immunity. The literature search was performed through a critical analysis of relevant publications reported in PubMed and Scopus databases on clinical trials and assays conducted in vitro on colon cells and in vivo on mice. Some studies using probiotics and prebiotics for the prevention of viral infection in different age groups are discussed. Covid-19 patients have been shown to suffer from gastrointestinal complications in addition to respiratory symptoms due to interactions between the respiratory system and the gastrointestinal tract infected with SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, therapies used to prevent (or treat) symptoms of Covid-19 have proven to be of limited effectiveness. In addition, the lack of access to coronavirus vaccines around the world and vaccine hesitancy continue to hamper control of Covid-19. It is therefore crucial to find alternative methods that can prevent disease symptoms. Evidence-based efficacy of certain probiotics (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) that may be useful in viral infections was shown with immunomodulatory properties (pro-inflammatory mediators reduction), promoting antiviral immunity (antibodies production, virus titers) and controlling inflammation (anti-inflammatory effect), as well as viral clearance and antimicrobial potential against opportunistic bacteria (anti-dysbiosis effect). But, available data about clinical application of probiotics in Covid-19 context remain limited and relevant scientific investigation is still in its early stages. Also, evidence for prebiotics potential in this field is limited, since the exact mechanism involved in systemic immune modulation by these compounds is till now unknown. Thus, further research is necessary to explore in the viral infection context the mechanism by which gut and lung interact in the presence of probiotics and prebiotics through more animal and clinical experiments.",,"Gut,Immunomodulation,Lung,Prebiotic,Probiotic,Viral infection",10.1007/s12602-024-10404-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12602-024-10404-2
Selective decontamination of the digestive tract in burn patients: A systematic review with meta-analysis,,"Tsuchiya E.A., Jensen-Abbew J., Krag M., Møller M.H., Vestergaard M.R., Haase N., Helleberg M., Holmgaard R., Heiberg J.",4/22/25,4/29/25,Burns (2025) 51:5 Article Number: 107501.

While the benefits of SDD have been documented in this population, it remains unclear whether burn patients, who are at increased risk of infection and have distinct clinical characteristics, may experience similar benefits. In this systematic review we aimed to assess the desirable and undesirable patient-important effects of administering SDD to burn patients. Methods/design: We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of SDD versus placebo or no SDD in burn patients. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included serious adverse events, antimicrobial resistance, pneumonia, blood stream infections, ICU- and hospital-free days, and 90-day mortality. We searched all major databases and followed the recommendations provided by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The certainty of evidence was assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results: We identified four RCTs with a total of 457 burn patients. All trials were assessed as having either ‘some concerns’ or ‘high risk’ of bias. The evidence was found to be very uncertain across all outcomes assessed. For mortality, the relative risk (RR) was 0.62 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.22–1.78, I(2) = 75 %, random-effects model (REM), very low certainty evidence). For pneumonia, the RR was 0.75 (95 % CI 0.48–1.19, I(2) = 0 %, fixed-effect model, very low certainty evidence). For bloodstream infections, the RR was 1.10 (95 % CI 0.71–1.69, I(2) = 0 %, REM, very low certainty evidence). For hospital length of stay, the mean difference was −2.03 days (95 % CI −9.64–5.59, I(2) = 51 %, REM, very low certainty evidence). We did not perform meta-analyses for the remaining secondary outcomes due to limited or no data. Trial sequential analysis could not be performed due to insufficient number of total participants and events in the included trials. Conclusion: We found that the certainty of evidence is very low about the effects of SDD on patient-important outcomes in burn patients. Extrapolating from the evidence on mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients may be reasonable until more data from RCTs in burn patients emerge.",,"antibiotic prophylaxis,bacteremia,burns,gastrointestinal tract,infections,pneumonia",10.1016/j.burns.2025.107501,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.burns.2025.107501

DESIGN: Bedside nurses prospectively documented each patient's bowel movement (BM) using the Bristol Stool Chart type and number. Research Coordinators collected baseline and daily data evaluating risk factors for diarrhea and patient outcomes. The diarrhea definition was the World Health Organization definition of ≥3 loose or watery BMs (Bristol type 6 or 7) per day. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate risk factors and the association with the risk of death in the ICU. SETTING: Forty-four ICUs in Canada, the United States, and Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS: All 2,650 invasively ventilated critically ill patients were enrolled in this preplanned secondary analysis of a randomized trial that evaluated the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG on infectious outcomes. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 2,650 patients, the mean age (sd) was 59.8 (16.5) years, with an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II Score of 22.0 (7.8); 61.2% received inotropes/vasopressors on study day 1. Diarrhea occurred among 60.4% of patients and on 18.2% of ICU study days. Independent risk factors for diarrhea were a history of Clostridioides difficile infection, laxatives, and antibiotic use. Adjusted for these factors, enteral nutrition, particularly with moderate-high-protein content, also increased the risk of diarrhea. Univariable analysis suggested that diarrhea was associated with C. difficile testing, fecal management device insertion, and increased length of ICU and hospital stay. After adjusting for illness severity, mechanical ventilation, inotropes/vasopressors, renal replacement therapy, and severe infections, diarrhea was not associated with an increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhea is common among invasively ventilated patients.

However, comprehensive reviews integrating the diverse therapeutic effects of probiotics in human subjects have been limited. By analyzing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, this review provides a comprehensive overview of key developments in probiotic interventions targeting gut, liver, skin, vaginal, mental, and oral health. Emerging evidence supports the efficacy of specific probiotic strains and combinations in treating a wide range of disorders, from gastrointestinal (GI) and liver diseases to dermatological conditions, bacterial vaginosis, mental disorders, and oral diseases. We discuss the expanding understanding of microbiome-organ connections underlying probiotic mechanisms of action. While many clinical trials demonstrate significant benefits, we acknowledge areas requiring further large-scale studies to establish definitive efficacy and optimal treatment protocols. The review addresses challenges in standardizing probiotic research methodologies and emphasizes the importance of considering individual variations in microbiome composition and host genetics. Additionally, we explore emerging concepts such as the oral-gut-brain axis and future directions, including high-resolution microbiome profiling, host-microbe interaction studies, organoid models, and artificial intelligence applications in probiotic research.

BASs were associated with a significant improvement in the cessation of diarrhea (RR 3.27; 95% CI 2.08 to 5.15; P ≤.05) and liquid stool to normal fecal consistency (RR 2.69; 95% CI 1.56 to 4.65; P ≤.05), as well as an increase in abdominal cramps (RR 5.27; 95% CI 1.21 to 22.93; P ≤.05). There were no differences in urgency, adverse events, or nausea between groups. These findings indicate that BASs are effective in the treatment of BAD, as indicated by the improvement or cessation of diarrhea episodes.",,"bile acids and salts,cholestyramine,colesevelam hydrochloride,colestipol,diarrhea",10.1002/jcph.6154,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcph.6154

Methods: This study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guideline. For this systematic review, we used 3 databases for journal searches: PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. This study only included randomized controlled trials or open-label clinical trials. There was no year limit used in the journal search for this systematic review. Findings: Eighteen randomized controlled trials, with a total population of 12,259 patients, were included. Of 18 studies, 15 were used for network meta-analysis. Based on the results of the network meta-analysis, weight loss was found in phentermine/topiramate (mean difference [MD], −3.28; 95% CI, −4.47 to −2.09), semaglutide (MD, −2.92; 95% CI, −4.38 to −1.46), phentermine (MD, −2.31; 95% CI, −3.82 to −0.81), naltrexone/bupropion (MD, −1.68; 95% CI, −2.87 to −0.49), topiramate (MD, −1.67; 95% CI, −2.86 to −0.48), and orlistat (MD, −1.44; 95% CI, −2.32 to −0.55). There were no significant differences among the groups. However, compared with placebo, all oral obesity therapies provide better benefits in weight loss (MD, −2.12; 95% CI, −2.64 to −1.59; P ≤ 0.00001). Implications: Oral antiobesity drugs provide better weight loss than placebo.

AKI is associated with an increased risk of death, prolonged hospital stays, and subsequent transition to chronic kidney disease. Catecholamines have historically been used as the first-line vasopressors for vasodilatory shock; however, they may adversely affect renal function and recovery. Objectives: To compare the effects of catecholamine and noncatecholamine vasopressors on AKI risk and recovery in preclinical and clinical studies of vasodilatory shock. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched to identify studies reporting renal outcomes associated with catecholamine (norepinephrine, epinephrine, metaraminol, phenylephrine, dopamine) and noncatecholamine vasopressors (vasopressin, angiotensin II), in preclinical models or adult cohorts of vasodilatory shock. Two independent reviewers screened studies and extracted data using a prespecified form for qualitative synthesis and risk of bias assessment. Results: Of 3,504 citations, 90 studies were eligible for inclusion: 41 preclinical studies, 17 nonrandomized clinical studies, 28 randomized clinical studies, and 4 post-hoc analyses. Risk of bias was generally low in preclinical studies and low to moderate in clinical studies. In preclinical studies, catecholamine vasopressors exacerbated medullary hypoxia and intrarenal inflammation compared to noncatecholamine vasopressors. In clinical studies, catecholamines were associated with higher serum creatinine, lower urine output, and increased requirements for renal replacement therapy compared to noncatecholamine vasopressors. In patients on high-dose catecholamines, adjunctive angiotensin II was associated with improved renal replacement therapy liberation. Conclusion: Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that noncatecholamine vasopressors may confer renal benefits compared to catecholamine vasopressors.

Gut microbiota development in very preterm infants following fortification of human milk,,"Yang L., Hui Y., Sangild P.T., Kot W.P., Aunsholt L., Zachariassen G., Jiang P.-P., Nielsen D.S.",4/2/25,4/9/25,mSystems (2025) 10:3. Date of Publication: 1 Mar 2025,mSystems,2025,10,3,,,1-Mar-25,Article,2379-5077 (electronic),"Very preterm infants (VPIs) are born with an immature gut and predisposed to gut microbiota dysbiosis-related diseases, for example, necrotizing enterocolitis. Although fortification of human milk is required for these infants, the optimal fortifier remains uncertain. Bovine colostrum (BC), rich in protein and bioactive components, could serve as an alternative to conventional fortifiers (CF). The gut microbiota (GM) of 225 VPIs fed human milk fortified with either BC or CF (FortiColos study, NCT03537365) was profiled by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of fecal samples collected before, and after 1 and 2 weeks of fortification. Birth mode exhibited transient effects on the microbial community structure shortly after birth, with cesarean section-born VPIs dominated by Firmicutes, whereas vaginally born VPIs were dominated by Proteobacteria. This birth mode-derived difference diminished with age and disappeared around 1 month after birth. Fortifier type affected the microbial community structure to a modest extent, but no specific taxa significantly differed between the BC and CF groups. Fecal pH, increased by BC, was positively correlated with Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium and negatively with Bifidobacterium abundance. Change in the relative abundance of Staphylococcus was negatively correlated with body weight gain. Collectively, fortification of human milk with BC or CF does influence the GM of VPIs but only to a modest extent during early life. Birth mode appears to have a significant, but temporary influence on the GM during this period. IMPORTANCE Early life is a key period for gut microbiota (GM) establishment, where enteral feeding plays a significant role. This is also the case for infants born preterm, who, due to their immature gut, are at a high risk of developing GM dysbiosis-related diseases. Human milk is the optimal feed for preterm infants, but it requires fortificationto reach adequate levels of especially protein. Only a few studies have investigated the impact of fortifiers on GM development in preterm infants. Here, we demonstrate that two different bovine milk-based fortifiers, bovine colostrum and a conventional fortifier based on mature bovine milk, exhibit limited effects on the microbial community structure of very preterm infants. These findings suggest that although great care in terms of optimally maturing the preterm infant GM should be taken, the choice of fortifier only has limited impact. In clinical practice, the choice of fortifier can thus be fully focussed on optimizing preterm infant nutrition.",,"birth mode,bovine colostrum,enteral feed,gut microbiota,human milk,nutrient fortifier,preterm infant",10.1128/msystems.00916-24,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00916-24

On the basis of current evidence, metformin reduces gestational weight gain, neonatal hypoglycaemia and macrosomia and increases insulin sensitivity. However, considerable heterogeneity between existing studies and the grouping of aggregate and often inharmonious data within meta-analyses has led to disparate findings regarding the efficacy of metformin in treating hyperglycaemia in GDM. Innovative analytical approaches with stratification by individual-level characteristics (for example, obesity, ethnicity, GDM severity and so on) and treatment regimens (diagnostic criteria, treatment timing and follow-up duration) are needed to establish efficacy across a range of end points and to identify which, if any, subgroups might benefit from metformin treatment during pregnancy.",,,10.1038/s41574-024-01049-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41574-024-01049-w

Date of Publication: 1 Feb 2025,Environmental Health Perspectives,2025,133,2,,,1-Feb-25,Review,"1552-9924 (electronic),0091-6765","BACKGROUND: Studies evaluating how water, sanitation, and/or handwashing (WASH) interventions in low-and middle-income countries impact diarrheal diseases have shown inconsistent results. The prevalence of enteric pathogen infections and diarrhea are highly seasonal and climate-sensitive, which could explain heterogeneous findings. Understanding how season influences the effectiveness of WASH interventions is critical for informing intervention approaches that will be resistant under the varying weather conditions that climate change will bring. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis to test whether and to what extent the impact of WASH interventions on diarrhea differs by season. We searched the literature for randomized and nonrandomized controlled WASH intervention trials and identified the season in which data were collected—rainy, dry, or both—for each study using proximate land station weather datasets. We compared the relative risk (RR) estimates for the impact of interventions on diarrhea for each study, stratified by season, and analyzed estimates using meta-analysis and meta-regression. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021231137. RESULTS: A total of 50 studies met the inclusion criteria, resulting in 34 drinking water intervention estimates, 8 sanitation intervention estimates, and 14 handwashing intervention estimates. Of the total studies, 60% (n = 30) spanned more than one season, with most single-season studies (75%, n = 15) occur-ring exclusively in the dry season. The effect of WASH interventions was stronger in dry seasons than in rainy seasons, with a 33% [95% confidence interval (CI): 24%, 41%] and 18% reduction (95% CI: 5%, 29%) in diarrhea risk, respectively. When stratified by type of intervention, the stronger effect size in dry seasons was consistent for water and handwashing interventions but not for sanitation interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of the seasonal impact of WASH interventions revealed larger effects in the dry season than in the rainy season overall and for water and handwashing interventions in particular. These patterns likely affected previous estimates of intervention effectiveness, which included more dry season estimates. These findings suggest the need to collect data across seasons and report seasonally stratified results to allow for more accurate estimates of the burden of disease impacted by WASH investments and to improve projections of potential impacts of these interventions under future climate conditions. These findings also underscore the need for robust WASH interventions designed to be resistant to seasonal variations in temperature and rainfall now and under future climate change scenarios.",,,10.1289/EHP14502,http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/EHP14502

Objective: The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics supplementation in patients with IBD. Data Sources: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of probiotics in patients with IBD were searched in PubMed, the Google Scholar database, Web of Science, and CrossRef for the period July 2003 to June 2023. Data Extraction: The RCTs were extracted, independently by 2 authors, according to the PICOS criteria. Data Analysis: Seven studies, including a total of 795 patients, met the study criteria. Five end points were selected to evaluate the efficacy. Of these, 3 indicators showed a statistically significant difference in efficacy: C-reactive protein (odds ratio [OR]: –2.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: –3.16, –1.73, P < .01), the number of fecal Bifidobacterium (OR: 3.37, 95% CI: 3.28, 3.47, P < .01), and Lactobacillus(OR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.91, 2.09, P < .01). The other 2 indicators (disease activity for Crohn’s disease and for ulcerative colitis) showed no statistically significant difference, while the OR reflected a positive correlation.

The purpose of this Part II follow-up article is to provide a systematic overview of the experimental psychopharmacology of ASD. To this aim, we have first identified in the Clinicaltrials.gov website all the 157 pharmacological and nutraceutical compounds which have been experimentally tested in children and adolescents with ASD using the randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) design. After excluding 24 drugs already presented in Part I, a systematic review spanning each of the remaining 133 compounds was registered on Prospero (ID: CRD42023476555), performed on PubMed (August 8, 2024), and completed with EBSCO, PsycINFO (psychology and psychiatry literature) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews, yielding a total of 115 published RCTs, including 57 trials for 23 pharmacological compounds and 48 trials for 17 nutraceuticals/supplements. Melatonin and oxytocin were not included, because recent systematic reviews have been already published for both these compounds. RCTs of drugs with the strongest foundation in preclinical research, namely arbaclofen, balovaptan and bumetanide have all failed to reach their primary end-points, although efforts to target specific patient subgroups do warrant further investigation. For the vast majority of compounds, including cannabidiol, vasopressin, and probiotics, insufficient evidence of efficacy and safety is available. However, a small subset of compounds, including N-acetylcysteine, folinic acid, L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, sulforaphane, and metformin may already be considered, with due caution, for clinical use, because there is promising evidence of efficacy and a high safety profile. For several other compounds, such as secretin, efficacy can be confidently excluded, and/or the data discourage undertaking new RCTs.

This study aimed to review the robotic and laparoscopic procedures for CRC performed in Africa, and compare the mean surgery duration, blood loss, hospital stay, rate of conversion, and prevalence of morbidity and mortality. This is the first study to compare the outcomes of robotic and laparoscopic surgeries for CRC in Africa. Methods: A systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines was conducted. PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, AJOL, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched, identifying 2,259 publications, 33 of which were deemed eligible. Statistical analysis of outcomes was performed using “R”. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane ROBINS-I tool. Results: The minimally invasive approach has been applied for CRC treatment in seven African countries: Algeria, Cameroon, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa. Laparoscopic surgeries accounted for 1,485 (95%) of cases, while 71 (5%) were robotic. Robotic procedures were associated with a longer surgery duration (256.41 min vs. 190.45 min, p < 0.0001), higher blood loss (226.48 mL vs. 141.55 mL, p < 0.0001), and a shorter hospital stay (4.52 days vs. 6.06 days, p = 0.85). Robotic procedures had a lower rate of conversion (3% vs. 8%, p = 0.29) and a lower prevalence of morbidity (19% vs. 26%, p = 0.26).

This systematic review aims to describe pathogens studied using MBAs, the operational implementation of MBAs, and how the data generated were synthesised. In November and December 2023, four databases were searched for studies utilising MBAs for the integrated serosurveillance of infectious diseases. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data regarding the study settings and population, methodology, seroprevalence results, and operational implementation elements. Overall, 4765 studies were identified; 47 were eligible for inclusion, of which 41% (n = 19) investigated multiple malaria species, and 14% performed concurrent surveillance of malaria in combination with other infectious diseases (n = 14). Additionally, 14 studies (29%) investigated a combination of multiple infectious diseases (other than malaria), and seven studies examined a combination of vaccine-preventable diseases. Haiti (n = 8) was the most studied country, followed by Ethiopia (n = 6), Bangladesh (n = 3), Kenya (n = 3), and Tanzania (n = 3). Only seven studies were found where integrated serosurveillance was the primary objective. The synthesis of data varied and included the investigation of age-specific seroprevalence (n = 25), risk factor analysis (n = 15), and spatial analysis of disease prevalence (n = 8). This review demonstrated that the use of MBAs for integrated surveillance of multiple pathogens is gaining traction; however, more research and capabilities in lower- and middle-income countries are needed to optimise and standardise sample collection, survey implementation, and the analysis and interpretation of results. Geographical and population seroprevalence data can enable targeted public health interventions, highlighting the potential and importance of integrated serological surveillance as a public health tool.",,"IgG antibody seroprevalence,malaria,neglected tropical diseases,public health,serological surveillance,vaccine-preventable diseases,vector-borne diseases",10.3390/tropicalmed10010019,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed10010019

Probiotics have been found to provide several benefits to hosts via modulation of the gut microbiota and their metabolites. However, till now, no conventional probiotics have been clearly proven to be an effective prophylactic option for CDI prevention. Therefore, more studies on developing specific probiotic candidates targeting CDI and improving diversity of probiotics administrated are needed. In this study, a human-origin highly diverse and highly targeted probiotic cocktail (Pro11) containing 11 various probiotic species was developed against C. difficile. Pro11 protected mice against CDI with lower clinical scores and higher survival rates, and inhibited C. difficile in vivo with less C. difficile burden and toxins production determined in colon. Histological analysis demonstrated that Pro11 strengthened gut barrier, reducing gut permeability (less secreted sCD14 in serum) and gut inflammation. In addition, gut microbiome analysis demonstrated that Pro11 increased gut microbiome diversity and beneficial species. Along with gut microbiome modulation, gut metabolites including butyrate, were significantly increased in the probiotics-fed group. Results from this study highlighted probiotics as a promising CDI therapy as gut microbiota modulators, which will lay the foundation for translating probiotics in mitigating CDI and other intestinal pathogens for clinical use.",,"Clostridioides difficile,gut metabolites,gut microbiome,hospital-associated diarrhea,probiotics",10.3389/fmicb.2025.1555220,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1555220

In addition to neurobehavioral symptoms, children with ASD often have gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. constipation, diarrhea, gas, abdominal pain, reflux). Several studies have proposed the role of gut microbiota and metabolic disorders in gastrointestinal symptoms and neurodevelopmental dysfunction in ASD patients; these results offer promising avenues for novel treatments of this disorder. Interventions targeting the gut microbiota–such as fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), microbiota transplant therapy (MTT), probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, antifungals, and diet–promise to improve gut health and can potentially improve neurological symptoms. The modulation of the gut microbiota using MTT in ASD has shown beneficial and long-term effects on GI symptoms and core symptoms of autism. Also, the modulation of the gut microbiota to resemble that of typically developing individuals seems to be the most promising intervention. As most of the studies carried out with MTT are open-label studies, more extensive double-blinded randomized control trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of MTT as a therapeutic option for ASD. This review examines the current clinical research evidence for the use of interventions that target the microbiome–such as antibiotics, antifungals, probiotics/prebiotics, synbiotics, and MTT–and their effectiveness in changing the gut microbiota and improving gastrointestinal and neurobehavioral symptoms in ASD.",,"ASD,Autism,fecal microbiota transplant,FMT,gut microbiome,microbiota transplant therapy,MTT,prebiotics,probiotics,synbiotics",10.1080/19490976.2025.2499580,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2025.2499580

As understanding of viral transmission improves, infection prevention and control (IPC) policies need to be updated. Aim: To compare the effectiveness of soap and water alone to bleach-based cleaners in eliminating SARS-CoV-2 infection in households and community settings. Setting: We conducted a virtual search through the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane database of systematic reviews, PubMed, EMBASE, and Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC). Methods: We assessed studies which compared the effect of soap and water cleaning on SARS-CoV-2 among humans to that of bleach-based cleaning, both in households and communities. We prioritised systematic reviews and randomised studies and only included other study designs, such as laboratory studies, which had interventions of relevant interest. Results: We retrieved 1192 articles from the search. We summarised evidence from three laboratory studies as there were no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or comparative effectiveness studies that met our inclusion criteria. Indirect evidence suggests that soap and bleach-based cleaners were effective at different concentrations. Substantial heterogeneity between the cited studies precludes any inference on effectiveness in reducing risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Both interventions remain important components of IPC measures. Conclusion: There was no evidence for comparison of soap and water versus bleach-based cleaners against SARS-CoV-2 in humans in household and community settings. Indirect evidence shows both interventions to be effective against the virus.

A systematic review of fluralaner as a treatment for ectoparasitic infections in mammalian species,,"Jiang Y., Old J.M.",3/18/25,3/21/25,PeerJ (2025) 13:3 Article Number: e18882. Date of Publication: 2025,PeerJ,2025,13,3,,,2025,Review,2167-8359 (electronic),"Fluralaner (Bravecto(TM)) is a novel isoxazoline ectoparasiticide used for controlling ectoparasites of domestic mammals and is increasingly being used on wildlife. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety of fluralaner on mammals given its increasing use. The search was performed in GoogleScholar and the SciFinder databases using the terms ‘fluralaner’ and ‘Bravecto(TM)’, and was concluded on 30th August, 2024. A total of 250 references were initially saved and reduced to 121 peer-reviewed journal articles using PRISMA guidelines, based on the removal of duplicates, those published in low quality journals (ranked less than Q2), and limiting publications to clinical trials. Articles were then categorised and ranked using the level of evidence, Cochrane ‘risk of bias’ assessment tool, methodological quality, and study size. Overall, the efficacy of fluralaner has been assessed on 14 mammalian species, and pharmacokinetic investigations conducted on 15. Fluralaner was mostly effective at treating some ectoparasites on captive individuals when there was little chance of re-infection; however, it did not prevent bites from blood-sucking ectoparasites and could not prevent blood-borne pathogen transfer to host animals. Very few studies have investigated the pharmacokinetics of fluralaner, and hence were difficult to compare; however, wombats differed greatly from their eutherian counterparts in their C(max) and t½ values and require further investigation. Overall, fluralaner was deemed moderately safe; however, most studies were classified as fair in terms of quality and most studies were based on small or very small sample numbers. Nineteen studies reported side effects, one of which included signs of severe neurological toxicity, with most of the articles not reporting on safety either positively or negatively. Concerns were raised regarding the extended time fluralaner was detected in faeces and subsequently environmental contamination is a concern.

The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy for each antibiotic. Methods: Only randomized clinical trials of patients being treated for Clostridioides disease infection were included. Studies were sought in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization clinical trials register portal (up to December 9, 2022). Sustained clinical cure was the outcome of treatment comparison, defined as the resolution of diarrhea without recurrence. Vancomycin was the standard treatment comparator. Meta-analysis was performed for each antibiotic. The overall certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE)—classified as either high, moderate, low, or very low. Results: Fourteen eligible studies were included in the meta-analysis with 4837 patients from 773 sites. Cadazolid did not increase sustained clinical cure relative to vancomycin (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.96–1.13; moderate-certainty evidence). Fidaxomicin demonstrated a significant increase (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07–1.21; low-certainty evidence). In one phase 2 study, ridinilazole demonstrated a significant increase in sustained clinical cure (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01–2.91; very low-quality evidence). Surotomycin did not show significant improvement (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96–1.14; moderate-certainty evidence).

Along the lines of these advances, both public awareness and acceptance of probiotics are increasing. That’s why; academic and industrial research is dedicated to identifying and investigating new microbial strains for the development of next-generation probiotics (NGPs). At this time, there is a growing interest in NGPs as biotherapeutics that alter the gut microbiome and affect various diseases development. In this work, we have focused on some emergent and promising NGPs, specifically Eubacterium hallii, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia spp., Akkermansia muciniphila, and Bacteroides fragilis, as their presence in the gut can have an impact on the development of various diseases. Emerging studies point out the beneficial roles of these NGPs and open up novel promising therapeutic options. Interestingly, these NGPs were found to enhance gastrointestinal immunity, enhance immunotherapy efficacy in cancer patients, retain the intestinal barrier integrity, generate valuable metabolites, especially short-chain fatty acids, and decrease complications of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although many of these NGPs are considered promising for the prevention and treatment of several chronic diseases, research on humans is still lacking. Therefore, approval of these microbes from regulatory agencies is rare. Besides, some issues limit their wide use in the market, such as suitable methods for the culture and storage of these oxygen-sensitive microbes. The present review goes over the main points related to NGPs and gives a viewpoint on the key issues that still hinder their wide application. Furthermore, we have focused on the advancement in NGPs and human healthiness investigations by clarifying the limitations of traditional probiotic microorganisms, discussing the characteristics of emerging NGPs and defining their role in the management of certain ailments.

The most common DGBI are irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional constipation (FC) and functional dyspepsia (FD). Recently, a deep understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in these diseases was possible due to multi-omics methods capable to provide a comprehensive assessment. Most of the therapies recommended for these patients, can modulate the gut microbiota such as diet, prebiotics, probiotics and non-absorbable antibiotics, which were shown to be safe and effective. Since patients complain symptoms after food ingestion, diet represents the first line therapeutic approach. Avoiding dietary fat and fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, and increasing the number of soluble fibers represent the therapeutic choices for FD, IBS and FC respectively. Probiotics, as a category, have been employed with good results in all the abovementioned DGBI. Rifaximin has been shown to be useful in the context of bowel related disorders, although a recent trial showed positive results for FD.

Infection prevention and control (IPC) measures include the clinical best practices (CBP) of hand hygiene, hygiene and sanitation, screening, and basic and additional precautions. Few studies demonstrate their cost-effectiveness in LTCF, and those that do, largely focus on one CBP. An overarching synthesis of IPC economic analyses in this context is warranted. The aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic review of economic evaluations of CBP applied in LTCF. Methods: We twice queried CINAHL, Cochrane, EconLit, Embase, Medline, Web of Science and Scopus for studies published in the last three decades of economic evaluations of CBP in LTCF. We included controlled and randomized clinical trials, cohort, longitudinal, follow-up, prospective, retrospective, cross-sectional, and simulations studies, as well as those based on mathematical or statistical modelling. Two reviewers conducted study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment of studies. We applied discounting rates of 3%, 5% and 8%, and presented all costs in 2022 Canadian dollars. The protocol of this review was registered with Research Registry (reviewregistry1210) and published in BMC Systematic Reviews. Findings: We found 3,331 records and then 822 records; ten studies were retained. The economic analyses described were cost-minimization (n = 1), cost-benefit (n = 1), cost-savings (n = 2), cost-utility (n = 2) and cost-effectiveness which included cost-utility and cost-benefit analyses (n = 4). Four studies were high quality, three were moderate, and three were low quality. Inter-rater agreement for quality assessment was 91⋅7%. All studies (n = 10) demonstrated that CBP associated with IPC are clinically effective in LTCF and many (n = 6) demonstrated their cost effectiveness.

Recent studies showed that polymicrobial biofilm formation represents a significant pathogenic mechanism in recurrent and chronic forms of OM. Biofilm enables bacteria to resist antibiotics that would typically be recommended in guidelines, contributing to the ineffectiveness of current antimicrobial strategies. Given the challenges of successfully treating bacterial biofilms, there is an growing interest in identifying novel and effective compounds to overcome antibacterial resistance. The objective of this review was to provide an overview of the novel compounds with antibiofilm effects on bacterial biofilm formed by clinical isolates of OM. The systematic review included studies that evaluated antibiofilm effect of novel natural or synthetic compounds on bacterial biofilm formed from clinical isolates obtained from patients with OM. The eligibility criteria were defined using the PICOS system: (P) Population: all human patients with bacterial OM; (I) Intervention: novel natural or synthetic compound with biofilm effect; (C) Control standard therapeutic antimicrobial agents or untreated biofilms, (O) Outcome: antibiofilm effect (biofilm inhibition, biofilm eradication), (S) Study design. The PRISMA protocol for systematic reviews and meta-analysis was followed. From 3564 potentially eligible studies, 1817 duplicates were removed, and 1705 were excluded according to defined exclusion criteria. A total of 41 studies with available full texts were retrieved by two independent authors. Fifteen articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review which included 125 patients with OM. A total of 17 different novel compounds were examined, including N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), tea tree oil, xylitol, eugenol, Aloe barbadensis, Zingiber officinale, Curcuma longa, Acacia arabica, antisense peptide nucleic acids, probiotics Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus oralis, Sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNA), bioactive glass, green synthesized copper oxide nanoparticles, radish, silver nanoparticles and acetic acid. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly studied pathogen, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. Biofilm inhibition only by an examined compound was assessed in six studies; biofilm eradication in four studies, and both biofilm inhibition and biofilm eradication were examined in five studies. This systematic review indicates that some compounds like NAC, prebiotics, nanoparticles and MESNA that have significant effects on biofilm are safe and could be researched more extensively for further clinical use.

Of the 240000 randomized, 38792 who were unreachable and 48705 who did not receive an invitation were excluded. Of those invited, screening participation rates were 49.6% (31497/63508) for HPSA + FIT and 35.7% (31777/88995) for FIT alone. Among 12142 participants (38.5%) with positive HPSA results, 8664 (71.4%) received antibiotic treatment, and eradication occurred in 91.9%. Gastric cancer incidence rates were 0.032% in the HPSA + FIT group and 0.037% in the FIT-alone group (mean difference, -0.005% [95% CI, -0.013% to 0.003%]; P =.23). Gastric cancer mortality rates were 0.015% in the HPSA + FIT group and 0.013% in the FIT-alone group (mean difference, 0.002% [95% CI, -0.004% to 0.007%]; P =.57). After adjusting for differences in screening participation, length of follow-up, and patient characteristics in post hoc analyses, an invitation for HPSA + FIT was associated with lower rates of gastric cancer (0.79 [95% CI, 0.63-0.98]) but not with gastric cancer mortality (1.02 [95% CI, 0.73-1.40]), compared with FIT alone. Among participants who received antibiotics, the most common adverse effects were abdominal pain or diarrhea (2.1%) and dyspepsia or poor appetite (0.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among residents of Taiwan, an invitation to test for HPSA combined with FIT did not reduce rates of gastric cancer or gastric cancer mortality, compared with an invitation for FIT alone. However, when differences in screening participation and length of follow-up were accounted for, gastric cancer incidence, but not gastric cancer mortality, was lower in the HSPA + FIT group, compared with FIT alone.

Its lesions are present as scaly erythema or plaques. Disruptions in the body's immune system play a significant role in developing psoriasis. Recent evidence suggests a potential role of the gut microbiome in autoimmune diseases. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the primary metabolites created by gut microbes and play a crucial fuction in autoimmunity. SCFAs act on various cells by mediating signaling to participate in host physiological and pathological processes. These processes encompass body metabolism, maintenance of intestinal barrier function, and immune system modulation. SCFAs can regulate immune cells to enhance the body's immune function, potentially influencing the prevention and treatment of psoriasis. However, the mechanisms underlying the role of SCFAs in psoriasis remain incompletely understood. This paper examines the relationship between SCFAs and psoriasis, elucidating how SCFAs influence the immune system, inflammatory response, and gut barrier in psoriasis. According to the study, in psoriasis, SCFAs have been shown to regulate neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells in the adaptive immune system, as well as T and B cells in the innate immune system. Additionally, we explore the role of SCFAs in psoriasis by maintaining intestinal barrier function, restoring intestinal ecological homeostasis, and investigating the potential therapeutic benefits of SCFAs for psoriasis.",,"Immunity,Inflammation,Intestinal barrier,Psoriasis,SCFAs",10.1016/j.intimp.2024.112928,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2024.112928

Despite decades of research efforts, a specific treatment is currently lacking, and preventive strategies are the mainstays of care. This review aims to help understand the complex interplay between gut microbiota and their metabolites in NEC pathogenesis. In particular, we focused on how these factors can influence gut health, immune responses, and intestinal barrier integrity. Discussion: Current research has increasingly focused on the role of the gut microbiota and their metabolites in NEC pathogenesis, thanks to their involvement in modulating gut health, immune responses, and intestinal barrier integrity. Conclusions: A deeper understanding of the interplay between gut microbiota and their metabolites is essential for developing personalized strategies to prevent NEC.

The review elucidates the diversity and development of the human GM, highlighting its pivotal functions in host physiology, including nutrient absorption, immune regulation, and energy metabolism. Studies show that GM dysbiosis is linked to increased energy extraction, altered metabolic pathways, and inflammation, contributing to obesity, MS, and T2D. The interplay between dietary habits and GM composition is explored, underscoring the influence of diet on microbial diversity and metabolic functions.

Interventions for preventing the progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease,,"St Pierre K., Cashmore B.A., Bolignano D., Zoccali C., Ruospo M., Craig J.C., Strippoli G.F.M., Mallett A.J., Green S.C., Tunnicliffe D.J.",10/9/24,10/11/24,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024) 2024:10 Article Number: CD010294. Date of Publication: 2 Oct 2024,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2024,2024,10,,,2-Oct-24,Review,1465-1858,"Background: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the leading inherited cause of kidney disease. Clinical management has historically focused on symptom control and reducing associated complications. Improved understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in kidney cyst growth and disease progression has resulted in new pharmaceutical agents targeting disease pathogenesis and preventing disease progression. However, the role of disease-modifying agents for all people with ADPKD is unclear. This is an update of a review first published in 2015. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions to prevent the progression of ADPKD and the safety based on patient-important endpoints, defined by the Standardised Outcomes in NephroloGy-Polycystic Kidney Disease (SONG-PKD) core outcome set, and general and specific adverse effects. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplants Register of Studies up to 13 August 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any interventions for preventing the progression of ADPKD with other interventions, placebo, or standard care were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed study risks of bias and extracted data. Summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Main results: We included 57 studies (8016 participants) that investigated 18 pharmacological interventions (vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R) antagonists, antihypertensive therapy, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, somatostatin analogues, antiplatelet agents, eicosapentaenoic acids, statins, kinase inhibitors, diuretics, anti-diabetic agents, water intake, dietary intervention, and supplements) in this review. Compared to placebo, the V2R antagonist tolvaptan probably preserves eGFR (3 studies, 2758 participants: MD 1.26 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 95% CI 0.73 to 1.78; I(2) = 0%) and probably slows total kidney volume (TKV) growth in adults (1 study, 1307 participants: MD -2.70 mL/cm, 95% CI -3.24 to -2.16) (moderate certainty evidence). However, there was insufficient evidence to determine tolvaptan’s impact on kidney failure and death. There may be no difference in serious adverse events; however, treatment probably increases nocturia, fatigue and liver enzymes, may increase dry mouth and thirst, and may decrease hypertension and urinary and upper respiratory tract infections. Data on the impact of other therapeutic interventions were largely inconclusive. Compared to placebo, somatostatin analogues probably decrease TKV (6 studies, 500 participants: SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.16; I(2) = 11%), probably have little or no effect on eGFR (4 studies, 180 participants: MD 4.11 mL/min/1.73 m(3), 95% CI -3.19 to 11.41; I(2) = 0%) (moderate certainty evidence), and may have little or no effect on kidney failure (2 studies, 405 participants: RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.49; I(2) = 39%; low certainty evidence). Serious adverse events may increase (2 studies, 405 participants: RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.25; low certainty evidence). Somatostatin analogues probably increase alopecia, diarrhoea or abnormal faeces, dizziness and fatigue but may have little or no effect on anaemia or infection. The effect on death is unclear. Targeted low blood pressure probably results in a smaller per cent annual increase in TKV (1 study, 558 participants: MD -1.00, 95% CI -1.67 to -0.33; moderate certainty evidence) compared to standard blood pressure targets, had uncertain effects on death, but probably do not impact other outcomes such as change in eGFR or adverse events. Kidney failure was not reported. Data comparing antihypertensive agents, mTOR inhibitors, eicosapentaenoic acids, statins, vitamin D compounds, metformin, trichlormethiazide, spironolactone, bosutinib, curcumin, niacinamide, prescribed water intake and antiplatelet agents were sparse and inconclusive. An additional 23 ongoing studies were also identified, including larger phase III RCTs, which will be assessed in a future update of this review. Authors' conclusions: Although many interventions have been investigated in patients with ADPKD, at present, there is little evidence that they improve patient outcomes. Tolvaptan is the only therapeutic intervention that has demonstrated the ability to slow disease progression, as assessed by eGFR and TKV change. However, it has not demonstrated benefits for death or kidney failure. In order to confirm the role of other therapeutic interventions in ADPKD management, large RCTs focused on patient-centred outcomes are needed. The search identified 23 ongoing studies, which may provide more insight into the role of specific interventions.",,,10.1002/14651858.CD010294.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010294.pub3

VS-505 (AP301), an acacia and ferric oxyhydroxide polymer, is a novel fiber-iron-based phosphate binder. This two-part Phase 2 study evaluated the tolerability, safety and efficacy of oral VS-505 administered three times daily with meals in treating hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). Methods. In Part 1, patients received dose-escalated treatment with VS-505 2.25, 4.50 and 9.00 g/day for 2 weeks each, guided by serum phosphorus levels. In Part 2, patients received randomized, open-label, fixed-dosage treatment with VS-505 (1.50, 2.25, 4.50 or 6.75 g/day) or sevelamer carbonate 4.80 g/day for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in serum phosphorus. Results. The study enrolled 158 patients (Part 1: 25; Part 2: 133), with 130 exposed to VS-505 in total. VS-505 was well tolerated. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders, mainly feces discolored (56%) and diarrhea (15%; generally during Weeks 1–2 of treatment). Most gastrointestinal disorders resolved without intervention, and none was serious. In Part 1, serum phosphorus significantly improved (mean change −2.0 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval −2.7, −1.4) after VS-505 dose escalation. In Part 2, serum phosphorus significantly and dose-dependently improved in all VS-505 arms, with clinically meaningful reductions with VS-505 4.50 and 6.75 g/day, and sevelamer carbonate 4.80 g/day [mean change −1.6 (−2.2, −1.0), −1.8 (−2.4, −1.2) and −1.4 (−2.2, −0.5) mg/dL, respectively]. In both parts, serum phosphorus reductions occurred within 1 week of VS-505 initiation, returning to baseline within 2 weeks of VS-505 discontinuation. Conclusion. VS-505, a novel phosphate binder, was well tolerated with a manageable safety profile, and effectively and dose-dependently reduced serum phosphorus in CKD patients with hyperphosphatemia receiving MHD.",,"clinical study,hemodialysis,hyperphosphatemia,phosphate binder,VS-505",10.1093/ndt/gfae053,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfae053

Objectives: To review the published literature to determine which tendon sheaths are commonly affected by non-septic tenosynovitis and to describe the most frequently reported pathological lesions, outcomes, and surgical complications in equine non-septic tenosynovitis. Study design: Systematic review. Methods: Literature searches were conducted in July 2021 from the online search engines PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science Core, VetMed Resource and ProQuest Theses & Dissertations. The inclusion criteria followed a participants, interventions, comparisons, outcome and study design (PICOS) approach. For inclusion, studies had to include live equids with non-septic tenosynovitis of any tendon sheath. Studies were excluded if they only described non-equine species, if they included data only on non-tendon sheath structures, or if they included data exclusively on cases of septic or contaminated tendon sheaths. Determination of non-sepsis relied on the diagnosis of the original authors; however, if non-sepsis was not explicitly specified, then cases that had a history of contamination of the sheath, a wound near the sheath or a positive bacterial culture were excluded from analysis. Data analysed included the distribution of structures affected by non-septic tenosynovitis, the most common pathological lesions identified within each sheath, and the most frequently reported surgical complications of non-septic tenosynovitis. The quality of each study was assessed using a methodological quality analysis. Results: A total of 85 studies describing non-septic tenosynovitis in the horse were included. Across all 85 studies, there were a total of 2449 tendon sheaths in 2101 horses reported to be affected by non-septic tenosynovitis. The digital flexor sheath was the most reported structure to be diagnosed with non-septic tenosynovitis: 41/85 (48%) studies examined the digital flexor sheath exclusively, followed by the carpal flexor sheath, tarsal flexor sheath, carpal extensor sheaths, tarsal extensor sheaths, and one case of biceps brachii non-septic tenosynovitis. For most tendon sheaths, the most common pathological lesion was an intrathecal tear of a soft tissue structure, including tears of the deep digital flexor tendon and tears of the manica flexoria. Bilateral disease was most common in the carpal flexor sheath, where distal radial physeal exostoses were the most common pathological lesions. Less common causes of non-septic tenosynovitis included neoplasia, fracture of a bone adjacent to a tendon sheath, and mineralisation of an intrathecal tendon. The likelihood of return to previous level of athletic function following non-septic tenosynovitis of most structures was approximately 50%, and the most common complication was persistent effusion following tenoscopy. While iatrogenic infection following surgery was uncommon, it was most likely following tenoscopy of the digital flexor sheath. Conclusion: Non-septic tenosynovitis is commonly reported in equine athletes, with intra-thecal tears of the deep digital flexor tendon, superficial digital flexor tendon and manica flexoria frequently reported. Directions for future research include more thorough assessment of and reporting of complications following non-septic tenosynovitis and correlation of characteristics of intrathecal pathological lesions with clinical outcomes.",,"adhesions,aseptic,digital flexor tendon sheath,horse,ligament,manica flexoria,tendon,tenoscopy",10.1111/evj.14000,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/evj.14000

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate current evidence of the effect of GB consumption as a complement to standard treatment in the population with acute or persistent diarrhea. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and LILACS from inception to January 2024; there was no language restriction. Only randomized controlled trials using GB as an intervention were included, and studies using antidiarrheal medication were excluded. A meta-analysis was performed to compare the effect of GB on the resolution of acute and persistent diarrhea. To measure the certainty of evidence, the GRADE assessment was used. Nine randomized controlled trials (seven open and two blinded) were included. Studies were conducted in the pediatric population comprising a total of 3996 patients aged 8 to 34 months, eight studies were written in English and one in Spanish. GB-based food consumption significantly increased the hazard of resolution of diarrhea compared to standard treatment (HR 1.96, 95% CI [1.62; 2.37], p < 0.01; I(2) = 52%). The subgroup analysis showed a higher hazard of resolution of diarrhea for children with persistent diarrhea (HR 2.34, 95% CI [1.78; 3.08] compared to acute diarrhea (HR 1.74, 95% CI [1.45; 2.09]). Conclusions: The use of green banana-based foods as a complement to standard treatment in children is probably associated with a faster resolution in acute diarrhea and may aid in the treatment of persistent diarrhea. More clinical trials are necessary to assess if a synergistic effect between GB and other foods exists and proves to be better than GB alone.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of licorice formulations, alone or in combination with other herbs, on liver function enzymes in patients with primary liver disease. We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to April 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of Glycyrrhiza spp. preparations versus placebo or standard of care controls were included. Standard Cochrane methods were used to extract data and appraise eligible studies. A total of 15 RCTs, involving 1367 participants, were included in the analysis. The studies varied widely in geographical location, duration, and licorice preparations used. Licorice significantly reduced alanine aminotransferase (ALT) by 15.63 U/L (95% CI: −25.08, −6.18; p = 0.001) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) by 7.37 U/L (95% CI: −13.13, −1.61; p = 0.01) compared to control groups. Subgroup analyses revealed that purified glycyrrhizic acid compounds were particularly effective, showing greater reductions in ALT and AST without significant heterogeneity. Although licorice treatment did not significantly impact gamma-glutamyl transferase and total bilirubin (TBIL) levels overall, specific licorice-herb preparations did show a notable reduction in TBIL. The safety profile of licorice was consistent with known side effects, predominantly mild and related to its mineralocorticoid effects. Despite heterogeneity and potential language bias, the findings suggest that licorice can enhance liver function.

Surgery, particularly in the form of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA), is indicated in cases of refractory/severe disease. IPAA can lead to acute complications (e.g., acute pouchitis) as well as late complications, including chronic inflammatory disorders of the pouch. Chronic pouchitis, including the antibiotic-dependent (CADP) and antibiotic-refractory (CARP) forms, represents a significant and current therapeutic challenge due to the substantial need for evidence regarding viable treatment options. Biological therapies have shown promising results, with infliximab, adalimumab, ustekinumab, and vedolizumab demonstrating some efficacy in chronic pouchitis; however, robust randomized clinical trials are only available for vedolizumab. This narrative review focuses on the evidence concerning small molecules in chronic pouchitis, specifically Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1P-R) modulators.

Liujunzi decoction (LJZD), a traditional Chinese medicine classic formula, widely employed for gastroesophageal reflux disease in Asia, lacks sufficient evidence-based support for its clinical efficacy. Therefore, this study compared the safety and efficacy of LJZD and proton pump inhibitors for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux using meta analysis. Methods: A comprehensive search of online databases for published clinical trials was carried out up to February 2024. The research selection, gathering of data, quality evaluation, and data analysis techniques were all guided by Cochrane guidelines. Key outcome measures comprised the total clinical response rate (TCE), recurrence rate, frequency scale for the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and gastrointestinal symptom rating scale. Results: Nineteen randomised controlled trials involving 1 941 patients were incorporated into this systematic review and meta analysis. Liujunzi decoction exhibited significantly superior overall efficacy compared to the proton pump inhibitors group, with a higher TCE (OR = 4.04, 95% CI 2.79–5.84, P < 0.001). Treatment with LJZD reduced recurrence rates, and no notable distinctions were observed in frequency scale for the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease and gastrointestinal symptom rating scale. Combining LJZD with Western medicine notably ameliorated gastroesophageal reflux symptoms compared to Western medicine alone. Conclusions: Liujunzi decoction, whether used alone or in combination with Western medicine, is a safe and effective treatment for Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GRED).",,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease,Liujunzi decoction,Meta analysis,Rikkunshito,Traditional Chinese Medicine",10.1016/j.hermed.2024.100918,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hermed.2024.100918

The emerging focus on the gut microbiota's role in CKD pathophysiology represents a pivotal area in nephrology; however, the evidence on this topic is limited. This observational prospective study, in the framework of the PREDIMED-Plus trial, investigates associations between gut microbiota composition and the 1-year trajectory of CKD in 343 participants aged 55–75 years with high cardiovascular risk. Materials and methods: Kidney function was assessed at baseline and at 1-year of follow-up through the estimated glomerular filtration rate based on cystatin C (eGFR-CysC) and CKD defined by eGFR-CysC <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Participants were grouped based on their 1-year CKD trajectory: Group 1 maintained normal status or improved from CKD to normal, while Group 2 maintained CKD or worsened from normal to CKD. Fecal microbiota composition was assessed through 16S sequencing. Key findings: We observed differences in gut microbiota composition between CKD trajectory groups. Notably, the baseline relative abundance of Lachnoclostridium and Lachnospira, both butyrate-producing genera, was lower in participants maintaining or progressing to CKD. Longitudinally, a decrease in Lachnospira abundance was associated with CKD progression. The improved Chao1 index after 1-year follow-up suggests a link between enhanced microbial richness and stable/better kidney function. Significance: The findings underscore the potential of gut microbiota analysis in non-invasively monitoring CKD, especially in older populations, and hint at future interventions targeting gut microbiota to manage CKD progression.

It is a neurological disorder due to hepatic insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunts. Its clinical presentation includes neuropsychiatric dysfunction ranging from subclinical changes to comatose state. It is a sign of poor prognosis in cirrhotics with a high 1-year mortality. Each episode of hepatic encephalopathy leads to high hospitalization rate, poor prognosis and raised burden of healthcare. Primary prophylaxis is prevention of initial occurrence and secondary prophylaxis is prevention of reappearance of hepatic encephalopathy in subjects who had prior history. Early detection and management of triggers is very important in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. The initial choice of treatment is still lactulose, as it is effective in minimal, overt, and recurrent hepatic encephalopathy. Rifaximin is equally effective as lactulose in managing hepatic encephalopathy and is better tolerated. Branch chain amino acids are beneficial in subjects who are protein intolerant. L-ornithine L-aspartate and probiotics are also useful in the management of hepatic encephalopathy. Rifaximin along with lactulose is effective in managing overt and recurrent hepatic encephalopathy. Large portosystemic shunts embolization and liver transplant is efficacious in certain group of patients.

Typical symptoms include straining during defaecation, rectal bleeding, tenesmus, mucoid secretion, anal pain and a sense of incomplete evacuation. Diagnosis is based on characteristic clinical symptoms and endoscopic/histological findings. Several treatments have been reported in the literature with variable ulcer healing rates. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different treatments for SRUS. Materials and methods: A systematic review and network meta-analysis were performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Studies in English, French and Spanish languages were included. Papers written in other languages were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were reviews, case reports or clinical series enrolling less than five patients, study duplications, no clinical data of interest and no article available. A systematic literature search was conducted from January 2000 to March 2024 using the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The biases of the studies were assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale or the Jadad scale when appropriate. Types of treatment and their efficacy for the cure of SRUS were collected and critically assessed. The study's primary outcome was to estimate the rate of patients with ulcer healing. Results: A total of 22 studies with 911 patients (men 361, women 550) diagnosed with SRUS were analysed in the final meta-analysis. The pooled effect estimates of treatment efficacy revealed that surgery showed the highest ulcer healing rate (70.5%; 95% CI 0.57–0.83). Surgery was superior in the cure of ulcers with respect to medical therapies and biofeedback (OR 0.09 and OR 0.14). Conclusion: Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is a challenging clinical entity to manage. Proficient results have been reported with the surgical approach, suggesting its positive role in cases refractory to medical and biofeedback therapy.

Aspiration pneumonia is one of the most cases of pneumonia developing among older people. As aspiration pneumonia may develop as a result of age-related deterioration, it is crucial to consider it as an unavoidable event with aging. While pneumonia is diagnosed based on respiratory symptoms and radiological features, the lung involvement of aspiration pneumonia may be undetectable via a frontal chest radiograph in some cases. Bacterial profiles show the predominance of drug-resistant bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), but isolated bacteria from respiratory samples do not necessarily indicate causative pathogens. Furthermore, there is no evidence regarding treatment superiority using broad-spectrum antibiotics compared with narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Even if isolated pathogens are a causative factor for pneumonia among older patients, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics covering the bacteria may not improve their outcomes. Therefore, we propose a treatment strategy independent of the risk of drug resistance focusing on the discrimination of patients who are unlikely to respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics. An aspiration risk is associated with increased in-hospital mortality in patients with pneumonia, which could also lead to a greater risk of poor long-term outcomes with increased 1-year mortality. Advance care planning is now recognized as a process for communication and medical decision-making across the life course. This approach would be widely recommended for older people with aspiration risk.",,"Advance care planning,Aspiration pneumonia,Healthcare-associated pneumonia",10.1016/j.resinv.2024.05.016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resinv.2024.05.016

However, intraoperative identification of proper perfusion remains a challeng. This review synthesizes findings from the literature spanning from January 2010 to March 2024, sourced from Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, and other databases, to evaluate the role of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging in enhancing surgical outcomes. Specifically, it explores the use of ICG in surgeries related to Hirschsprung disease, anorectal malformations, cloacal reconstructions, vaginal agenesis, bladder augmentation, and the construction of antegrade continence channels. Preliminary evidence suggests that ICG fluorescence significantly aids in intraoperative decision-making by improving the visualization of vascular networks and assessing tissue perfusion. Despite the limited number of studies, initial findings indicate that ICG may offer advantages over traditional clinical assessments for intestinal perfusion. Its application has demonstrated a promising safety profile in pediatric patients, underscoring the need for larger, prospective studies to validate these observations, quantify benefits, and further assess its impact on clinical outcomes.

Methods. A systematic review was conducted, encompassing English-language articles published before January 2024, sourced from the Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. This review included observational studies that reported the occurrence of reactive arthritis (ReA) among patients with Campylobacter, Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella, or Yersinia infections. Data extraction was carried out independently by two reviewers. Subsequently, a random-effects meta-analysis was performed, with heterogeneity assessed using the I(2) value. Additionally, meta-regression was employed to investigate the potential influence of study-level variables on the observed heterogeneity. Results.

It has been hypothesised that poor 'Western-style' dietary patterns select for a microbiota that drives IBD inflammation and, that through dietary intervention, a healthy microbiota may be restored. This study aimed to systematically review the literature and assess current available evidence regarding the influence of diet on the intestinal microbiota composition in IBD patients, and how this may affect disease activity. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from January 2013 to June 2023, to identify studies investigating diet and microbiota in IBD. Results: Thirteen primary studies met the inclusion criteria and were selected for narrative synthesis. Reported associations between diet and microbiota in IBD were conflicting due to the considerable degree of heterogeneity between studies. Nine intervention studies trialled specific diets and did not demonstrate significant shifts in the diversity and abundance of intestinal microbial communities or improvement in disease outcomes. The remaining four cross-sectional studies did not find a specific microbial signature associated with habitual dietary patterns in IBD patients. Conclusions: Diet modulates the gut microbiota, and this may have implications for IBD; however, the body of evidence does not currently support clear dietary patterns or food constituents that are associated with a specific microbiota profile or disease marker in IBD patients.

Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of etrolizumab for induction and maintenance of remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Methods: We searched the following databases: PUBMED, Web of Science, OVID, and SCOPUS from inception to January 15. Inclusion criteria were any phase 2 and 3 clinical trials that compared etrolizumab with a placebo in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, excluding case reports, animal studies, phase 1 trials, and conference abstracts due to duplication. We used RevMan software (5.4) for the meta-analysis. Results: Five clinical trials were included in our meta-analysis. The total number of patients included in the study is 1248 patients, 860 patients in the etrolizumab group and 388 patients in the placebo group. In the induction phase, the pooled analyses showed a statistically significant association between etrolizumab and increased clinical remission, and endoscopic remission compared with placebo (risk ratio [RR] = 2.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.69–4.19, p < 0.0001), and (RR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.52–3.65, p = 0.0001), respectively. In the maintenance phase, the pooled analyses showed a statistically significant association between etrolizumab and increased histologic remission and endoscopic remission (RR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.40–2.98, p = 0.0002) and (RR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.29–2.85, p = 0.001), respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed in adverse events between etrolizumab and placebo in the induction and maintenance phases. Conclusion: Our results show that etrolizumab is an effective and safe drug for the induction and maintenance of clinical remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis patients, as proved by histologic and endoscopic findings.

This review aims to assess the impact of diets high in sustainably sourced proteins on nutrient intake, gut, and age-related health in older adults. A systematic search of the literature was conducted on 5 September 2023 across multiple databases and sources. Studies assessing sustainably sourced protein consumption in community dwelling older adults (≥65 years) were included. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using ‘RoB 2.0′ and ‘ROBINS-E’. Narrative synthesis was performed due to heterogeneity of studies. Twelve studies involving 12,166 older adults were included. Nine studies (n = 10,391) assessed habitual dietary intake and had some RoB concerns, whilst three studies (n = 1812), two with low and one with high RoB, conducted plant-based dietary interventions. Increased adherence to sustainably sourced diets was associated with improved gut microbial factors (n = 4640), healthier food group intake (n = 2142), and increased fibre and vegetable protein intake (n = 1078). Sustainably sourced diets positively impacted on gut microbiota and healthier intake of food groups, although effects on inflammatory outcomes and health status were inconclusive. Future research should focus on dietary interventions combining sustainable proteins and fibre to evaluate gut barrier function and consider inflammatory and body composition outcomes in older adults.",,"gut health,gut microbiota,healthy ageing,plant based diet,sustainable diet,sustainably sourced protein",10.3390/nu16091398,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu16091398

Date of Publication: 1 May 2024,Antibiotics,2024,13,5,,,1-May-24,Review,2079-6382 (electronic),"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an intestinal infection that causes morbidity and mortality and places significant burden and cost on the healthcare system, especially in recurrent cases. Antibiotic overuse is well recognized as the leading cause of CDI in high-risk patients, and studies have demonstrated that even short-term antibiotic exposure can cause a large and persistent disturbance to human colonic microbiota. The recovery and sustainability of the gut microbiome after dysbiosis have been associated with fewer CDI recurrences. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) refers to the procedure in which human donor stool is processed and transplanted to a patient with CDI. It has been historically used in patients with pseudomembranous colitis even before the discovery of Clostridioides difficile. More recent research supports the use of FMT as part of the standard therapy of recurrent CDI. This article will be an in-depth review of five microbiome therapeutic products that are either under investigation or currently commercially available: Rebyota (fecal microbiota, live-jslm, formerly RBX2660), Vowst (fecal microbiota spores, live-brpk, formerly SER109), VE303, CP101, and RBX7455.

Date of Publication: 4 Apr 2024,Annals of Medicine and Surgery,2024,86,5,2836,2847,4-Apr-24,Review,2049-0801 (electronic),"Background/Aim: Probiotics are live microbial supplements that improve the microbial balance in the host animal when administered in adequate amounts. They play an important role in relieving symptoms of many diseases associated with gastrointestinal tract, for example, in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), antibiotic-associated diarrhea, relapsing Clostridium difficile colitis, Helicobacter pylori infections, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this narrative review, the authors aim to evaluate the role of different probiotic formulations in treating gastrointestinal diseases in pediatric population aged 18 years or younger and highlight the main considerations for selecting probiotic formulations for use in this population. Methodology: The authors searched PubMed and Clinicaltrials.gov from inception to 24th July 2022, without any restrictions. Using an iterative process, the authors subsequently added papers through hand-searching citations contained within retrieved articles and relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Results: The effectiveness of single-organism and composite probiotics in treating gastrointestinal disorders in pediatric patients aged 18 or under were analyzed and compared in this study. A total of 39 studies were reviewed and categorized based on positive and negative outcomes, and compared with a placebo, resulting in 25 studies for single-organism and 14 studies for composite probiotics. Gastrointestinal disorders studied included NEC, acute gastroenteritis (AGE), Acute Diarrhea, Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and others. The results show that probiotics are effective in treating various gastrointestinal disorders in children under 18, with single-organism probiotics demonstrating significant positive outcomes in most studies, and composite probiotics showing positive outcomes in all studies analyzed, with a low incidence of negative outcomes for both types. Conclusion: This study concludes that single-organism and composite probiotics are effective complementary therapies for treating gastrointestinal disorders in the pediatric population. Hence, healthcare professionals should consider using probiotics in standard treatment regimens, and educating guardians can enhance the benefits of probiotic therapy. Further research is recommended to identify the optimal strains and dosages for specific conditions and demographics. The integration of probiotics in clinical practice and ongoing research can contribute to reducing the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal disorders in pediatric patients.",,"adolescent,children,gut,microbiome signature,microbiota,synbiotic",10.1097/MS9.0000000000002007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MS9.0000000000002007

A systematic literature search, following PRISMA guidelines, identified 12 original articles that suggest a relationship between GM, the gut–liver axis, and PH. Mechanisms such as dysbiosis, bacterial translocation, altered microbial structure, and inflammation appear to orchestrate this relationship. One notable study highlights the pivotal role of the farnesoid X receptor axis in regulating the interplay between the gut and liver and proposes it as a promising therapeutic target. Fecal transplantation experiments further emphasize the pathogenic significance of the GM in modulating liver maladies, including PH. Recent advancements in metagenomics and metabolomics have expanded our understanding of the GM’s role in human ailments.

The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the available literature on the effectiveness and safety of ADE in critically ill patients, with a focus on special conditions such as anti-fungal therapy and high-risk categories. Although it is widely considered a safe strategy for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS), to date, there has been no assessment of the effect of de-escalation on the development of resistance. Conversely, some authors suggest that prolonged antibiotic treatment may be a side effect of de-escalation, especially in high-risk categories such as neutropenic critically ill patients and intra-abdominal infections (IAIs). Moreover, microbiological documentation is crucial for increasing ADE rates in critically ill patients with infections, and efforts should be focused on exploring new diagnostic tools to accelerate pathogen identification. For these reasons, ADE can be safely used in patients with infections, as confirmed by high-quality and reliable microbiological samplings, although further studies are warranted to clarify its applicability in selected populations.",,"antimicrobial de-escalation,antimicrobial stewardship,critical illness,diagnostic tools,empirical therapy",10.3390/antibiotics13040375,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics13040375

Dietary fiber may alleviate FAPD symptoms; however, whether this effect is sex dependent remains unclear. We investigated the sex dependency of dietary fiber benefit on abdominal pain in children with FAPDs and explored the potential involvement of the gut microbiome. Methods: In 2 cross-sectional cohorts of children with FAPDs (n = 209) and healthy control individuals (n = 105), we correlated dietary fiber intake with abdominal pain symptoms after stratifying by sex. We also performed sex-stratified and sex-interaction analyses on data from a double-blind trial in children with irritable bowel syndrome randomized to psyllium fiber (n = 39) or placebo (n = 49) for 6 weeks. Shotgun metagenomics was used to investigate gut microbiome community changes potentially linking dietary fiber intake with abdominal pain. Results: In the cross-sectional cohorts, fiber intake inversely correlated with pain symptoms in boys (pain episodes: r = –0.24, P = .005; pain days: r = –0.24, P = 0.004) but not in girls. Similarly, in the randomized trial, psyllium fiber reduced the number of pain episodes in boys (P = .012) but not in girls. Generalized linear regression models confirmed that boys treated with psyllium fiber had greater reduction in pain episodes than girls (P = .007 for fiber × sex × time interaction). Age, sexual development, irritable bowel syndrome subtype, stool form, and microbiome composition were not significant determinants in the dietary fiber effects on pain reduction. Conclusions: Dietary fiber preferentially reduces abdominal pain frequency in boys, highlighting the importance of considering sex in future dietary intervention studies for FAPDs.

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in addressing gut dysbiosis associated with COVID-19, as well as their impact on related disease severity and clinical outcomes. Materials and methods: We systematically review 27 studies exploring the efficacy of different microbiome-modulating therapies: probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation as potential interventions for COVID-19. Key findings: The probiotics and synbiotics investigated encompassed a spectrum of eight bacterial and fungal genera, namely Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Pediococcus, Bacillus, Saccharomyces, and Kluyveromyces. Noteworthy prebiotics employed in these studies included chestnut tannin, galactooligosaccharides, fructooligosaccharides, xylooligosaccharide, and resistant dextrin. The majority of the investigated biotics exhibited positive effects on COVID-19 patients, manifesting in symptom alleviation, inflammation reduction, and notable decreases in mortality rates. Five studies reported death rates, showing an average mortality ranging from 0 % to 11 % in the intervention groups, as compared to 3 % to 30 % in the control groups. Specifically, probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics demonstrated efficacy in diminishing the duration and severity of symptoms while significantly accelerating viral and symptomatic remission. FMT emerged as a particularly effective strategy, successfully restoring gut microbiota and ameliorating gastrointestinal disorders.

Prebiotics are a category of food ingredients theorised to have health benefits for the gastrointestinal system through their effect on the growth and activity of intestinal bacteria and probiotics. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of prebiotics for the induction and maintenance of remission in people with active UC. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP on 24 June 2023. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on people with UC. We considered any type of standalone or combination prebiotic intervention, except those prebiotics combined with probiotics (known as synbiotics), compared to any control intervention. We considered interventions of any dose and duration. Data collection and analysis: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. Main results: We included 9 RCTs involving a total of 445 participants. Study duration ranged from 14 days to 2 to 3 months for induction and 1 to 6 months for maintenance of remission. All studies were on adults. Five studies were on people with mild to moderate active disease, three in remission or mild activity, and one did not mention. We judged only one study as at low risk of bias in all areas. Two studies compared prebiotics with placebo for induction of remission.

Authors' conclusions: There may be no difference in occurrence of clinical relapse when adjuvant treatment with prebiotics is compared with adjuvant treatment with placebo for maintenance of remission in UC. Adjuvant treatment with prebiotics may result in more total adverse events when compared to adjuvant treatment with placebo for maintenance of remission. We could draw no conclusions for any of the other outcomes in this comparison due to the very low certainty of the evidence. The evidence for all other comparisons and outcomes was also of very low certainty, precluding any conclusions.

Date of Publication: 14 Mar 2024,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2024,2024,3,,,14-Mar-24,Article,1465-1858,"Background: Leptospirosis is a global zoonotic and waterborne disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. Antibiotics are used as a strategy for prevention of leptospirosis, in particular in travellers and high-risk groups. However, the clinical benefits are unknown, especially when considering possible treatment-associated adverse effects. This review assesses the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in leptospirosis and is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Library (2009, Issue 3). Objectives: To evaluate the benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis for human leptospirosis. Search methods: We identified randomised clinical trials through electronic searches of the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and other resources. We searched online clinical trial registries to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. We checked reference lists of the retrieved studies for further trials. The last date of search was 17 April 2023. Selection criteria: We included ⁠⁠randomised clinical trials of any trial design, assessing antibiotics for prevention of leptospirosis, and with no restrictions on age, sex, occupation, or comorbidity of trial participants. We looked for trials assessing antibiotics irrespective of route of administration, dosage, and schedule versus placebo or no intervention. We also included trials assessing antibiotics versus other antibiotics using these criteria, or the same antibiotic but with another dose or schedule. Data collection and analysis: We followed Cochrane methodology. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis regardless of the presence of an identified clinical syndrome (inclusive of asymptomatic cases), clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis regardless of the presence of laboratory confirmation, clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis confirmed by laboratory diagnosis (exclusive of asymptomatic cases), and serious adverse events. The secondary outcomes were quality of life and the proportion of people with non-serious adverse events. We assessed the risk of bias of the included trials using the RoB 2 tool and the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We presented dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD), with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a random-effects model for our main analyses and the fixed-effect model for sensitivity analyses. Our primary outcome analyses included trial data at the longest follow-up. Main results: We identified five randomised clinical trials comprising 2593 participants that compared antibiotics (doxycycline, azithromycin, or penicillin) with placebo, or one antibiotic compared with another. Four trials assessed doxycycline with different durations, one trial assessed azithromycin, and one trial assessed penicillin. One trial had three intervention groups: doxycycline, azithromycin, and placebo. Three trials assessed pre-exposure prophylaxis, one trial assessed postexposure prophylaxis, and one did not report this clearly. Four trials recruited residents in endemic areas, and one trial recruited soldiers who experienced limited time exposure. The participants' ages in the included trials were 10 to 80 years. Follow-up ranged from one to three months. Antibiotics versus placebo. Doxycycline compared with placebo may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.83; 1 trial, 782 participants; low-certainty evidence). Prophylactic antibiotics may have little to no effect on laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.26; 5 trials, 2593 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Antibiotics may result in little to no difference in the clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis regardless of laboratory confirmation (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.08; 4 trials, 1653 participants; low-certainty evidence) and the clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis with laboratory confirmation (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.26; 4 trials, 1653 participants; low-certainty evidence). Antibiotics compared with placebo may increase non-serious adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 10.13, 95% CI 2.40 to 42.71; 3 trials, 1909 participants; very low-certainty evidence). One antibiotic versus another antibiotic. One trial assessed doxycycline versus azithromycin but did not report mortality. Compared to azithromycin, doxycycline may have little to no effect on laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis regardless of the presence of an identified clinical syndrome (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.32; 1 trial, 137 participants), on the clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis regardless of the presence of laboratory confirmation (RR 4.18, 95% CI 0.94 to 18.66; 1 trial, 137 participants), on the clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis confirmed by laboratory diagnosis (RR 4.18, 95% CI 0.94 to 18.66; 1 trial, 137 participants), and on non-serious adverse events (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.48; 1 trial, 137 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain. The certainty of evidence for all the outcomes was very low. None of the five included trials reported serious adverse events or assessed quality of life. One study is awaiting classification. Funding. Four of the five trials included statements disclosing their funding/supporting sources, and the remaining trial did not include this. Three of the four trials that disclosed their supporting sources received the supply of trial drugs directly from the same pharmaceutical company, and the remaining trial received financial support from a governmental source. Authors' conclusions: We do not know if antibiotics versus placebo or another antibiotic has little or have no effect on all-cause mortality or leptospirosis infection because the certainty of evidence is low or very low. We do not know if antibiotics versus placebo may increase the overall risk of non-serious adverse events because of very low-certainty evidence. We lack definitive rigorous data from randomised trials to support the use of antibiotics for the prophylaxis of leptospirosis infection. We lack trials reporting data on clinically relevant outcomes.",,,10.1002/14651858.CD014959.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD014959.pub2

Methods: Seven databases (PubMed, COCHRANE, EMBASE, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, and CBM) were screened for random controlled trials on the prevention and treatment of IID by CHD from January 1980 to May 2022. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias (ROB 2.0) was applied for bias risk assessment, and the Grading Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) for quality of evidence. Meta-analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.3 software. In addition, a subgroup analysis was conducted on different grades of diarrhea, the incidence and duration of diarrhea, the selection of specific Chinese herbal medicine decoction, and the incidence of adverse reactions. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for all data by combining the meta-analysis with fixed or random-effects models based on outcome heterogeneity. Results: Fourteen RCTs involving 1056 participants were included. The study results displayed that the incidence of IID was lower with the use of CHD than the no-treatment group (RR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.40–0.75, P = 0.0002). CHD in combination with western medicine (WM) was more effective than WM alone for IID (RR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.23–0.84, P = 0.01). This protective effect was more pronounced for severe grade III–V diarrhea (RR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.26–0.64, P < 0.0001). In the specific Chinese herbal medicine decoction, the Banxia Xie Xin decoction presented better effectiveness (RR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05–0.63, P = 0.007) than WM alone. The Huangqin decoction was the most widely studied interventional scheme (n = 5). The relative risk (RR) of the Huangqin decoction was 0.56. No obvious adverse reactions were observed. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that CHD has a preventive effect on IID and could be used as a complementary therapy with few side effects. However, additional large-sample, high-quality, randomized, double-blind trials are needed to guide the clinical practice scientifically.

"Hemochromatosis: Ferroptosis, ROS, Gut Microbiome, and Clinical Challenges with Alcohol as Confounding Variable",,Teschke R.,3/18/24,4/10/24,International Journal of Molecular Sciences (2024) 25:5 Article Number: 2668. Date of Publication: 1 Mar 2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2024,25,5,,,1-Mar-24,Review,"1422-0067 (electronic),1661-6596","Hemochromatosis represents clinically one of the most important genetic storage diseases of the liver caused by iron overload, which is to be differentiated from hepatic iron overload due to excessive iron release from erythrocytes in patients with genetic hemolytic disorders. This disorder is under recent mechanistic discussion regarding ferroptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), the gut microbiome, and alcohol abuse as a risk factor, which are all topics of this review article. Triggered by released intracellular free iron from ferritin via the autophagic process of ferritinophagy, ferroptosis is involved in hemochromatosis as a specific form of iron-dependent regulated cell death. This develops in the course of mitochondrial injury associated with additional iron accumulation, followed by excessive production of ROS and lipid peroxidation. A low fecal iron content during therapeutic iron depletion reduces colonic inflammation and oxidative stress. In clinical terms, iron is an essential trace element required for human health. Humans cannot synthesize iron and must take it up from iron-containing foods and beverages. Under physiological conditions, healthy individuals allow for iron homeostasis by restricting the extent of intestinal iron depending on realistic demand, avoiding uptake of iron in excess. For this condition, the human body has no chance to adequately compensate through removal. In patients with hemochromatosis, the molecular finetuning of intestinal iron uptake is set off due to mutations in the high-FE(2+) (HFE) genes that lead to a lack of hepcidin or resistance on the part of ferroportin to hepcidin binding. This is the major mechanism for the increased iron stores in the body. Hepcidin is a liver-derived peptide, which impairs the release of iron from enterocytes and macrophages by interacting with ferroportin. As a result, iron accumulates in various organs including the liver, which is severely injured and causes the clinically important hemochromatosis. This diagnosis is difficult to establish due to uncharacteristic features. Among these are asthenia, joint pain, arthritis, chondrocalcinosis, diabetes mellitus, hypopituitarism, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and cardiopathy. Diagnosis is initially suspected by increased serum levels of ferritin, a non-specific parameter also elevated in inflammatory diseases that must be excluded to be on the safer diagnostic side. Diagnosis is facilitated if ferritin is combined with elevated fasting transferrin saturation, genetic testing, and family screening. Various diagnostic attempts were published as algorithms. However, none of these were based on evidence or quantitative results derived from scored key features as opposed to other known complex diseases. Among these are autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) or drug-induced liver injury (DILI). For both diseases, the scored diagnostic algorithms are used in line with artificial intelligence (AI) principles to ascertain the diagnosis. The first-line therapy of hemochromatosis involves regular and life-long phlebotomy to remove iron from the blood, which improves the prognosis and may prevent the development of end-stage liver disease such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver transplantation is rarely performed, confined to acute liver failure. In conclusion, ferroptosis, ROS, the gut microbiome, and concomitant alcohol abuse play a major contributing role in the development and clinical course of genetic hemochromatosis, which requires early diagnosis and therapy initiation through phlebotomy as a first-line treatment.",,"alcohol abuse,family screening,fasting transferrin saturation index,Fenton reaction,ferroptosis,genetic testing,gut microbiome,Haber–Weiss reaction,hemochromatosis,HFE genes,iron overload,phlebotomy,ROS,serum ferritin",10.3390/ijms25052668,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms25052668

Factors such as age, diet, antibiotic administration, and geographic location can affect the gut microbiota. The intra- and inter-individual variability of fecal microbiota in horses complicates its interpretation and has hindered the establishment of a clear definition for dysbiosis. Although a definitive causal relationship between gut dysbiosis in horses and diseases has not been clearly identified, recent research suggests that dysbiosis may play a role in the pathogenesis of various conditions, such as colitis and asthma. Prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation to modulate the horse’s gastrointestinal tract may eventually be considered a valuable tool for preventing or treating diseases, such as antibiotic-induced colitis.

Recurrent UTIs (rUTIs) can be particularly problematic and lead to potential hospitalizations, multiple antibiotic courses, and have a potential negative impact on quality of life. To prevent UTIs, antibiotics are frequently used for prophylaxis; however, antibiotic prophylaxis has notable untoward consequences including but not limited to potential adverse effects and development of antibiotic resistance. Methenamine, an antiseptic agent initially available in 1967, has re-emerged as a potential option for UTI prophylaxis in various populations, including older adults and renal transplant recipients. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of methenamine for UTI prophylaxis. A systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidance was performed. A PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library search was conducted to identify relevant English-language studies evaluating methenamine for UTI prophylaxis including randomized controlled trials, case–control studies, and meta-analyses through June 2023. Articles were excluded if the studies did not primarily describe or evaluate methenamine for UTI prophylaxis, were commentaries/viewpoints articles, point prevalence studies, review articles, studies that evaluated methenamine used with another agent, and any duplicate publications from searched databases. A total of 11 articles were identified for inclusion. This systematic review suggests methenamine generally appears to be an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic-sparing option for UTI prophylaxis. Furthermore, the pharmacology, dosage and formulation, warnings, precautions, and safety considerations of methenamine that provide potential clinical considerations regarding its use for UTI prophylaxis are described.

While FMT has secured approval and demonstrated efficacy in addressing recurrent and refractory Clostridioides difficile infection, its application in IBD remains an area of active exploration and research. The current status of FMT in IBD reflects a nuanced landscape, with ongoing investigations delving into its effectiveness, safety and optimal implementation. Early-stage clinical trials and observational studies have provided insights into the potential of FMT to modulate the dysbiotic gut microbiota associated with IBD, aiming to mitigate inflammation and promote mucosal healing. However, considerable complexities persist, including variations in donor selection, treatment protocols and outcome assessments. Challenges in standardizing FMT protocols for IBD treatment are compounded by the dynamic nature of the gut microbiome and the heterogeneity of IBD itself. Despite these challenges, enthusiasm for FMT in IBD emanates from its capacity to address gut microbial dysbiosis, signifying a paradigm shift towards more comprehensive approaches in IBD management.

Therapy includes salicylates, immunosuppressive agents, corticosteroids, and biologic drugs. International guidelines do not recommend the use of antibiotics for CD patients, except in the case of septic complications. Increasing evidence of the involvement of gut bacteria in this chronic disease supports the rationale for using antibiotics as the primary treatment for active CD. In recent decades, several pathogens have been reported to be involved in the development of CD, but only Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Mycobacterium avium paratubercolosis (MAP) have aroused interest due to their strong association with CD pathogenesis. Several meta-analyses have been published concerning antibiotic treatment for CD patients, but randomized trials testing antibiotic treatment against E. coli and MAP have not shown prolonged benefits and have generated conflicting results; several questions are still unresolved regarding trial design, antibiotic dosing, the formulation used, the treatment course, and the outcome measures. In this paper, we provide an overview and update of the trials testing antibiotic treatment for active CD patients, taking into account the role of pathogens, the mechanisms by which different antibiotics act on harmful pathogens, and antibiotic resistance.

In 2018, there were 7253 listed cases of FRI in Germany, corresponding to an incidence of 10.7 cases per 100 000 persons per year. Methods: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved from a search in PubMed with the search terms ""fracture,"" ""infection,"" ""guideline,"" and ""consensus."" Aside from the primary literature, international guidelines and consensus recommendations were evaluated as well. Results: FRI arise mainly from bacterial contamination of the fracture site. Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly detected pathogen. The treatment is based on surgery and antibiotics and should be agreed upon by an interdisciplinary team; it is often difficult because of biofilm formation. Treatment options include implant-preserving procedures and single-stage, two-stage, or multi-stage implant replacement. Treatment failure occurs in 10.3% to 21.4% of cases. The available evidence on the efficacy of various treatment approaches is derived mainly from retrospective cohort studies (level III evidence). Therefore, periprosthetic joint infections and FRI are often discussed together. Conclusion: FRI presents an increasing challenge. Preventive measures should be optimized, and the treatment should always be decided upon by an interdisciplinary team.

Outbreaks occur in areas with poor sanitation, including refugee camps. Several vaccines have been developed and tested over the last 50 years. This is an update of a Cochrane review, originally published in 1998, which explored the effects of all vaccines for preventing cholera. This review examines oral vaccines made from killed bacteria. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of the available World Health Organization (WHO)-prequalified oral killed cholera vaccines among children and adults. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; CENTRAL, MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; and two trials registers (February 2023). Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster-RCTs. There were no restrictions on the age and sex of the participants or the setting of the study. We considered any available WHO-prequalified oral killed cholera vaccine as an intervention. The control group was given a placebo, another vaccine, or no vaccine. The outcomes were related to vaccine effectiveness and safety. We included articles published in English only. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and extracted data from included studies. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane ROB 1 assessment tool. We used the generic inverse variance and a random-effects model meta-analysis to estimate the pooled effect of the interventions. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. For vaccine effectiveness (VE), we converted the overall risk ratio (RR) to vaccine effectiveness using the formula: VE = (1 - RR) x 100%. Main results: Five RCTs, reported in 12 records, with 462,754 participants, met the inclusion criteria. We identified trials on whole-cell plus recombinant vaccine (WC-rBS vaccine (Dukoral)) from Peru and trials on bivalent whole-cell vaccine (BivWC (Shanchol)) vaccine from India and Bangladesh. We did not identify any trials on other BivWC vaccines (Euvichol/Euvichol-Plus), or Hillchol. Two doses of Dukoral with or without a booster dose reduces cases of cholera at two-year follow-up in a general population of children and adults, and at five-month follow-up in an adult male population (overall VE 76%; RR 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.65; 2 trials, 16,423 participants; high-certainty evidence). Two doses of Shanchol reduces cases of cholera at one-year follow-up (overall VE 37%; RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.85; 2 trials, 241,631 participants; high-certainty evidence), at two-year follow-up (overall VE 64%; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.81; 2 trials, 168,540 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and at five-year follow-up (overall VE 80%; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.26; 1 trial, 54,519 participants; high-certainty evidence). A single dose of Shanchol reduces cases of cholera at six-month follow-up (overall VE 40%; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.77; 1 trial, 204,700 participants; high-certainty evidence), and at two-year follow-up (overall VE 39%; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.70; 1 trial, 204,700 participants; high-certainty evidence). A single dose of Shanchol also reduces cases of severe dehydrating cholera at six-month follow-up (overall VE 63%; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.50; 1 trial, 204,700 participants; high-certainty evidence), and at two-year follow-up (overall VE 50%; RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.60; 1 trial, 204,700 participants; high-certainty evidence). We found no differences in the reporting of adverse events due to vaccination between the vaccine and control/placebo groups. Authors' conclusions: Two doses of Dukoral reduces cases of cholera at two-year follow-up. Two doses of Shanchol reduces cases of cholera at five-year follow-up, and a single dose of Shanchol reduces cases of cholera at two-year follow-up. Overall, the vaccines were safe and well-tolerated. We found no trials on other BivWC vaccines (Euvichol/Euvichol-Plus). However, BivWC products (Shanchol, Euvichol/Euvichol-Plus) are considered to produce comparable vibriocidal responses. Therefore, it is reasonable to apply the results from Shanchol trials to the other BivWC products (Euvichol/Euvichol-Plus).",,,10.1002/14651858.CD014573,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD014573

The connection with the gut microbiome led to oral probiotics as a therapeutic strategy. However, being viable microorganisms, probiotics might present risks. Thus, non-viable postbiotics have been considered as an alternative. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of oral Lactobacillus postbiotics for managing symptoms of AD in pediatric and adult patients. A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Nine randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of non-viable Lactobacillus spp. administered orally to patients diagnosed with AD were included in the review, in which 512 subjects were evaluated after the intervention. Most studies allowed the concomitant usage of corticosteroids. Three studies focused on adults and indicated symptom improvement. In contrast, three out of six trials evaluating pediatric patients did not report postbiotics-favoring results. The dosage seems to be relevant for outcome determination. Two trials compared postbiotics with their viable analogs, and only one reported positive results in both groups. Postbiotics-associated shifts in gut microbial communities were reported in one trial. Mild adverse effects were detected by a single study. The overall results suggested that Lactobacillus postbiotics might be successfully used as adjuvant AD therapy in adults. Thus far, data do not indicate efficacy in pediatric patients. Standardizing nomenclatures and experimental procedures, as well as expanding the studies to more geographic locations and assessing comprehensively the effects on the gut microbiome would provide better perspectives of postbiotics as a therapeutic option for AD.",,"brain-gut-skin axis,gut microbiome,heat-killed,inflammatory skin diseases,Lactobacillus",10.1080/27697061.2023.2232021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/27697061.2023.2232021

Historically, two antibiotics (metronidazole and vancomycin) and a recent third (fidaxomicin) have been used for CDI treatment; convincing data are now available showing that metronidazole is the least efficacious agent. The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) management guidance for CDI were updated in 2021. This guidance document outlines the treatment options for a variety of CDI clinical scenarios and for non-antimicrobial management (e.g., faecal microbiota transplantation, FMT). One of the main changes is that metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line CDI treatment. Rather, fidaxomicin is preferred on the basis of reduced recurrence rates with vancomycin as an acceptable alternative. Recommended options for recurrent CDI now include bezlotoxumab as well as FMT. A 2017 survey of 20 European countries highlighted variation internationally in CDI management strategies. A variety of restrictions were in place in 65% countries prior to use of new anti-CDI treatments, including committee/infection specialist approval or economic review/restrictions. This survey was repeated in November 2022 to assess the current landscape of CDI management practices in Europe. Of 64 respondents from 17 countries, national CDI guidelines existed in 14 countries, and 11 have already/plan to incorporate the ESCMID 2021 CDI guidance, though implementation has not been surveyed in 6. Vancomycin is the most commonly used first-line agent for the treatment of CDI (n = 42, 66%), followed by fidaxomicin (n = 30, 47%). Six (9%) respondents use metronidazole as first-line agent for CDI treatment, whereas 22 (34%) only in selected low-risk patient groups. Fidaxomicin is more likely to be used in high-risk patient groups. Availability of anti-CDI therapy influenced prescribing in six respondents (9%). Approval pre-prescription was required before vancomycin (n = 3, 5%), fidaxomicin (n = 10, 6%), bezlotoxumab (n = 11, 17%) and FMT (n = 10, 6%). Implementation of CDI guidelines is rarely audited. Novel anti-CDI agents are being evaluated; it is not yet clear what will be the roles of these agents.

Several genetic and environmental factors are involved in the onset and development of metabolic disorders and related complications. A critical role also exists for the gut microbiota, a complex polymicrobial ecology at the interface of the internal and external environment. The gut microbiota contributes to food digestion and transformation, caloric intake, and immune response of the host, keeping the homeostatic control in health. Mechanisms of disease include enhanced energy extraction from the non-digestible dietary carbohydrates, increased gut permeability and translocation of bacterial metabolites which activate a chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and insulin resistance, as precursors of tangible metabolic disorders involving glucose and lipid homeostasis.

This is an invasive procedure that could lead to short bowel syndrome. In the 21st century, several new enteroscopy techniques were distributed worldwide, including DBE, single-balloon enteroscopy, spiral enteroscopy, and motorized spiral enteroscopy. These devices enable the diagnoses and endoscopic interventions in the entire small bowel, even in patients with a history of laparotomy. In patients with Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (PJS), endoscopic ischemic polypectomy with clips or a detachable snare is the preferred method for managing pedunculated polyps because it is less likely to cause adverse events than conventional polypectomy. Although polyps in patients with PJS always recur, repeat endoscopic resection can reduce the total number and mean size of polyps in the long-term clinical course. Endoscopic reduction of small-bowel intussusception caused by PJS polyps can be successfully performed using DBE without surgery. A transparent hood is useful for securing a visual field during the treatment of small-bowel polyps, and minimal water exchange method is recommended to facilitate deep insertion. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer. Because jejunal and ileal polyps in patients with FAP have the potential to develop into cancer via the adenoma–carcinoma sequence, periodical surveillance, and endoscopic resection are needed for them, not only polyps in the duodenum. In cases of multiple small-bowel polyps in patients with FAP, cold snare polypectomy without retrieval is an acceptable treatment option for polyps that are 10 mm or smaller in size.

Over the last 20 years, there have been almost 200 studies evaluating resveratrol across at least 24 indications, including cancer, menopause symptoms, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. There are currently no consensus treatment regimens for any given condition or endpoint, beyond the fact that resveratrol is generally well-tolerated at a dose of up to 1 g/day. Additionally, resveratrol consistently reduces inflammatory markers and improves aspects of a dysregulated metabolism.

The Gut microbiota (GM) produce neuroactives, specifically neurotransmitters that modulates local and central neuronal brain functions. An imbalance between intestinal commensals and pathobionts leads to a disruption in the gut microbiota or dysbiosis, which affects intestinal barrier integrity and gut-immune and neuroimmune systems. Currently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is recommended for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. FMT elicits its action by ameliorating inflammatory responses through the restoration of microbial composition and functionality. Thus, FMT may be a potential therapeutic option in suppressing neuroinflammation in post-stroke conditions and other neurological disorders involving the neuroimmune axis. Specifically, FMT protects against ischemic injury by decreasing IL-17, IFN-γ, Bax, and increasing Bcl-2 expression. Interestingly, FMT improves cognitive function by lowering amyloid-β accumulation and upregulating synaptic marker (PSD-95, synapsin-1) expression in Alzheimer’s disease. In Parkinson’s disease, FMT was shown to inhibit the expression of TLR4 and NF-κB.

Butyrate is an important metabolite of intestinal microorganisms. Recent studies have shown that butyrate has a significant protective effect in animal models of cerebral ischaemic injury. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of butyrate on cerebral ischaemic stroke by meta-analysis, aiming to provide a scientific basis for the clinical application of butyrate in patients with cerebral ischaemia. Materials and methods: A systematic search was conducted for all relevant studies published before 23 January 2024, in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Methodological quality was assessed using Syrcle’s risk of bias tool for animal studies. Data were analysed using Rev Man 5.3 software. Results: A total of nine studies were included, and compared with controls, butyrate significantly increased BDNF levels in the brain (SMD = 2.33, 95%CI = [1.20, 3.47], p < 0.005) and P-Akt expression (SMD = 3.53, 95% CI = [0.97, 6.10], p < 0.05). Butyrate also decreased IL-β levels in the brain (SMD = −2.02, 95% CI = [−3.22, −0.81], p < 0.005), TNF-α levels (SMD = −0.86, 95% CI = [−1.60, −0.12], p < 0.05), and peripheral vascular IL-1β levels (SMD = −2.10, 95%CI = [−3.59, −0.61], p < 0.05). In addition, butyrate reduced cerebral infarct volume (MD = −11.29, 95%CI = [−17.03, −5.54], p < 0.05), mNSS score (MD = −2.86, 95%CI = [−4.12, −1.60], p < 0.005), foot fault score (MD = −7.59, 95%CI = [−9.83, −5, 35], p < 0.005), and Morris water maze time (SMD = −2.49, 95%CI = [−4.42, −0.55], p < 0.05). Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that butyrate has a protective effect on cerebral ischaemic stroke in animal models, and the mechanism is related to reducing inflammation and inhibiting apoptosis. It provides an evidence-based basis for the future clinical development of butyrate in the treatment of ischaemic stroke.

Treat to target in Crohn’s disease: A practical guide for clinicians,,Srinivasan A.R.,1/16/24,1/24/24,World Journal of Gastroenterology (2024) 30:1 (50-69). Date of Publication: 2024,World Journal of Gastroenterology,2024,30,1,50,69,2024,Review,"2219-2840 (electronic),1007-9327","A treat-to-target (T2T) approach applies the principles of early intervention and tight disease control to optimise long-term outcomes in Crohn's disease. The Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE)-II guidelines specify short, intermediate, and long-term treatment goals, documenting specific treatment targets to be achieved at each of these timepoints. Scheduled appraisal of Crohn’s disease activity against pre-defined treatment targets at these timepoints remains central to determining whether current therapy should be continued or modified. Consensus treatment targets in Crohn’s disease comprise combination clinical and patient-reported outcome remission, in conjunction with biomarker normalisation and endoscopic healing. Although the STRIDE-II guidelines endorse the pursuit of endoscopic healing, clinicians must consider that this may not always be appropriate, acceptable, or achievable in all patients. This underscores the need to engage patients at the outset in an effort to personalise care and individualise treatment targets. The use of non-invasive biomarkers such as faecal calprotectin in conjunction with cross-sectional imaging techniques, particularly intestinal ultrasound, holds great promise; as do emerging treatment targets such as transmural healing. Two randomised clinical trials, namely, CALM and STARDUST, have evaluated the efficacy of a T2T approach in achieving endoscopic endpoints in patients with Crohn’s disease. Findings from these studies reflect that patient subgroups and Crohn’s disease characteristics likely to benefit most from a T2T approach, remain to be clarified. Moreover, outside of clinical trials, data pertaining to the real-world effectiveness of a T2T approach remains scare, highlighting the need for pragmatic real-world studies. Despite the obvious promise of a T2T approach, a lack of guidance to support its integration into real-world clinical practice has the potential to limit its uptake. This highlights the need to describe strategies, processes, and models of care capable of supporting the integration and execution of a T2T approach in real-world clinical practice. Hence, this review seeks to examine the current and emerging literature to provide clinicians with practical guidance on how to incorporate the principles of T2T into routine clinical practice for the management of Crohn’s disease.",,"Crohn’s disease,Endoscopic remission,Inflammatory bowel disease,Intestinal ultrasound,Time to response,Transmural healing,Treat to target,Treatment targets",10.3748/wjg.v30.i1.50,http://dx.doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v30.i1.50

In addition to elderly individuals, children are also at higher risk of CDI-IBD. Rapid diagnosis is essential since the clinical manifestations of active IBD and CDI-IBD are indistinguishable. Antibiotics have been well established in the treatment of CDI-IBD, but they do not prevent recurrence. Areas covered: Herein, the authors focus on reviewing recent research advances on the new therapies of CDI-IBD. The novel therapies include gut microbiota restoration therapies (such as prebiotics, probiotics and FMT), immunotherapy (such as vaccines and monoclonal antibodies) and diet strategies (such as groningen anti-inflammatory diet and mediterranean diet). Future extensive prospective and placebo-controlled studies are required to evaluate their efficacy and long-term safety. Expert opinion: Available studies show that the prevalence of CDI-IBD is not optimistic. Currently, potential treatment options for CDI-IBD include a number of probiotics and novel antibiotics.

Date of Publication: 2024,Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,2024,14,,,,2024,Review,2235-2988 (electronic),"Introduction: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of gestational diabetes mellitus characterized by insulin resistance and abnormal function of pancreatic beta cells. In recent years, genomic association studies have revealed risk and susceptibility genes associated with genetic susceptibility to GDM. However, genetic predisposition cannot explain the rising global incidence of GDM, which may be related to the increased influence of environmental factors, especially the gut microbiome. Studies have shown that gut microbiota is closely related to the occurrence and development of GDM. This paper reviews the relationship between gut microbiota and the pathological mechanism of GDM, in order to better understand the role of gut microbiota in GDM, and to provide a theoretical basis for clinical application of gut microbiota in the treatment of related diseases. Methods: The current research results on the interaction between GDM and gut microbiota were collected and analyzed through literature review. Keywords such as ""GDM"", ""gut microbiota"" and ""insulin resistance"" were used for literature search, and the methodology, findings and potential impact on the pathophysiology of GDM were systematically evaluated. Results: It was found that the composition and diversity of gut microbiota were significantly associated with the occurrence and development of GDM. Specifically, the abundance of certain gut bacteria is associated with an increased risk of GDM, while other changes in the microbiome may be associated with improved insulin sensitivity. In addition, alterations in the gut microbiota may affect blood glucose control through a variety of mechanisms, including the production of short-chain fatty acids, activation of inflammatory pathways, and metabolism of the B vitamin group. Discussion: The results of this paper highlight the importance of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of GDM. The regulation of the gut microbiota may provide new directions for the treatment of GDM, including improving insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control through the use of probiotics and prebiotics. However, more research is needed to confirm the generality and exact mechanisms of these findings and to explore potential clinical applications of the gut microbiota in the management of gestational diabetes. In addition, future studies should consider the interaction between environmental and genetic factors and how together they affect the risk of GDM.",,"chronic inflammatory state,gestational diabetes mellitus,gut microbiota,insulin resistance,pathogenesis",10.3389/fcimb.2024.1364545,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1364545

Despite multiple interventions focusing on nutrition adequacy, 2.7 million children world-wide remain associated with undernutrition-related mortality. The lack of impact from multiple interventions toward undernutrition reflects a strong reason to believe that EED is the missing link that sustains undernutrition in low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs). EED is a sub-clinical condition caused by repeated oral enteropathogenic and non-pathogenic fecal microbes exposure that causes intestinal villous malformation, multi-omics changes, chronic intestinal and systemic inflammation, and gut dysbiosis. EED impacts the absorptive capacity and the integrity of the gut, causing a cycle of undernutrition in children. There is currently no protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of EED, hence EED is widely believed to be highly prevalent and underdiagnosed in LMICs. Objective – To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to study the impact of nutritional interventions on EED. Previous studies yielded inconsistent results, hence the synthesis of this information is essential in attaining a deeper understanding of EED to formulate new targets of intervention against child under-nutrition. Methods – This systematic review is registered to PROSPERO (CRD42022363157) in accordance to PRISMA, using keywords referring to nutrient supplementation, EED, and child growth failure. Results – Eleven articles were eligible for review, comprising randomized controlled trials performed mainly in the African continent, with a total of 5689 healthy children eligible for analysis. Conclusion – The systematic review illustrates that nutritional interventions have a minimal impact on EED biomarkers and linear growth and reflects the importance of understanding better the mechanisms causing EED and its consequences.

Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2024,SAGE Open Medicine,2024,12,,,,1-Jan-24,Review,2050-3121 (electronic),"Background: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been linked to over 200,000 cases of illness in hospitalized patients and over 20,000 deaths annually. Up to 25% of patients with an initial CDI episode will experience recurrent CDI (rCDI), which most commonly occurs in the first 8 weeks following antibiotic therapy. In patients with first or multiple rCDI, infection, the microbiome is similarly disrupted, which highlights the challenges of using antibiotics alone while underscoring the need for microbiome restoration regardless of the number of recurrences. In this systematic review, we describe the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome in CDI, and systematically review fecal microbiota spores, live-brpk (VOWST™; VOS for Vowst Oral Spores) for prevention of recurrence in rCDI. Methods: The PubMed database was searched using “recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection” AND (SER-109 OR VOS) and limited to clinical trials. The search yielded 7 results: 3 articles describing 3 clinical trials (two Phase 3 trials (ECOSPOR III and ECOSPOR IV) and one Phase 2 trial (ECOSPOR)), 1 describing follow-up of ECOSPOR III, 1 describing a post hoc analysis of comorbidities in ECOSPOR III, and 2 describing health-related quality of life in ECOSPOR III. Results: Compared with placebo, VOS following standard-of-care antibiotics for CDI significantly reduced risk of recurrence at 8 weeks (relative risk, 0.32 (95% CI: 0.18–0.58); p < 0.001; number needed to treat: 4) with a tolerable safety profile; rCDI rates remained low through 24 weeks. The disrupted microbiome, secondary to/exacerbated by antibiotic treatment, was rapidly (i.e., Week 1) restored with VOS. Compared with placebo, VOS demonstrated greater improvements in health-related quality of life.

Date of Publication: 2024,Frontiers in Pharmacology,2024,15,,,,2024,Review,1663-9812 (electronic),"Background: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of healthcare-associated infectious diarrhea. A major clinical challenge is recurrent CDI (rCDI) without effective standard drug-based therapy. Additionally, a comprehensive comparison of various therapy effectiveness in rCDI patients is still under investigation. Methods: A Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized control trials up to March 2024 was performed to investigate the efficacy of rCDI interventions. Results: Seventeen trials were included, comprising 4,148 CDI patients with ten interventions, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) by lower gastrointestinal (LGI), FMT by upper gastrointestinal (UGI), Autologous FMT (AFMT), vancomycin + FMT, vancomycin, placebo, fidaxomicin, Vowst (SER109), Rebyota (RBX2660), and monoclonal antibody. NMA showed that FMT by LGI had the highest efficacy in treating rCDIs with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 32.33 (4.03, 248.69) compared with placebo. FMT by UGI also showed high efficacy, whereas the efficacy comparison between FMT by LGI and UGI was not statistically significant (ORs) (95% CI), 1.72 (0.65, 5.21). The rankogram and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) also showed FMT by LGI ranked at the top and FMT by UGI ranked second in the curative effect. Conclusion: NMA demonstrates FMT’s significant efficacy in rCDI management, regardless of administration route (lower or upper gastrointestinal). Despite its significant benefits, FMT’s safety is a concern due to the lack of standardized FDAcompliant manufacturing and oversight. Microbiota-based therapies also exhibit potential. However, limited research mandates further clinical exploration. Antibiotics, in contrast, display comparatively reduced efficacy in rCDI, potentially linked to disruptions in native gut microflora balance.

Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO) is generally referred to as an unexplained prolonged fever. However, a standardized FUO definition and management is missing. Objective: To collect updated data on the approach to fever and FUO among Italian pediatricians. Methods: A cross-sectional anonymous survey was conducted among a large sample of primary care and hospital pediatricians. The panel group formulated and proposed a practical FUO definition, using a modified Delphi approach. A 75% consensus was required to reach an agreement. Results: Among 620 respondents, paracetamol was the first-choice antipyretic for 97.7% of participants, followed by ibuprofen; 38.4% prescribed antipyretics based on a specific body temperature rather than on child's discomfort, while physical methods were almost completely abandoned. Alternate treatment was recommended by 19.8% (123/620) of participants, 16.9% (105/620) would prescribe antipyretics to prevent adverse events following immunization. Regarding FUO diagnosis, 58.3% (362/620) considered as cut-off a body temperature above 38°C; the duration required was one week according to 36.45% (226/620) of participants, two weeks according to 35.32% (219/620). The FUO definition proposed by the expert panel reached 81% of consent. Large agreement was observed on first-level laboratory and instrumental investigations in the diagnostic evaluation of FUO, whereas more discrepancies arose on second and third-level investigations. Compared to what participants reported for the treatment of non-prolonged fever, a significant decrease in the prescription of paracetamol as first-choice drug in children with FUO was observed (80.5%; P < 0.0001). Interestingly, 39% of participants would empirically recommend antibiotics, 13.7% steroids, and 4.5% Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) for persistent FUO. Conclusion: Non-recommended behaviors in fever management persist among pediatricians, including alternating use of paracetamol and ibuprofen, and their prophylactic use for vaccinations. Our data confirm the variability in the definition, work-up, and management of FUO. We observed that in children with FUO paracetamol was significantly less commonly preferred than in non-prolonged fever, which is not supported by evidence.

Within our cells, a complex molecular dance occurs, where these components intertwine in a mesmerizing ballet that plays a decisive role in our health. Mitochondria, beyond being energy powerhouses, modulate nuclear gene expression through messengers like reactive oxidative stress (ROS) and calcium. Epigenetics, acting as the molecular conductor, regulates the expression of both nuclear and mitochondrial genes through modifications like DNA methylation. The intestinal microbiota itself produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that influence mitochondrial activity. SCFA-induced epigenetic modifications, like histone acetylation, impact mitochondrial function which may lead to disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction generates retrograde signals that alter nuclear gene expression, as evidenced by increased histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in genes essential for neuronal differentiation and mitochondrial reprogramming. Alterations in the mitochondrial-nuclear-microbiota axis are associated with diseases including diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Modulating the intestinal microbiota with probiotics or prebiotics can restore balance while intervening in mitochondrial pathways, which can be a therapeutic strategy. Additionally, using epigenetic agents like histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can reprogram gene expression and improve mitochondrial function. Finally, the present review aims to explore the central interplay between mitochondria, epigenetics modifications, and microbiota in a complex and dynamic molecular context that plays a fundamental role in human health. Specifically, it will examine the impact of microbiome components and metabolites generated from normobiosis and dysbiosis on mitochondria and epigenetic modifications across different diseases and metabolic conditions.

Date of Publication: 2024,PeerJ,2024,12,12,,,2024,Article,2167-8359 (electronic),"Background: Dietary therapy strategies play an important role in the treatment of pediatric patients with Crohn’s disease (CD), but the relative efficacy of different dietary therapy strategies for Crohn’s remission is unknown. This study aims to compare the effectiveness and tolerance of these dietary therapy strategies for active pediatric CD. Methods: We searched the medical literature up to August 30, 2024 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of dietary therapy strategies for pediatric CD. The primary outcomes were clinical remission rate and tolerance, secondary outcomes included differences between pre- and post-treatment levels of albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fecal calprotectin levels. A network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed by using the frequentist model. For binary outcome variables and continuous outcome variables, odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were utilized, respectively. The ranking of dietary therapy strategies was determined based on the surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) for each comparison analyzed. Results: Overall, 14 studies involving 564 participants were included. In terms of clinical remission rate, the partial enteral nutrition (PEN) plus Crohn’s disease exclusion diet (PEN+CDED) (OR = 7.86, 95% CI [1.85–33.40]) and exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) (OR = 3.74, 95% CI [1.30–10.76]) exhibited significant superiority over PEN alone. The tolerance of PEN+CDED was significantly higher than that of EEN (OR = 0.07, 95% CI [0.01–0.61]). According to the surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) values, the PEN+CDED intervention (90.5%) achieved the highest ranking in clinical remission rate. In terms of tolerance, PEN+CDED ranked first (88.0%), while EEN ranked last (16.3%). Conclusions: In conclusion, PEN+CDED was associated with the highest clinical remission rate and tolerance among the various dietary therapy strategies evaluated. Despite limitations in the studies, this systematic review provides evidence that PEN +CDED can be used as an alternative treatment to exclusive enteral nutrition and is more suitable for long-term management in children.",,"Children,Crohn’s disease,Dietary therapy strategies,Inflammatory bowel disease,Meta-analysis,Systematic review",10.7717/peerj.18692,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.18692

However, it remains uncertain when exploring the preferable option among different CHM therapies for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Aim of the study: To compare and rank the efﬁcacy and safety of different CHM therapies for IBS-D. Materials and methods: We searched randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials through mainstream databases from their inception to October 31, 2022. Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) applied one of the CHM therapies as the experimental group and placebo as the control group. Two authors independently extracted data into a form and evaluated the quality of the retrieved articles by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. At least one of the following outcomes was assessed: Serotonin, Neuropeptide Y (NPY), Incidence of Adverse Events (AE), and Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) with its subscales of Severity of Abdominal Pain (SAP), Frequency of Abdominal Pain (FAP), Severity of Abdominal Distension (SAD), Dissatisfaction with Bowel Habits (DBH), and Interference with Quality of Life (IQOL). A Bayesian network meta-analysis on a random-effect model was conducted using R 4.2.2 software. Results: 1367 records were retrieved from databases in an initial search. Fourteen studies involving six interventions with 2248 participants were identified. Provided pairwise comparisons, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) ranking, and cluster analysis, JPWS was the best option for ameliorating clinical symptoms simultaneously, which included IBS-SSS, SAP, FAP, SAD, DBH, and IQOL. As for AE, JPWS contributed to fewer adverse events than others as well. In respect of serum indicators, we noticed the dominance of SGJP in regulating both serotonin and NPY. Conclusions: JPWS and SGJP were the most prominent CHM therapies for IBS-D in terms of clinical symptoms, including abdominal pain, distension, bowel habits, and improvement of quality of life. The effect of JP and SG for IBS-D required further investigation. As a potential candidate, SGJP may well treat IBS-D by mediating dysmotility, visceral hypersensitivity, and the gut-brain axis with an increase of NPY and a reduction of serotonin. For safety, JPWS was ideal for the fewest adverse events in the treatment of IBS-D. On account of a small sample size and possible geographical publication bias, more double-blinded and placebo-controlled trials with larger samples worldwide would be necessary for strengthening current evidence.",,"Chinese herbal medicine,Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome,Double-blinded,Network meta-analysis,Placebo-controlled trials",10.1016/j.jep.2023.116672,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2023.116672

Recent evidence suggests that the early-life gut microbiome affects child growth through immune, metabolic and endocrine pathways. Using whole metagenomic sequencing, we map the assembly of the gut microbiome in 335 children from rural Zimbabwe from 1–18 months of age who were enrolled in the Sanitation, Hygiene, Infant Nutrition Efficacy Trial (SHINE; NCT01824940), a randomized trial of improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and infant and young child feeding (IYCF). Here, we show that the early-life gut microbiome undergoes programmed assembly that is unresponsive to the randomized interventions intended to improve linear growth. However, maternal HIV infection is associated with over-diversification and over-maturity of the early-life gut microbiome in their uninfected children, in addition to reduced abundance of Bifidobacterium species. Using machine learning models (XGBoost), we show that taxonomic microbiome features are poorly predictive of child growth, however functional metagenomic features, particularly B-vitamin and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways, moderately predict both attained linear and ponderal growth and growth velocity.

This study investigates the H. pylori eradication rate in Africa using the best available evidence from databases. Methods: Databases were searched and results were pooled together. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using I(2) test statistics. Stata version 13 software was employed to compute the pooled eradication rate. In the subgroup analysis comparison, the finding is considered significant when the confidence intervals did not overlap. Results: Twenty-two studies from 9 African countries with a total population of 2,163 were included in this study. The pooled eradication rate of H. pylori was 79% (95% CI: 75%-82%), heterogeneity (I(2) = 93.02%). In the subgroup analysis by study design, a higher eradication rate was reported from observational studies (85%, 95% CI: 79%-90%), compared to randomized control trials (77%, 95% CI: 73%-82%); by the duration of therapy, higher eradication rate was reported in 10-days regimen (88%, 95% CI: 84%-92%), compared to 7-days regimen (66%, 95% CI: 55%-77%); by country, the highest eradication rate was found in Ethiopia (90%; 95% CI: 87%-93%) and the lowest eradication rate was reported in Ivory Coast (22.3%; 95% CI:15%-29%); by type of H. pylori test, the highest eradication rate was reported when rapid urease test coupled with histology (88%, 95% CI: 77%-96%), and the lowest eradication rate was reported with histology alone (22.3%; 95% CI:15%-29%). Significant heterogeneity was observed with pooled prevalence (I(2) = 93.02%, P < 0.000). Conclusions: In Africa, the first-line therapy showed a variable eradication rate for H. pylori. This study demonstrates the necessity to optimize current H. pylori treatment regimens in each country, taking into account the antibiotic susceptibility.

Several epidemiological studies have associated specific urinary and gut microbial species with increased risk of prostate cancer; however, causal mechanistic data remain elusive. Studies have associated bacterial generation of genotoxins with the occurrence of TMPRSS2–ERG gene fusions, a common, early oncogenic event during prostate carcinogenesis. A subsequent study demonstrated the role of the gut microbiota in prostate cancer endocrine resistance, which occurs, at least partially, through the generation of androgenic steroids fuelling oncogenic signalling via the androgen receptor. These studies present mechanistic evidence of how the host microbiota might be implicated in prostate carcinogenesis and tumour progression. Importantly, these findings also reveal potential avenues for the detection and treatment of prostate cancer through the profiling and modulation of the host microbiota. The latter could involve approaches such as the use of faecal microbiota transplantation, prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics or antibiotics, which can be used independently or combined with existing treatments to reverse therapeutic resistance and improve clinical outcomes in patients with prostate cancer.",,,10.1038/s41585-023-00795-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41585-023-00795-2
Efficacy of mouthwash on reducing salivary SARS-CoV-2 viral load and clinical symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis,,"Zhang M., Meng N., Duo H., Yang Y., Dong Q., Gu J.",10/19/23,10/30/23,BMC Infectious Diseases (2023) 23:1 Article Number: 678. Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2023,BMC Infectious Diseases,2023,23,1,,,1-Dec-23,Article,1471-2334 (electronic),"Background: COVID-19 has been a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) for a lengthy period of time. The novel coronavirus is primarily spread via aerosols at a short distance, with infected individuals releasing large amounts of aerosols when speaking and coughing. However, there is an open question regarding whether mouthwash could effectively reduce virus transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic and support the prevention of infection among medical workers. Methods: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases were systematically searched from the inception of each database to January 12, 2023 for currently available randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on the effect of mouthwash on novel coronavirus load in the oral cavity in COVID-19 patients. The treatment group received mouthwash for rinsing the mouth, while the control group received a placebo or distilled water for COVID-19 patients. The primary outcomes were CT value and viral load. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using a random-effects model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to minimize the bias and the impact of heterogeneity. Results: Thirteen RCTs were included. Seven studies reported the intervention effect of mouthwash on the CT value of novel coronavirus. The analysis results showed that the mouthwash group had a positive impact on the CT value of novel coronavirus [SMD = 0.35, 95% CI (0.21, 0.50)] compared with the control group. In addition, subgroup analysis showed a significant positive effect of mouthwash on CT values in the treatment group compared with the control group, with chlorhexidine (CHX) [SMD = 0.33, 95% CI (0.10, 0.56)], povidone-iodine (PVP-I) [SMD = 0.61, 95% CI (0.23, 0.99)], or hydrogen peroxide (HP) [SMD = 1.04, 95% CI (0.30, 1.78)] as an ingredient of the mouthwash. Six studies reported the intervention effect of mouthwash on the viral load, 263 cases in the treatment group and 164 cases in the control group. The analysis results showed that there was no statistical difference between the mouthwash group and the control group in the viral load of novel coronavirus [SMD = -0.06, 95% CI (-0.18, 0.05)]. In the subgroup analysis by measurement time, there were statistically significant differences between the mouthwash and control groups for CT values [SMD = 0.52, 95% CI (0.31, 0.72)] and viral load [SMD = − 0.32, 95% CI (− 0.56, − 0.07)] within 30 min of gargling. Conclusions: In summary, mouthwash has some efficacy in reducing the viral load of novel coronavirus, especially within 30 min after rinsing the mouth. Mouthwash containing CHX, PVP-I and HP all had significant positive effects on CT values, and PVP-I-containing mouthwash may be a promising option to control novel coronavirus infections and relieve virus-related symptoms. However, studies on the dose and frequency of use of mouthwash for infection control are still lacking, which may limit the clinical application of mouthwash.

Methods: CNKI, Wanfang Academic Journal Full Text Database, VIP, Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for clinical studies on the treatment of IBS using Chinese patent medicines that were published from inception until March 15, 2023. The shortlisted data were strictly screened and the data were extracted and evaluated, followed by data analyses and collation using RevMan 5.4 and stata16 software. Results: The final 21 randomized controlled trials(RCT), which included 14 proprietary Chinese medicines that were all orally administered, were in a total population of 2007 patients. Meta-analysis revealed that the combination of Chinese patent medicines with Western medicines could improve the overall clinical effectiveness (OR = 3.81, 95 % CI [2.84–5.12], P < 0.00001); significantly improved the abdominal pain scores (MD = -0.66, 95 % CI [-0.93, -0.40], P < 0.00001); improved the stool trait scores (MD = -0.48, 95 % CI [-0.59, -0.37], P < 0.00001); improved the IBS symptom severity scale(IBS-SSS) scores (MD = -44.36, 95 % CI [-53.64, -35.08], P < 0.00001); improved IBS quality of life(IBS-QOL) -positive (MD = 10.27, 95 % CI [3.50, 17.04], P = 0.003 < 0.05) and -negative scores (MD = -7.91, 95 % CI[-15.62, -0.02], P = 0.04 < 0.05); and improved the Hamilton Anxiety Scale(HAMA) scores (MD = -3.37, 95 % CI [-6.49, -0.24], P = 0.03); albeit no statistical difference was noted in improving Hamilton Depression Scale(HAMD) scores (MD = -2.83, 95 % CI [-5.74, 0.08], P = 0.06 > 0.05). Conclusion: For treating irritable bowel syndrome, the effectiveness of combining Chinese patent medicine with Western medicine is better than that of using Western medicine alone both in terms of relieving gastrointestinal discomfort and regulating mood.

Consequently, patients follow very broad and strict elimination diets to avoid uncontrolled symptoms such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Dietary limitations and the uncertainty of developing gastrointestinal symptoms after the inadvertent ingestion of food have been demonstrated to reduce the quality of life (QoL) of affected individuals and subsequently might increase the risk of malnutrition and intestinal dysbiosis. This trial aims to investigate the effects of a tailored diet based on the confocal laser endoscopy (CLE) examination result to limit the side effects of unspecific and broad elimination diets and to increase the patient’s QoL. Methods and analysis The study is designed as a prospective, double-blind, monocentric, randomised and controlled trial conducted at the University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Lübeck, Germany. One hundred seventy-two patients with non-IgE-related food allergies and positive CLE results will be randomised to either a tailored diet or a standard fivefold elimination diet. The primary endpoints are the difference between the end and the start of the intervention in health-related QoL and the sum score of the severity of symptoms after 12 weeks. Key secondary endpoints are changes in the severity of symptoms, further QoL measurements, self-assessed state of health and number of days with a pathologically altered stool. Microbiome diversity and metabolome of stool, urine and blood will also be investigated. Safety endpoints are body composition, body mass index and adverse events.

The microbiota-gut-brain axis plays a bidirectional communication role between the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system. This bidirectional communication between the brain and gut is influenced by the neural, immune and endocrine systems related to the gut microbiome. A growing body of evidence indicates a strong link between dysregulation of the gut microbiota and PD. In this review, we present recent progress in understanding the relationship between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and PD. We focus on the role of the gut microbiota, the unique changes observed in the microbiome of PD patients, and the impact of these changes on the progression of PD. Finally, we evaluate the role of current treatment strategies for PD, including probiotics, fecal microbial transplants, dietary modifications, and related drug therapies.",,"gut microbiome,gut microbiota intervention,microbiota-gut-brain axis,Parkinson’s disease",10.31083/j.jin2206157,http://dx.doi.org/10.31083/j.jin2206157

Many patients do not reach the complete symptom alleviation, even by strict GFD. Recent studies have reported inconsistent results regarding the beneficial benefits of taking probiotics. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and the possible underlying causes in CD and celiac disease autoimmunity (CDA) patients. Databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science and Google Scholar, were searched for clinical trials published until July 2022 about assessing the effects of probiotics or synbiotics on CD or CDA patients. We collected data on GI symptoms, CD markers, inflammatory and immune responses, adverse events, and gut microbiota. A random effect meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and confidence interval (CI). We screened 7234 articles, of which 14 were included in the qualitative analysis and 5 in the quantitative analysis. Probiotics might alleviate GI symptoms, especially in the highly symptomatic patients, and improve immune response in CD and CDA patients. Results of the meta-analysis showed that probiotics increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium (SMD: 0.72, 95%CI (0.13, 1.30) and Lactobacillus (SMD: 0.49, 95%CI (0.18, 0.80) as compared with placebo.

Our group has investigated how a Mediterranean-type diet and its subsequent effect on the microbiome may improve metabolic health, lung function and decrease inflammation in World Trade Center (WTC)-particulate matter (PM) exposed firefighters with lung disease. METHODS: Design/Specimens: Our randomized clinical trial Food Intake REstriction for Health OUtcome Support and Education (FIREHOUSE); Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03581006 collected stool at baseline and 6 months post-intervention (OMNIgene-GUT kits; DNAgenotek) for a pilot N=5 in the low-calorie Mediterranean (LoCalMed) and N=5 Usual Care (UC) and validation cohort (N=15 and N=16 respectively). Microbiome was assessed using sequencing (BoosterShot Shotgun, Diversigen) and alignment of sequences to a bacterial database (Diversigen). Chao1 index, Shannon Index and operational taxonomic unit counts (OTU, taxonomic group) were calculated using a rarefied, filtered taxonomy table set to the minimum depth allowed for a sample (10,000). Bray-Curtis beta-diversity was calculated from the filtered taxonomy and KEGG module/enzyme relative abundance tables. QIIME 1.9.1, R and SPSS-28 software were used for analysis. RESULTS: Mean age, exposure at the WTC site and years of service were similar in both arms. Subjects were predominantly Caucasian. Shannon (a) diversity did not differ between arms at either timepoint, but decreased across time for the cohort (p=0.02 pilot, p<0.0001 validation). Similarly, microbial community composition (b-diversity) did not differ between arms at either timepoint or between timepoints. The abundance of specific microbial taxa did differ between timepoints in the pilot in that Bilophila wadsworthia had a higher relative abundance at the 6-month timepoint compared to baseline in the UC arm only. When incorporating health measures with microbiome analysis, a BMI reduction was associated with an increase in the abundance of Bacteroides ovatus in combined arm data(p=0.06). In the validation LoCalMed arm the family Ruminococcaceae decreased(p=0.015) when comparing post-intervention to baseline. In the UC arm the order Veillonellales (p=0.032);genus Anaeromassilibacillus(p=0.012); Johnsonella(p=0.042); Subdoligranulum(p=0.019); and species Bacteroides massiliensis(p=0.027); Alistipes ihumii (p=0.034); Clostridium asparagiforme (p=0.018) were reduced when comparing post-intervention to baseline. In contrast the species Bacteroides ovatus (p=0.03) and Alistipes shahii (p=0.038) were increased. CONCLUSIONS: In our UC pilot, Bilophila wadsworthia was increased and of note in the literature this bacterial species is associated with high fat diets and inflammation. In addition, health metrics such as BMI were associated with changes in Bacteroides ovatus. In our validation cohort Bacteroides ovatus was increased in the LoCalMed arm after 6-months. In a high fat diet consuming murine model gavaged with Bacteroides ovatus there were fewer negative health effects. Future studies will assess microbial association with clinical outcomes. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The FIREHOUSE RCT focuses on a multiOMIC comprehensive assessment of WTC-PM exposure associated lung disease and leverages the longitudinally phenotyped FDNY cohort to not only provide pathophysiologic insight but also to lay the groundwork for future therapeutics.

The advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 excluded the use of NSAIDs, particularly ibuprofen, and then indicated this drug as the better NSAID to manage infected outpatients and prevent complications. Several authors described the role of NSAIDs and ibuprofen in preventing cytokine storm and modulating the immune system. However, the development of both adverse drug reactions (i.e., gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular) and drug interaction recalled the necessity of prescribing the better NSAID for each patient.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and, specifically, its subtype nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a rising cause of liver disease. It is predicted to surpass hepatitis C as a leading indication for transplant. The introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) decreased the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C infections, but the obesity epidemic and metabolic syndrome have increased the prevalence of NASH. Weight loss and dietary modifications are recommended NASH therapies, but unlike for hepatitis C, federally approved agents are lacking and currently under investigation. Clinical trials face many barriers in NASH treatment because of the difficulty of diagnosis and a lack of standardized and accurate clinical and histologic responses. Mortality and morbidity in NASH are heightened because of the presence of multiple comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and renal dysfunction. A liver transplant may be indicated, but a thorough screening of candidates, including a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment, is essential to ensuring successful outcomes pre- and post-transplant.

Its prevalence is underestimated, and patients with alcohol-related liver disease are rarely diagnosed in the earlier phase of the disease spectrum. Alcoholic hepatitis is a distinct syndrome with life-threatening signs of systemic inflammation. In severe alcoholic hepatitis, prednisolone is indicated as the first-line treatment even with the possibility of various complications. Early liver transplantation can be another option for highly selected patients with a null response to prednisolone. Most importantly, abstinence is the mainstay of long-term care, but relapse is frequent among patients. Recent findings on the pathogenesis of alcoholic hepatitis have enabled us to discover new therapeutic targets. Preventing hepatic inflammation, reducing oxidative stress, improving gut dysbiosis, and enhancing liver regeneration are the main targets of emerging therapies.

There has been a significant increase in the breadth and depth of available technology utilized by RDTs. Recent Findings: There are numerous Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared assays for rapid detection of bacteria from various specimen types from sites including blood, stool, central nervous system, and respiratory tract. Most RDTs currently FDA-cleared are molecular tests designed as syndromic panels that provide identification of on-panel organisms and resistance genes. One FDA-cleared rapid phenotypic assay for antimicrobial susceptibility testing is currently available and others are in development. Studies of these technologies’ clinical impact consistently demonstrate improvements in clinical care processes such as time to de-escalation and escalation of antibiotic therapy, particularly for blood and respiratory specimen tests. Other RDTs show inconsistent impact on antibiotic use. Antimicrobial stewardship programs are vital to ensure the greatest benefit from RDTs in clinical practice. Summary: The advancement and implementation of RDTs, in conjunction with antimicrobial stewardship, to enhance treatment selection for bacterial infections should be regarded as a core element to improve clinical outcomes for patients. Although challenges exist in the use of RDTs, there is a need for continued innovation in technology, implementation science, and collaboration across clinical professions to optimize care.",,"Antimicrobial stewardship,Bacterial infections,Clinical microbiology,Rapid diagnostics",10.1007/s40495-023-00323-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40495-023-00323-1

Methods: A search of Medline, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Open Grey, and Google Scholar was conducted for eligible publications from 2002 to 2020 following the requirements outlined in the PRISMA guideline. The search strategy was based on the combination of the following terms: “probiotics,” “prebiotics,” “synbiotics,” and “cross-infection.” The logical operators “AND” (or the equivalent operator for the databases) and “OR” (e.g., probiotics OR prebiotics OR synbiotics) were used. Results: The results indicated that the probiotic consumption caused a significant reduction in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in 2/8 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating AAD/CDI. Also, 5/12 clinical trials highlighted the considerable effects of probiotics on the reduction or prevention of ventilator associated pneumoniae (VAP), so the mean prevalence of VAP was lower in the probiotic group than in the placebo group. The total rate of nosocomial infections among preterm infants was nonsignificantly higher in the probiotic group compared to the control group.

Although the number of studies for each type of surgery is limited, the data suggest that prophylactic systemic antibiotic may be unnecessary in noncontaminated facial plastic surgery, reduction mammaplasty, and breast augmentation. In addition, no benefit is apparent from extending the antibiotic prophylaxis over 24 h in rhinoplasty, aerodigestive tract reconstruction, and breast reconstruction. No studies assessing the necessity of antibiotic prophylaxis in abdominoplasty, lipotransfer, soft tissue tumor surgery, or gender affirmation surgery were identified. In conclusion, limited data are available on the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in clean and clean-contaminated plastic surgery. More studies on this topic are needed before strong recommendations can be made on the use of antibiotics in this setting.",,"Antibiotic prophylaxis,Perioperative care,Plastic surgery,Surgical wound infection",10.1016/j.bjps.2023.04.071,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjps.2023.04.071

The objective of this study was to conduct the first systematic literature review (SLR) to assess the humanistic burden of CDI on patient experiences, including HRQoL and related constructs, and attitudes towards treatment alternatives. Methods: An SLR was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles that assessed CDI, including recurrent CDI (rCDI), and patient-reported outcomes or HRQoL. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Collaboration abstracting services were used to conduct literature searches from 2010 to 2021 in the English language. This SLR was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Results: Of 511 identified articles, 21 met study inclusion criteria. The SLR showed CDI has a devastating impact on patients’ overall HRQoL that continues well beyond infection clearance. The impact of CDI on physical, emotional, social, and professional well-being rivaled abdominal symptoms of uncontrollable diarrhea, being worse for patients with rCDI. Patients with CDI feel isolated, depressed, lonely, and continue to be frightened of recurrences as well as being contagious to others. Most believe that they will never be free of CDI. Conclusion: CDI and rCDI are debilitating conditions affecting physical, psychological, social, and professional functioning of patients’ HRQoL, even long after the event has occurred. The results of this SLR suggest that CDI is a devastating condition in need of better prevention strategies, improved psychological support, and treatments that address the microbiome disruption to break the cycle of recurrence.

Since the emergence of the hypervirulent strain, ribotype 027, new strains have been reported to cause C. difficile infection (CDI) with poor health outcomes, including ribotypes 014/020, 017, 056, 106, and 078/126. These strains differ in their geographic distribution, genetic makeup, virulence factors, and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, which can affect their ability to cause disease and respond to treatment. As such, understanding C. difficile epidemiology is increasingly important to allow for effective prevention measures. Despite the heightened epidemiological surveillance of C. difficile over the past two decades, it remains challenging to accurately estimate the burden and international epidemiological trends given the lack of concerted global effort for surveillance, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2023,Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental,2023,143,,,,1-Jun-23,Article,"1532-8600 (electronic),0026-0495","Background: Obesity is a complex disease associated with multiple concurrent complications, and the coordinated targeting of multiple pathways in pharmacological treatment may improve weight loss outcomes. During synthesis, ghrelin is converted from the ‘inactive’ unacylated ghrelin (UAG) to the active acylated ghrelin (AG) by the enzyme ghrelin-O-acyltransferase (GOAT), stimulating appetite and food intake. Aims: To report the results of two Phase I studies investigating single rising doses (SRDs) or multiple rising doses (MRDs) of the novel oral GOAT inhibitor BI 1356225 versus placebo in male and postmenopausal/sterilised female subjects with overweight or obesity. Methods: The SRD study investigated single doses of BI 1356225 (0.1–20.0 mg) in healthy male subjects with a BMI of 18.5–29.9 kg/m(2) (SRD cohort) and assessed doses of 2.5 mg BI 1356225 under fed and fasted conditions (bioavailability [BA] cohort). The MRD study investigated multiple doses of BI 1356225 (0.2, 1.0, 2.5 or 10.0 mg) or 5.0 mg BI 1356225 with a single dose of midazolam and celecoxib (drug–drug interaction part) over 28 days in adults with a BMI of 27.0–39.9 kg/m(2). Results: Sixty-five subjects were treated in the SRD study. Drug-related adverse events (AEs) were reported for five subjects (9.1 %) in the SRD cohort and two subjects (20.0 %) in the BA cohort, with the most frequent being headache (SRD: n = 4, 9.8 %; BA: n = 1, 10.0 %). In the MRD study, two (2.3 %) of the 87 subjects treated discontinued treatment because of AEs. Drug-related AEs were reported for 18 subjects (20.7 %), did not increase with dose and were most frequently reported as headache (n = 5, 5.7 %) and gastrointestinal disorders (n = 5, 5.7 %). In both studies, exposure parameters (area under the concentration–time curve [AUC] and maximum plasma concentration [C(max)]) of BI 1356225 increased across dose groups, although this was less than dose-proportional across the entire dose range. In the BA cohort of the SRD study, AUC(0–∞) was slightly increased and C(max) slightly decreased in fed versus fasted conditions, with fed/fasted ratios (90 % CI) of 101.10 % (92.42, 110.60) and 91.67 % (78.50, 107.05), respectively. In both studies, AG concentrations and the AG/UAG ratio were dose-dependently decreased after BI 1356225 treatment from baseline versus placebo. In the MRD study, UAG concentrations were increased from baseline, but not dose-dependently. No differences were observed in bodyweight, appetite, food cravings, ad libitum food uptake or obesity-related biomarkers after 28 days of treatment with BI 1356225. Conclusions: Treatment with SRDs and MRDs of BI 1356225 was well tolerated by healthy males and subjects with overweight/obesity. BI 1356225 treatment over 28 days reduced AG concentrations and the AG/UAG ratio by >80 %, but no effect was seen on bodyweight, hunger/satiety, control of eating or energy intake. Although, at 4 weeks, the MRD study was fairly short, a reduction in bodyweight would be expected to be evident by this time, suggesting that a reduction of AG via a GOAT inhibitor is not sufficient to induce clinically relevant bodyweight loss.",,"Appetite,Ghrelin,Ghrelin-O-acyltransferase,Pharmacodynamics,Pharmacokinetics,Tolerability",10.1016/j.metabol.2023.155550,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2023.155550

While depressive-related symptoms are well known, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathophysiology and progression remain largely unknown. The gut microbiota (GM) is emerging as a key regulator of the central nervous system homeostasis by exerting fundamental immune and metabolic functions. In turn, the brain influences the intestinal microbial composition through neuroendocrine signals, within the so-called gut microbiota-brain axis. The balance of this bidirectional crosstalk is important to ensure neurogenesis, preserve the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and avoid neuroinflammation. Conversely, dysbiosis and gut permeability negatively affect brain development, behavior, and cognition. Furthermore, although not fully defined yet, changes in the GM composition in depressed patients are reported to influence the pharmacokinetics of common antidepressants by affecting their absorption, metabolism, and activity. Similarly, neuropsychiatric drugs may shape in turn the GM with an impact on the efficacy and toxicity of the pharmacological intervention itself. Consequently, strategies aimed at re-establishing the correct homeostatic gut balance (i.e., prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and dietary interventions) represent an innovative approach to improve the pharmacotherapy of depression. Among these, probiotics and the Mediterranean diet, alone or in combination with the standard of care, hold promise for clinical application. Therefore, the disclosure of the intricate network between GM and depression will give precious insights for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches towards depression, with profound implications for drug development and clinical practice.",,"Depression,Dysbiosis,Gut microbiota-brain axis,Mediterranean diet,Microbiota,Probiotic",10.1016/j.phrs.2023.106799,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2023.106799

Results: 23 studies were included in the final analysis. The study population was dominated by two, large, retrospective, database derived cohorts which included 101,745 patients with cirrhosis. The remaining 21 studies included 2574 patients, including 7 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 293 patients (Table 1). The most frequently assessed intervention was attendance at addiction therapy or alcohol rehabilitation (7 studies). Other interventions were pharmacological (baclofen, acamprosate, naltrexone, faecal transplant), psychological (motivational therapy, educational sessions) and attendance at specialist clinics. Two studies looked generically at the impact of any intervention for AUD. One retrospective cohort examined the impact of using low alcohol drinks. Studies variably reported outcomes related to liver disease (decompensation of cirrhosis, mortality and hospital admissions (n = 6)), alcohol use only (n = 10) or both outcome categories (n = 6). All of the studies which recorded alcohol outcomes reported that the intervention was beneficial in reducing intake or preventing relapse.

"Novel Selective PPARα Modulator Pemafibrate for Dyslipidemia, Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), and Atherosclerosis †",,"Yamashita S., Rizzo M., Su T.-C., Masuda D.",6/1/23,6/6/23,Metabolites (2023) 13:5 Article Number: 626. Date of Publication: 1 May 2023,Metabolites,2023,13,5,,,1-May-23,Review,2218-1989 (electronic),"Statins, the intestinal cholesterol transporter inhibitor (ezetimibe), and PCSK9 inhibitors can reduce serum LDL-C levels, leading to a significant reduction in cardiovascular events. However, these events cannot be fully prevented even when maintaining very low LDL-C levels. Hypertriglyceridemia and reduced HDL-C are known as residual risk factors for ASCVD. Hypertriglyceridemia and/or low HDL-C can be treated with fibrates, nicotinic acids, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fibrates were demonstrated to be PPARα agonists and can markedly lower serum TG levels, yet were reported to cause some adverse effects, including an increase in the liver enzyme and creatinine levels. Recent megatrials of fibrates have shown negative findings on the prevention of ASCVD, which were supposed to be due to their low selectivity and potency for binding to PPAR α. To overcome the off-target effects of fibrates, the concept of a selective PPARα modulator (SPPARMα) was proposed. Kowa Company, Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), has developed pemafibrate (K-877). Compared with fenofibrate, pemafibrate showed more favorable effects on the reduction of TG and an increase in HDL-C. Fibrates worsened liver and kidney function test values, although pemafibrate showed a favorable effect on liver function test values and little effect on serum creatinine levels and eGFR. Minimal drug–drug interactions of pemafibrate with statins were observed. While most of the fibrates are mainly excreted from the kidney, pemafibrate is metabolized in the liver and excreted into the bile. It can be used safely even in patients with CKD, without a significant increase in blood concentration. In the megatrial of pemafibrate, PROMINENT, for dyslipidemic patients with type 2 diabetes, mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL-C and LDL-C levels, the incidence of cardiovascular events did not decrease among those receiving pemafibrate compared to those receiving the placebo; however, the incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was lower. Pemafibrate may be superior to conventional fibrates and applicable to CKD patients. This current review summarizes the recent findings on pemafibrate.",,"dyslipidemia,pemafibrate,PPARα,SPPARMα,triglycerides",10.3390/metabo13050626,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/metabo13050626
Treatment Options for Hepatitis A and E: A Non-Systematic Review,,"Gabrielli F., Alberti F., Russo C., Cursaro C., Seferi H., Margotti M., Andreone P.",6/6/23,6/9/23,Viruses (2023) 15:5 Article Number: 1080. Date of Publication: 1 May 2023,Viruses,2023,15,5,,,1-May-23,Review,1999-4915 (electronic),"Hepatitis A and hepatitis E are relatively common causes of liver disease. Both viruses are mainly transmitted through the faecal–oral route and, consequently, most outbreaks occur in countries with poor sanitation. An important role of the immune response as the driver of liver injury is also shared by the two pathogens. For both the hepatitis A (HAV) and hepatitis E (HEV) viruses, the clinical manifestations of infection mainly consist of an acute disease with mild liver injury, which results in clinical and laboratory alterations that are self-limiting in most cases. However, severe acute disease or chronic, long-lasting manifestations may occur in vulnerable patients, such as pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals or those with pre-existing liver disease. Specifically, HAV infection rarely results in fulminant hepatitis, prolonged cholestasis, relapsing hepatitis and possibly autoimmune hepatitis triggered by the viral infection. Less common manifestations of HEV include extrahepatic disease, acute liver failure and chronic HEV infection with persistent viraemia. In this paper, we conduct a non-systematic review of the available literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of the state of the art. Treatment mainly consists of supportive measures, while the available evidence for aetiological treatment and additional agents in severe disease is limited in quantity and quality. However, several therapeutic approaches have been attempted: for HAV infection, corticosteroid therapy has shown outcome improvement, and molecules, such as AZD 1480, zinc chloride and heme oxygenase-1, have demonstrated a reduction in viral replication in vitro. As for HEV infection, therapeutic options mainly rely on the use of ribavirin, and some studies utilising pegylated interferon-alpha have shown conflicting results. While a vaccine for HAV is already available and has led to a significant reduction in the prevalence of the disease, several vaccines for HEV are currently being developed, with some already available in China, showing promising results.",,"antiviral therapy,HAV,hepatitis A virus,hepatitis E virus,HEV,ribavirin,treatment,vaccines",10.3390/v15051080,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v15051080
Antidiarrheal Properties of the Combination of Tannin Albuminate and Ethacridine Lactate - A Narrative Review,,"Salama-Müller A., Roese N.",6/13/23,9/5/23,Natural Product Communications (2023) 18:5.

Design: Narrative review. Data sources: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and Embase from inception to September 2022. The search was restricted to English and German language publications. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Randomized controlled trials, non-interventional studies, and meta-analyses assessing tannin and/or ethacridine for the treatment or prevention of diarrhea. Results: Of 366 titles identified, a total of 13 studies were included in this review. Five randomized controlled trials and four noninterventional trials demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the fixed combination of tannin albuminate and ethacridine lactate monohydrate in treating acute diarrhea and preventing traveler's diarrhea. The fixed combination reduced acute diarrhea duration by improving stool frequency, consistency, and weight and reduced the risk of traveler's diarrhea. Two pilot studies indicate efficacy in chronic diarrhea. Safety and tolerability were very good in all included studies. Two meta-analyses investigated the efficacy of gelatin tannate in children with acute gastroenteritis. Conclusion: The efficacy and safety of tannin albuminate and ethacridine lactate monohydrate for the treatment of acute diarrhea and the prevention of traveler's diarrhea are proven in randomized controlled trials. Several noninterventional studies substantiate the real-world effectiveness and tolerability of the fixed combination. Both active ingredients combine antidiarrheal, antimicrobial, mucosal protection, and spasmolytic properties. However, existing clinical data should be updated with larger, well-designed, placebo-controlled trials in adult and pediatric patient populations.",,"astringency,diarrhea,ethacridine,gastroenteritis,mucosal protection,phenolics,tannin albuminate,tannins",10.1177/1934578X231170998,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1934578X231170998
"Biosecurity and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions in animal agricultural settings for reducing infection burden, antibiotic use, and antibiotic resistance: a One Health systematic review",,"Jimenez C.E.P., Keestra S., Tandon P., Cumming O., Pickering A.J., Moodley A., Chandler C.I.R.",5/12/23,7/25/23,The Lancet Planetary Health (2023) 7:5 (e418-e434).

Evidence for how best to manage these risks in agricultural communities—45% of households globally—has not been systematically assembled. This systematic review identifies and summarises evidence from on-farm biosecurity and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions with the potential to directly or indirectly reduce infections and antibiotic resistance in animal agricultural settings. We searched 17 scientific databases (including Web of Science, PubMed, and regional databases) and grey literature from database inception to Dec 31, 2019 for articles that assessed biosecurity or WASH interventions measuring our outcomes of interest; namely, infection burden, microbial loads, antibiotic use, and antibiotic resistance in animals, humans, or the environment. Risk of bias was assessed with the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation tool, Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions, and the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies, although no studies were excluded as a result. Due to the heterogeneity of interventions found, we conducted a narrative synthesis. The protocol was pre-registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020162345). Of the 20 672 publications screened, 104 were included in this systematic review. 64 studies were conducted in high-income countries, 24 studies in upper-middle-income countries, 13 studies in lower-middle-income countries, two in low-income countries, and one included both upper-middle-income countries and lower-middle-income countries. 48 interventions focused on livestock (mainly pigs), 43 poultry (mainly chickens), one on livestock and poultry, and 12 on aquaculture farms. 68 of 104 interventions took place on intensive farms, 22 in experimental settings, and ten in smallholder or subsistence farms. Positive outcomes were reported for ten of 23 water studies, 17 of 35 hygiene studies, 15 of 24 sanitation studies, all three air-quality studies, and 11 of 17 other biosecurity-related interventions. In total, 18 of 26 studies reported reduced infection or diseases, 37 of 71 studies reported reduced microbial loads, four of five studies reported reduced antibiotic use, and seven of 20 studies reported reduced antibiotic resistance. Overall, risk of bias was high in 28 of 57 studies with positive interventions and 17 of 30 studies with negative or neutral interventions. Farm-management interventions successfully reduced antibiotic use by up to 57%. Manure-oriented interventions reduced antibiotic resistance genes or antibiotic-resistant bacteria in animal waste by up to 99%. This systematic review highlights the challenges of preventing and controlling infections and antimicrobial resistance, even in well resourced agricultural settings. Most of the evidence emerges from studies that focus on the farm itself, rather than targeting agricultural communities or the broader social, economic, and policy environment that could affect their outcomes. WASH and biosecurity interventions could complement each other when addressing antimicrobial resistance in the human, animal, and environmental interface.",,,10.1016/S2542-5196(23)00049-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2542-5196(23)00049-9
Fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile (Clostridium difficile),,"Minkoff N.Z., Aslam S., Medina M., Tanner-Smith E.E., Zackular J.P., Acra S., Nicholson M.R., Imdad A.",5/3/23,7/18/23,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023) 2023:4 Article Number: CD013871. Date of Publication: 25 Apr 2023,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2023,2023,4,,,25-Apr-23,Article,1465-1858,"Background: Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) is a bacterium that can cause potentially life-threatening diarrheal illness in individuals with an unhealthy mixture of gut bacteria, known as dysbiosis, and can cause recurrent infections in nearly a third of infected individuals. The traditional treatment of recurrent C difficile infection (rCDI) includes antibiotics, which may further exacerbate dysbiosis. There is growing interest in correcting the underlying dysbiosis in rCDI using of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT); and there is a need to establish the benefits and harms of FMT for the treatment of rCDI based on data from randomized controlled trials. Objectives: To evaluate the benefits and harms of donor-based fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in immunocompetent people. Search methods: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 31 March 2022. Selection criteria: We considered randomized trials of adults or children with rCDI for inclusion. Eligible interventions must have met the definition of FMT, which is the administration of fecal material containing distal gut microbiota from a healthy donor to the gastrointestinal tract of a person with rCDI. The comparison group included participants who did not receive FMT and were given placebo, autologous FMT, no intervention, or antibiotics with activity against C difficile. Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. proportion of participants with resolution of rCDI and 2. serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 3. treatment failure, 4. all-cause mortality, 5. withdrawal from study, 6. rate of new CDI infection after a successful FMT, 7. any adverse event, 8. quality of life, and 9. colectomy. We used the GRADE criteria to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. Main results: We included six studies with 320 participants. Two studies were conducted in Denmark, and one each in the Netherlands, Canada, Italy, and the US. Four were single-center and two were multicenter studies. All studies included only adults. Five studies excluded people who were severely immunocompromised, with only one study including 10 participants who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy out of the 64 enrolled; these were similarly distributed between the FMT arm (4/24 or 17%) and comparison arms (6/40 or 15%). The route of administration was the upper gastrointestinal tract via a nasoduodenal tube in one study, two studies used enema only, two used colonoscopic only delivery, and one used either nasojejunal or colonoscopic delivery, depending on a clinical determination of whether the recipient could tolerate a colonoscopy. Five studies had at least one comparison group that received vancomycin. The risk of bias (RoB 2) assessments did not find an overall high risk of bias for any outcome. All six studies assessed the efficacy and safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Pooled results from six studies showed that the use of FMT in immunocompetent participants with rCDI likely leads to a large increase in resolution of rCDI in the FMT group compared to control (risk ratio (RR) 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.71; P = 0.02, I(2) = 63%; 6 studies, 320 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3; moderate-certainty evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation probably results in a slight reduction in serious adverse events; however, the CIs around the summary estimate were wide (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.41; P = 0.24, I² = 26%; 6 studies, 320 participants; NNTB 12; moderate-certainty evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation may result in a reduction in all-cause mortality; however, the number of events was small, and the CIs of the summary estimate were wide (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.45; P = 0.48, I(2) = 0%; 6 studies, 320 participants; NNTB 20; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported colectomy rates. Authors' conclusions: In immunocompetent adults with rCDI, FMT likely leads to a large increase in the resolution of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection compared to alternative treatments such as antibiotics. There was no conclusive evidence regarding the safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI as the number of events was small for serious adverse events and all-cause mortality. Additional data from large national registry databases might be required to assess any short-term or long-term risks with using FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Elimination of the single study that included some immunocompromised people did not alter these conclusions. Due to the low number of immunocompromised participants enrolled, conclusions cannot be drawn about the risks or benefits of FMT for rCDI in the immunocompromised population.",,,10.1002/14651858.CD013871.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013871.pub2

The protracted nature of the development and progression of CVD motivates the identification of early and complementary targets that might explain and alleviate any residual risk in treated patients. The gut microbiota has emerged as a sentinel between our inner milieu and outer environment and relays a modified risk associated with these factors to the host. Accordingly, numerous mechanistic studies in animal models support a causal role of the gut microbiome in CVD via specific microbial or shared microbiota–host metabolites and have identified converging mammalian targets for these signals. Similarly, large-scale cohort studies have repeatedly reported perturbations of the gut microbial community in CVD, supporting the translational potential of targeting this ecological niche, but the move from bench to bedside has not been smooth. In this Review, we provide an overview of the current evidence on the interconnectedness of the gut microbiome and CVD against the noisy backdrop of highly prevalent confounders in advanced CVD, such as increased metabolic burden and polypharmacy. We further aim to conceptualize the molecular mechanisms at the centre of these associations and identify actionable gut microbiome-based targets, while contextualizing the current knowledge within the clinical scenario and emphasizing the limitations of the field that need to be overcome.",,,10.1038/s41569-022-00771-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41569-022-00771-0

The holistic approach considers the interlink between T2DM and its complications, finding the best therapies for minimizing the cardiovascular (CV) or renal risk and benefitting from the treatment‘s pleiotropic effects. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) fit best in the holistic approach because of their effects in reducing the risk of CV events and obtaining better metabolic control. Additionally, research on the SGLT-2i and GLP-1 RA modification of gut microbiota is accumulating. The microbiota plays a significant role in the relation between diet and CV disease because some intestinal bacteria lead to an increase in short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and consequent positive effects. Thus, our review aims to describe the relation between antidiabetic non-insulin therapy (SGLT-2i and GLP-1 RA) with CV-proven benefits and the gut microbiota in patients with T2DM. We identified five randomized clinical trials including dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, liraglutide, and loxenatide, with different results. There were differences between empagliflozin and metformin regarding the effects on microbiota despite similar glucose control in both study groups. One study demonstrated that liraglutide induced gut microbiota alterations in patients with T2DM treated initially with metformin, but another failed to detect any differences when the same molecule was compared with sitagliptin. The established CV and renal protection that the SGLT-2i and GLP-1 RA exert could be partly due to their action on gut microbiota. The individual and cumulative effects of antidiabetic drugs on gut microbiota need further research.",,"GLP-1 RA,holistic approach,microbiota,SGLT-2i,type 2 diabetes mellitus",10.3390/ijms24087184,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms24087184

The microbiota of the human body undergoes disruptions in critical illness, in part due to alterations in physiology but also as the result of medical interventions, most notably antimicrobial drug administration. These alterations may lead to a significant dysbiosis, with increased risks of multi-drug-resistant organism-based secondary infections, Clostridioides difficile promotion, and other infection-related complications. Antimicrobial stewardship is a process that seeks to optimize antimicrobial drug prescription, with recent evidence emphasizing shorter courses of therapy, earlier transitions from empiric to pathogen-specific regimens, and enhanced diagnostic testing. Through a combination of prudent stewardship and wise use of diagnostic testing, clinicians can improve outcomes, reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance, and help improve the integrity of the microbiome.",,"antimicrobial resistance,antimicrobial stewardship,microbiome",10.1089/sur.2022.422,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/sur.2022.422

However, current estimates of the health impacts of WASH interventions use self-reported morbidity, which may fail to capture longer-term or more severe impacts. Reported mortality is thought to be less prone to bias than other reported measures. This study aimed to answer the question: What are the impacts of WASH interventions on reported childhood mortality in L&MICs? Methods and findings We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, using a published protocol. Systematic searches of 11 academic databases and trial registries, plus organisational repositories, were undertaken to locate studies of WASH interventions, which were published in peer review journals or other sources (e.g., organisational reports and working papers). Intervention studies of WASH improvements implemented under endemic disease circumstances in L&MICs were eligible, which reported findings at any time until March 2020. We used the participant flow data supplied in response to journal editors' calls for greater transparency. Data were collected by two authors working independently. We included evidence from 24 randomized and 11 nonrandomized studies of WASH interventions from all global regions, incorporating 2, 600 deaths. Effects of 48 WASH treatment arms were included in analysis. We critically appraised and synthesised evidence using meta-analysis to improve statistical power. We found WASH interventions are associated with a significant reduction of 17% in the odds of all-cause mortality in childhood (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.74, 0.92, evidence from 38 interventions), and a significant reduction in diarrhoea mortality of 45% (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.35, 0.84; 10 interventions). Further analysis by WASH technology indicated interventions providing improved water in quantity to households were most consistently associated with reductions in all-cause mortality. Community-wide sanitation was most consistently associated with reductions in diarrhoea mortality. Around one-half of the included studies were assessed as being at “moderate risk of bias” in attributing mortality in childhood to the WASH intervention, and no studies were found to be at “low risk of bias.” The review should be updated to incorporate additional published and unpublished participant flow data. Conclusions The findings are congruent with theories of infectious disease transmission. Washing with water presents a barrier to respiratory illness and diarrhoea, which are the two biggest contributors to all-cause mortality in childhood in L&MICs. Community-wide sanitation halts the spread of diarrhoea.

However, little is known about how improved WASH practices and behaviors and OCV interact to reduce the risk of cholera. We reanalyzed two arms of a cluster-randomized trial in urban Bangladesh, to evaluate the effectiveness of OCV given as a 2-dose regimen. One arm (30 clusters, n = 94,675) was randomized to vaccination of persons aged one year and older with OCV, and the other arm (30 clusters, n = 80,056) to no intervention. We evaluated the prevention of cholera by household WASH, classified at baseline using a previously validated rule, and OCV over 2 years of follow-up. When analyzed by assignment to OCV clusters rather than receipt of OCV, in comparison to persons living in “Not Better WASH” households in the control clusters, reduction of severe cholera (the primary outcome) was similar for persons in “Not Better WASH” households in vaccine clusters (46%, 95% CI:24,62), for persons in “Better WASH” households in the control clusters (48%, 95% CI:25,64), and for persons in “Better WASH” households in the vaccine clusters (48%, 95% CI:16,67). In contrast, when analyzed by actual receipt of a complete OCV regimen, in comparison to persons in “Not Better WASH” households in the control clusters, protection against severe cholera increased steadily from 39% (95% CI:13,58) in residents of “Better WASH” households in the control clusters to 57% (95% CI:35,72) in vaccinated persons in “Not Better WASH” households to 63% (95% CI:21,83) in vaccinated persons in “Better WASH” households. This analysis suggests that improved household WASH and OCV received may interact to provide greater protection against cholera.

The evidence from systematic reviews, however, is limited. Objective: Evidence from randomized controlled trials testing oral consumption of fermented-milk kefir on any outcome of human health or disease. Data Sources: A systematic search of 4 electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and Cochrane Trials) from inception to July 31, 2021, was conducted. Data Extraction: Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessments were conducted by 2 reviewers independently. Data Analysis: A total of 18 publications reporting the results of 16 studies were included. Per the narrative analysis, fermented-milk kefir may have potential as a complementary therapy in reducing oral Streptococcus mutans, thereby reducing dental caries risk, and in Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. Kefir may further aid treatment of adult dyslipidemia and hypertension, although evidence was very limited.

Berberine as a Natural Modifier of Gut Microbiota to Promote Metabolic Status in Animal Studies and Clinical Trials: A Systematic Review,,"Adel-Mehraban M.S., Aghabeiglooei Z., Atlasi R., Namazi N., Ayati M.H.",12/14/23,12/18/23,Traditional and Integrative Medicine (2023) 8:2 (202-216).

However, findings are conflicting. In the present systematic review, we aimed to summarize the effects of berberine on gut microbiota in the models of metabolic disorders in both animal studies and clinical trials. Publications in five electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched systematically up to 31 May 2021 to find relevant articles with English language. Out of 4102 studies (including 2125 duplicates), 35 studies were included. In animal studies, various effects of berberine on beneficial and harmful microbiota were reported. However, findings also indicated that berberine can decrease the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio. Three out of five studies showed positive effects of berberine on the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), particularly butyrate. In three animal studies, lipopolysacaride (LPS) concentrations decreased with berberine administration. In clinical trials (n=3) positive effects on microbiota and metabolic status were also reported. However, the quality of clinical trials was mainly low. The present systematic review showed that berberine can modulate key metabolic parameters through improving the balance of intestinal microbiome, decreasing the abundance of harmful microbiota and LPS concentrations, and increasing the production of SCFAs, particularly butyrate in animal models. However, there are limited high-quality evidence regarding the effects of berberine on gut flora in clinical trials. Although berberine can be an effective prebiotic supplement to modulate metabolic parameters, further high-quality clinical trials are needed to confirm this potential.",,"Berberine,Gut flora,Metabolic status,Systematic review",10.18502/tim.v8i2.13086,http://dx.doi.org/10.18502/tim.v8i2.13086
Preoperative combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation for preventing complications in elective colorectal surgery,,"Willis M.A., Toews I., Soltau S.L.V., Kalff J.C., Meerpohl J.J., Vilz T.O.",2/21/23,2/27/23,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023) 2023:2 Article Number: CD014909. Date of Publication: 7 Feb 2023,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2023,2023,2,,,7-Feb-23,Article,1465-1858,"Background: The success of elective colorectal surgery is mainly influenced by the surgical procedure and postoperative complications. The most serious complications include anastomotic leakages and surgical site infections (SSI)s, which can lead to prolonged recovery with impaired long-term health. Compared with other abdominal procedures, colorectal resections have an increased risk of adverse events due to the physiological bacterial colonisation of the large bowel. Preoperative bowel preparation is used to remove faeces from the bowel lumen and reduce bacterial colonisation. This bowel preparation can be performed mechanically and/or with oral antibiotics. While mechanical bowel preparation alone is not beneficial, the benefits and harms of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation is still unclear. Objectives: To assess the evidence for the use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation for preventing complications in elective colorectal surgery. Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL and trial registries on 15 December 2021. In addition, we searched reference lists and contacted colorectal surgery organisations. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adult participants undergoing elective colorectal surgery comparing combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation (MBP+oAB) with either MBP alone, oAB alone, or no bowel preparation (nBP). We excluded studies in which no perioperative intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis was given. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. Pooled results were reported as mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) using the Mantel-Haenszel method. The certainty of the evidence was assessed with GRADE. Main results: We included 21 RCTs analysing 5264 participants who underwent elective colorectal surgery. None of the included studies had a high risk of bias, but two-thirds of the included studies raised some concerns. This was mainly due to the lack of a predefined analysis plan or missing information about the randomisation process. Most included studies investigated both colon and rectal resections due to malignant and benign surgical indications. For MBP as well as oAB, the included studies used different regimens in terms of agent(s), dosage and timing. Data for all predefined outcomes could be extracted from the included studies. However, only four studies reported on side effects of bowel preparation, and none recorded the occurrence of adverse effects such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances or the need to discontinue the intervention due to side effects. Seventeen trials compared MBP+oAB with sole MBP.The incidence of SSI could be reduced through MBP+oAB by 44% (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.74; 3917 participants from 16 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and the risk of anastomotic leakage could be reduced by 40% (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.99; 2356 participants from 10 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). No difference between the two comparison groups was found with regard to mortality (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.82; 639 participants from 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), the incidence of postoperative ileus (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.32; 2013 participants from 6 studies, low-certainty of evidence) and length of hospital stay (MD -0.19, 95% CI -1.81 to 1.44; 621 participants from 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Three trials compared MBP+oAB with sole oAB.No difference was demonstrated between the two treatment alternatives in terms of SSI (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.21; 960 participants from 3 studies; very low-certainty evidence), anastomotic leakage (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.45; 960 participants from 3 studies; low-certainty evidence), mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.50; 709 participants from 2 studies; low-certainty evidence), incidence of postoperative ileus (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.33; 709 participants from 2 studies; low-certainty evidence) or length of hospital stay (MD 0.1 respectively 0.2, 95% CI -0.68 to 1.08; data from 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial (396 participants) compared MBP+oAB versus nBP. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of MBP+oAB on the incidence of SSI as well as mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.23 respectively RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.22; low-certainty evidence), while no effect on the risk of anastomotic leakages (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.42; low-certainty evidence), the incidence of postoperative ileus (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.81; low-certainty evidence) or the length of hospital stay (MD 0.1, 95% CI -0.8 to 1; low-certainty evidence) could be demonstrated. Authors' conclusions: Based on moderate-certainty evidence, our results suggest that MBP+oAB is probably more effective than MBP alone in preventing postoperative complications. In particular, with respect to our primary outcomes, SSI and anastomotic leakage, a lower incidence was demonstrated using MBP+oAB. Whether oAB alone is actually equivalent to MBP+oAB, or leads to a reduction or increase in the risk of postoperative complications, cannot be clarified in light of the low- to very low-certainty evidence. Similarly, it remains unclear whether omitting preoperative bowel preparation leads to an increase in the risk of postoperative complications due to limited evidence. Additional RCTs, particularly on the comparisons of MBP+oAB versus oAB alone or nBP, are needed to assess the impact of oAB alone or nBP compared with MBP+oAB on postoperative complications and to improve confidence in the estimated effect. In addition, RCTs focusing on subgroups (e.g. in relation to type and location of colon resections) or reporting side effects of the intervention are needed to determine the most effective approach of preoperative bowel preparation.",,,10.1002/14651858.CD014909.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD014909.pub2

Methods: We searched multiple electronic databases for all publications to 12th October 2020, and RCTs only to 28th June 2021. Two reviewers screened, extracted, and analysed data. We used Cochrane ROB (Risk of Bias)1 for RCTs, ROBINS-I for non-RCTs, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Results: Data from 30 RCTs and 2 non-RCTs showed no overall difference between groups for all-cause mortality and adverse events in four comparisons. Certainty of the evidence was downgraded for high ROB and imprecision. (1) CP versus standard care (SoC) (20 RCTS, 2 non-RCTs, very-low to moderate-high certainty); (2) CP versus biologically active control (6 RCTs, very-low certainty); (3) hIVIG versus SoC (3 RCTs, very-low certainty); (4) early CP versus deferred CP (1 RCT, very-low certainty). Subgrouping by titre improved precision in one outcome (30-day mortality) for the ‘COVID high-titre’ category in Comparison 1 (no difference, high certainty) and Comparison 2 (favours CP, very-low certainty). Post hoc analysis suggests a possible benefit of CP in patients testing negative for antibodies at baseline, compared with those testing positive. Conclusion: A minimum titre should be established and ensured for a positive biological response to the therapy. Further research on the impact of CP/hIVIG in patients who have not yet produced antibodies to the virus would be useful to target therapies at groups who will potentially benefit the most.",,"convalescent,hyper-immune immunoglobulin,infection,plasma,respiratory,safety",10.1111/tme.12942,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tme.12942

Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted up to April 23, 2021, using linezolid and its synonyms as search terms. Two reviewers independently identified and extracted relevant randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies. The extracted studies were included in a single-rate meta-analysis of adverse events and clinical outcomes using random-effects models. Results: A total of 1082 articles were identified, and nine studies involving 758 children were included in the meta-analysis. The overall proportion of adverse events was 8.91% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.64%–36.52%], with diarrhea (2.24%), vomiting (2.05%), and rash (1.72%) being the most common. The incidences of thrombocytopenia and anemia were 0.68% and 0.16%, respectively. Some specific adverse events, including rash and gastrointestinal events, were more frequent in the oral administration subgroup. In terms of efficacy, the overall proportion of clinical improvement was 88.80% (95% CI = 81.31%–93.52%). Children with a history of specific bacteriological diagnosis or concomitant antibiotic therapy had a 1.13-fold higher clinical improvement than children without such histories.

It is a resource-intensive method that also carries some procedural risks and whose effects are not always reproducible. This review summarizes the current knowledge on FMT to treat metabolic diseases and gives an outlook on open research questions. Further research is undoubtedly required to find applications that are less resource-intensive, such as oral encapsulated formulations, and have strong and predictable results.

Although the incidence of melanoma has continued to rise, median survival has improved from approximately 6 months to nearly 6 years for patients with advanced inoperable stage IV disease. Recent understanding of the tumor microenvironment and its interplay with the immune system has led to the explosive development of novel immunotherapy treatments. Since the approval of the therapeutic cytokines interleukin-2 and interferon alfa-2 in the 1990s, the development of novel immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), oncolytic virus therapy, and modulators of the tumor microenvironment have given way to a new era in melanoma treatment. Monoclonal antibodies directed at programmed cell death protein 1 receptor (PD-1) and its ligand (PDL-1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) have provided robust activation of the adaptive immune system, restoring immune surveillance leading to host tumor recognition and destruction. Multiple other immunomodulatory therapeutics are under investigation to overcome resistance to ICI therapy, including the toll-like receptor-9 (TLR-9) and 7/8 (TLR-7/8) agonists, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists, and fecal microbiota transplantation.

The available evidence on diagnosis, pathophysiology and risk factors, prevention and treatment of POR was reviewed and unanswered research questions were listed Results: In recent years, surgeons have been utilising innovative surgical techniques to reduce POR. Whilst the side-to-side anastomosis has become more common, the benefits of newer procedures such as Kono-S anastomosis or over-the-valve strictureplasty remain unproven Consistency in describing and reporting POR is crucial both in routine practice and in clinical research. Ileocolonoscopy six to twelve months after ileocolonic anastomosis remains the gold standard to diagnose POR However, an effort to adapt the Rutgeerts score to surgical techniques different from end-to-end anastomosis is required. Significance of isolated ulcers of the anastomotic line, specifically in case of stapled anastomoses, is still debated. In the coming years, intestinal ultrasound combined to faecal calprotectin may ultimately decrease the reliance on ileocolonoscopy Research on the microbiome and genetic background of patients with POR is promising although not applicable in daily clinical practice yet Smoking is the only risk factor clearly identified in POR, whereas previous ileocolonic resection or penetrating disease have not been validated in prospective studies. Stronger emphasis on smoking cessation for all patients should include specific active measures to make it successful The prevailing gap in accurate predictors of POR disempowers clinicians from stratifying between systematic prophylaxis and endoscopy-driven approach. Immediate prophylaxis therapy may lead to overtreatment Ongoing randomized controlled trials comparing (i) systematic prophylaxis and endoscopy-guided introduction of biological therapy (NCT05169593), and (ii) therapy escalation to status quo in patients with moderate endoscopic POR (NCT05072782) should be informative Conclusion: Despite important progress in the field of POR in the last 30 years, POR management remains a challenge. The IBD community should strive to optimise diagnostic procedures of POR including ileocolonoscopy and non-invasive techniques, define patients at high risk of POR using microbiome and/or genetic profiling and clarify the optimal medical treatment strategy after surgery.",,,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjac190.0013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjac190.0013

Infections by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) have become a major challenge in the management of cirrhotic patients with significant prognostic and cost-related impact. About one third of cirrhotic patients with bacterial infections is infected with MDR bacteria and their prevalence has increased in recent years. MDR infections have a worse prognosis compared to infections by non-resistant bacteria because they are associated with lower rate of infection resolution. An adequate management of cirrhotic patients with infections caused by MDR bacteria depends on the knowledge of some epidemiological aspects, such as the type of infection (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection and spontaneous bacteremia), bacteriological profile of antibiotic resistance at each health care unit and site of infection acquisition (community acquired, healthcare associated or nosocomial). Furthermore, regional variations in the prevalence of MDR infections determine that the choice of empirical antibiotic therapy must be adapted to the local microbiological epidemiology. Antibiotic treatment is the most effective measure to treat infections caused by MDRO. Therefore, optimizing antibiotic prescribing is critical to effectively treat these infections. Identification of risk factors for multidrug resistance is essential to define the best antibiotic treatment strategy in each case and the choice of an effective empirical antibiotic therapy and its early administration is cardinal to reduce mortality. On the other hand, the supply of new agents to treat these infections is very limited. Thus, specific protocols that include preventive measures must be implemented in order to limit the negative impact of this severe complication in cirrhotic patients.",,"Antibiotics,Bacterial,Cirrhosis,Infection,Microbiota,Multidrug-resistance",10.12998/wjcc.v11.i3.534,http://dx.doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v11.i3.534
Interventions to improve sanitation for preventing diarrhoea,,"Bauza V., Ye W., Liao J., Majorin F., Clasen T.",2/7/23,4/18/23,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023) 2023:1 Article Number: CD013328. Date of Publication: 25 Jan 2023,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2023,2023,1,,,25-Jan-23,Article,1465-1858,"Background: Diarrhoea is a major contributor to the global disease burden, particularly amongst children under five years in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). As many of the infectious agents associated with diarrhoea are transmitted through faeces, sanitation interventions to safely contain and manage human faeces have the potential to reduce exposure and diarrhoeal disease. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of sanitation interventions for preventing diarrhoeal disease, alone or in combination with other WASH interventions. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Chinese language databases available under the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI-CAJ). We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and conference proceedings, contacted researchers, and searched references of included studies. The last search date was 16 February 2022. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs), and matched cohort studies of interventions aimed at introducing or expanding the coverage and/or use of sanitation facilities in children and adults in any country or population. Our primary outcome of interest was diarrhoea and secondary outcomes included dysentery (bloody diarrhoea), persistent diarrhoea, hospital or clinical visits for diarrhoea, mortality, and adverse events. We included sanitation interventions whether they were conducted independently or in combination with other interventions. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed eligible studies, extracted relevant data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used meta-analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect, described results narratively, and investigated potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses. Main results: Fifty-one studies met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 238,535 participants. Of these, 50 studies had sufficient information to be included in quantitative meta-analysis, including 17 cluster-RCTs and 33 studies with non-randomized study designs (20 NRCTs, one CBA, and 12 matched cohort studies). Most were conducted in LMICs and 86% were conducted in whole or part in rural areas. Studies covered three broad types of interventions: (1) providing access to any sanitation facility to participants without existing access practising open defecation, (2) improving participants' existing sanitation facility, or (3) behaviour change messaging to improve sanitation access or practices without providing hardware or subsidy, although many studies overlapped multiple categories. There was substantial heterogeneity amongst individual study results for all types of interventions. Providing access to any sanitation facility. Providing access to sanitation facilities was evaluated in seven cluster-RCTs, and may reduce diarrhoea prevalence in all age groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.08; 7 trials, 40,129 participants, low-certainty evidence). In children under five years, access may have little or no effect on diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16, 4 trials, 16,215 participants, low-certainty evidence). Additional analysis in non-randomized studies was generally consistent with these findings. Pooled estimates across randomized and non-randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94; 15 studies, 73,511 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02; 11 studies, 25,614 participants). Sanitation facility improvement. Interventions designed to improve existing sanitation facilities were evaluated in three cluster-RCTs in children under five and may reduce diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.06; 3 trials, 14,900 participants, low-certainty evidence). However, some of these interventions, such as sewerage connection, are not easily randomized. Non-randomized studies across participants of all ages provided estimates that improving sanitation facilities may reduce diarrhoea, but may be subject to confounding (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.74; 23 studies, 117,639 participants, low-certainty evidence). Pooled estimates across randomized and non-randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.78; 26 studies, 132,539 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.91, 12 studies, 23,353 participants). Behaviour change messaging only (no hardware or subsidy provided). Strategies to promote behaviour change to construct, upgrade, or use sanitation facilities were evaluated in seven cluster-RCTs in children under five, and probably reduce diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; 7 studies, 28,909 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Additional analysis from two non-randomized studies found no effect, though with very high uncertainty. Pooled estimates across randomized and non-randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; 9 studies, 31,080 participants). No studies measured the effects of this type of intervention in older populations. Any sanitation intervention. A pooled analysis of cluster-RCTs across all sanitation interventions demonstrated that the interventions may reduce diarrhoea prevalence in all ages (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95, 17 trials, 83,938 participants, low-certainty evidence) and children under five (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97; 14 trials, 60,024 participants, low-certainty evidence). Non-randomized comparisons also demonstrated a protective effect, but may be subject to confounding. Pooled estimates across randomized and non-randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.82; 50 studies, 237,130 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89; 32 studies, 80,047 participants). In subgroup analysis, there was some evidence of larger effects in studies with increased coverage amongst all participants (75% or higher coverage levels) and also some evidence that the effect decreased over longer follow-up times for children under five years. There was limited evidence on other outcomes. However, there was some evidence that any sanitation intervention was protective against dysentery (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.00; 5 studies, 34,025 participants) and persistent diarrhoea (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.75; 2 studies, 2665 participants), but not against clinic visits for diarrhoea (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.67; 2 studies, 3720 participants) or all-cause mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89 to1.09; 7 studies, 46,123 participants). Authors' conclusions: There is evidence that sanitation interventions are effective at preventing diarrhoea, both for young children and all age populations. The actual level of effectiveness, however, varies by type of intervention and setting. There is a need for research to better understand the factors that influence effectiveness.",,,10.1002/14651858.CD013328.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013328.pub2

Date of Publication: 24 Jan 2023,Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,2023,13,,,,24-Jan-23,Review,2235-2988 (electronic),"The intracellular protozoan parasite of the genus Cryptosporidium is among the leading causes of waterborne diarrheal disease outbreaks throughout the world. The parasite is transmitted by ingestion of infective oocysts that are highly stable in the environment and resistant to almost all conventional disinfection methods and water treatments. Control of the parasite infection is exceedingly difficult due to the excretion of large numbers of oocysts in the feces of infected individuals that contaminate the environment and serve as a source of infection for susceptible hosts including humans and animals. Drug development against the parasite is challenging owing to its limited genetic tractability, absence of conventional drug targets, unique intracellular location within the host, and the paucity of robust cell culture platforms for continuous parasite propagation. Despite the high prevalence of the parasite, the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment of Cryptosporidium infections is nitazoxanide, which has shown moderate efficacy in immunocompetent patients. More importantly, no effective therapeutic drugs are available for treating severe, potentially life-threatening cryptosporidiosis in immunodeficient patients, young children, and neonatal livestock. Thus, safe, inexpensive, and efficacious drugs are urgently required to reduce the ever-increasing global cryptosporidiosis burden especially in low-resource countries. Several compounds have been tested for both in vitro and in vivo efficacy against the disease. However, to date, only a few experimental compounds have been subjected to clinical trials in natural hosts, and among those none have proven efficacious. This review provides an overview of the past and present anti-Cryptosporidium pharmacotherapy in humans and agricultural animals. Herein, we also highlight the progress made in the field over the last few years and discuss the different strategies employed for discovery and development of effective prospective treatments for cryptosporidiosis.",,"cryptosporidiosis,Cryptosporidium,diarrhea,drug discovery,prevention,protozoa,treatment",10.3389/fcimb.2023.1115522,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2023.1115522

Treatment is complex, since antibiotics constitute both the main treatment and the major risk factor for infection. Worryingly, resistance to multiple antibiotics is becoming increasingly widespread, leading to the classification of this pathogen as an urgent threat to global health. As a consummate opportunist, C. difficile is well equipped for promoting disease, owing to its arsenal of virulence factors: transmission of this anaerobe is highly efficient due to the formation of robust endospores, and an array of adhesins promote gut colonization. C. difficile produces multiple toxins acting upon gut epithelia, resulting in manifestations typical of diarrheal disease, and severe inflammation in a subset of patients.

Results: There were 32 studies (one randomized controlled trial [RCT], one non-randomized trial, 3 observational, 9 in vitro, and 18 animal in vivo studies) included. In preclinical studies, buckwheat extracts were observed to have cytotoxic potential against human-derived GI cancer cell lines. Animals fed with buckwheat had lower GI mucosal inflammation, higher alpha diversity in the GI microbiome, and higher levels of fecal short-chain fatty acids. Human evidence studies and clinical trials were limited and predominantly of moderate risk of bias. The majority of in vitro studies with GI-derived samples and in vivo studies were reliable without restrictions in study design.

Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2023,Phytomedicine,2023,108,,,,1-Jan-23,Article,"1618-095X (electronic),0944-7113","Background: Ophiocordyceps sinensis (OS), a medicinal fungus, has been made into OS preparations, which are frequently used as adjunctive therapy for patients with Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) in China. It is necessary to assess the efficacy and safety of OS preparations in the adjunctive treatment of DKD by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. Objective: Ophiocordyceps sinensis preparations were evaluated for their efficacy and safety as adjunctive therapy to conventional drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)) for DKD. Methods: We searched seven electronic literature databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ACEI/ARB and OS combined with ACEI/ARB from inception up to March 2022. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias independently. Evidence certainty was rated using the GRADE system. Standardized mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) was pooled with random effects models and was reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis and Egger's test were performed using R software (version 14.2) (PROSPERO registration no. CRD42021248634). Results: Thirty eight RCTs involving 3167 patients met the inclusion criteria. No trials were reported with outcomes about kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events. In meta-analysis, compared with the control group of ACEI/ARB alone, OS combined with ACEI/ARB can achieve better effects in the treatment of DKD on reducing serum creatinine (Scr) [MD(Scr) =-11.48 95% CI [-15.78, -7.18], p < 0.01], blood urea nitrogen (BUN) [MD(BUN)= -1.00, 95% CI [-1.44, -0.55], p < 0.01], β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) [SMD(β2)(−)(MG)= -1.32, 95% CI [-2.27, -0.37], p < 0.01], cystatin C (CysC) [MD(CysC)=-0.64, 95% CI [-0.83, -0.45], p < 0.01], 24-h urine proteinuria (24hUP) [SMD(24hUP)= -1.99, 95% CI [-2.68; -1.31], p < 0.01], urine microalbumin (UALB) [MD(UALB)= -37.41, 95% CI [-44.76, -30.06], p < 0.01] and decreasing urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) [MD(UAER)= -24.11, 95% CI [-30.54, -17.68], p < 0.01] and albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) [SMD(ACR) = 1.01, 95% CI [-1.73, -0.29], p < 0.01]. The OS adjuvant treatment also improved outcomes of blood pressure, blood glucose, blood lipid, inflammation and oxidative stress. No significant change in fasting blood glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), malondialdehyde (MDA), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) was detected. Yet, no significant difference was found about the adverse events between the two groups. Conclusions: Ophiocordyceps sinensis preparation combined with ACEI/ARB has beneficial influence on renal function, decrease proteinuria, dyslipidemia, and even oxidative stress and inflammation in DKD patients.

The disruption of gut microbiota and host immunity in early life is linked to the development of immune-related and metabolic disorders later in life. Antibiotic administration in populations predisposed to gut microbiota dysbiosis, such as newborns, obese children, and children with allergic rhinitis and recurrent infections; changes microbial composition and diversity; exacerbating dysbiosis and resulting in negative health outcomes. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), Clostridiodes difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), and Helicobacter pylori infection are all short-term consequences of antibiotic treatment that persist from a few weeks to months. Changes in gut microbiota, which persist even 2 years after antibiotic exposure, and the development of obesity, allergies, and asthma are among the long-term consequences. Probiotic bacteria and dietary supplements can potentially prevent or reverse antibiotic-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis. Probiotics have been demonstrated in clinical studies to help prevent AAD and, to a lesser extent, CDAD, as well as to improve H pylori eradication rates. In the Indian setting, probiotics (Saccharomyces boulardii and Bacillus clausii) have been shown to reduce the duration and frequency of acute diarrhea in children. Antibiotics may exaggerate the consequences of gut microbiota dysbiosis in vulnerable populations already affected by the condition.

Obesity facilitates the onset of insulin resistance, lipidic abnormalities, hepatic fat accumulation, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and inflammation, all related to further steatosis progression and fibrosis. Microbiota alterations can also influence liver disease by the translocation of pathogenic bacteria, energy extraction from short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), intestinal suppression of the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), reduction of bile acids, and altered choline metabolism. There are also genetic polymorphisms in metabolic proteins that predispose to a higher risk of liver diseases, such as those found in the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3), transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2), membrane-bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing 7 (MBOAT7) or also known as lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase 1 (LPIAT1), transmembrane channel-like 4 genes (TMC4), fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), the b Klotho (KLB) and carboxylesterase (CES1).

The underlying mechanism of depression remain elusive, evidenced by the lack of an appreciate therapy. Recent abundant clinical trials and animal studies support the new notion that the gut microbiota has emerged as a novel actor in the pathophysiology of depression, which partakes in bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain through the neuroendocrine, nervous, and immune signaling pathways, collectively known as the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. Alterations in the gut microbiota can trigger the changes in neurotransmitters, neuroinflammation, and behaviors. With the transition of human microbiome research from studying associations to investigating mechanistic causality, the MGB axis has emerged as a novel therapeutic target in depression and its comorbidities.

The Effects of Immersive Virtual Reality Applications on Enhancing the Learning Outcomes of Undergraduate Health Care Students: Systematic Review With Meta-synthesis,,"Liu J.Y.W., Yin Y.-H., Kor P.P.K., Cheung D.S.K., Zhao I.Y., Wang S., Su J.J., Christensen M., Tyrovolas S., Leung A.Y.M.",4/6/23,6/23/23,Journal of Medical Internet Research (2023) 25 Article Number: e39989. Date of Publication: 2023,Journal of Medical Internet Research,2023,25,,,,2023,Review,1438-8871 (electronic),"Background: Immersive virtual reality (IVR) applications are gaining popularity in health care education. They provide an uninterrupted, scaled environment capable of simulating the full magnitude of sensory stimuli present in busy health care settings and increase students’ competence and confidence by providing them with accessible and repeatable learning opportunities in a fail-safe environment. Objective: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effects of IVR teaching on the learning outcomes and experiences of undergraduate health care students compared with other teaching methods. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus were searched (last search on May 2022) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental studies published in English between January 2000 and March 2022. The inclusion criteria were studies involving undergraduate students majoring in health care, IVR teaching, and evaluations of students’ learning outcomes and experiences. The methodological validity of the studies was examined using the Joanna Briggs Institute standard critical appraisal instruments for RCTs or quasi-experimental studies. The findings were synthesized without a meta-analysis using vote counting as the synthesis metric. A binomial test with P<.05 was used to test for statistical significance using SPSS (version 28; IBM Corp). The overall quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool. Results: A total of 17 articles from 16 studies totaling 1787 participants conducted between 2007 and 2021 were included. The undergraduate students in the studies majored in medicine, nursing, rehabilitation, pharmacy, biomedicine, radiography, audiology, or stomatology. The IVR teaching domains included procedural training (13/16, 81%), anatomical knowledge (2/16, 12%), and orientation to the operating room setting (1/16, 6%). The quality of the 75% (12/16) of RCT studies was poor, with unclear descriptions of randomization, allocation concealment, and outcome assessor blinding procedures. The overall risk of bias was relatively low in the 25% (4/16) of quasi-experimental studies. A vote count showed that 60% (9/15; 95% CI 16.3%-67.7%; P=.61) of the studies identified similar learning outcomes between IVR teaching and other teaching approaches regardless of teaching domains. The vote count showed that 62% (8/13) of the studies favored using IVR as a teaching medium. The results of the binomial test (95% CI 34.9%-90%; P=.59) did not show a statistically significant difference. Low-level evidence was identified based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool. Conclusions: This review found that undergraduate students had positive learning outcomes and experiences after engaging with IVR teaching, although the effects may be similar to those of other forms of virtual reality or conventional teaching methods. Given the identification of risk of bias and low level of the overall evidence, more studies with a larger sample size and robust study design are required to evaluate the effects of IVR teaching.",,"effects,immersive virtual reality,meta-synthesis,systematic review,undergraduate health care education,virtual reality",10.2196/39989,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/39989

A number of studies indicate the presence of a thyroid-gut axis and the important influence of the gut microbiota on thyroid function. As prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics show therapeutic potential in the treatment of intestinal dysbiosis, the aim of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of their supplementation in primary thyroid diseases. Review Methods. Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL), registers of clinical trials, and grey literature up to 6 October 2022 were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) meeting pre-specified inclusion criteria. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021235054). Brief description of the state of knowledge. After screening 1,721 references, two RCTs were identified, which included 136 hypothyroid participants in total. Meta-analysis of the results after eight weeks of supplementation with predominantly Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains indicated a clinically and statistically nonsignificant decrease in TSH (MD –0.19 mIU/L; 95% CI –0.43 to 0.06; I(2) = 0%), and no effect on fT(3) levels (MD 0.01 pg/mL; 95% CI–0.16 to 0.18; I(2) = 0%). Data from single studies indicated no significant change in the levels of fT(4), thyroid auto-antibodies, BMI, levothyroxine doses, and severity of symptoms measured with validated scales. Only constipation scores showed significant improvement (MD –8.71 points in the Faecal Incontinence Questionnaire; 95% CI –15.85 to –1.57; I(2) = 0%). Summary.

How can Cytokine-induced killer cells overcome CAR-T cell limits,,"Cappuzzello E., Vigolo E., D’Accardio G., Astori G., Rosato A., Sommaggio R.",9/8/23,9/11/23,Frontiers in Immunology (2023) 14 Article Number: 1229540. Date of Publication: 2023,Frontiers in Immunology,2023,14,,,,2023,Review,1664-3224 (electronic),"The successful treatment of patients affected by B-cell malignancies with Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cells represented a breakthrough in the field of adoptive cell therapy (ACT). However, CAR-T therapy is not an option for every patient, and several needs remain unmet. In particular, the production of CAR-T cells is expensive, labor-intensive and logistically challenging; additionally, the toxicities deriving from CAR-T cells infusion, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), have been documented extensively. Alternative cellular therapy products such as Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells have the potential to overcome some of these obstacles. CIK cells are a heterogeneous population of polyclonal CD3(+)CD56(+) T cells with phenotypic and functional properties of NK cells. CIK cell cytotoxicity is exerted in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted manner through the engagement of natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) molecules, against a wide range of hematological and solid tumors without the need for prior antigen exposure or priming. The foremost potential of CIK cells lies in the very limited ability to induce graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) reactions in the allogeneic setting. CIK cells are produced with a simple and extremely efficient expansion protocol, which leads to a massive expansion of effector cells and requires a lower financial commitment compared to CAR-T cells. Indeed, CAR-T manufacturing involves the engineering with expensive GMP-grade viral vectors in centralized manufacturing facilities, whereas CIK cell production is successfully performed in local academic GMP facilities, and CIK cell treatment is now licensed in many countries. Moreover, the toxicities observed for CAR-T cells are not present in CIK cell-treated patients, thus further reducing the costs associated with hospitalization and post-infusion monitoring of patients, and ultimately encouraging the delivery of cell therapies in the outpatient setting. This review aims to give an overview of the limitations of CAR-T cell therapy and outline how the use of CIK cells could overcome such drawbacks thanks to their unique features. We highlight the undeniable advantages of using CIK cells as a therapeutic product, underlying the opportunity for further research on the topic.",,"adoptive cell immunotherapy,ATMP,CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T cells,CIK (cytokine-induced killer) cells,GMP,GvHD,hematological malignancies,solid tumors",10.3389/fimmu.2023.1229540,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1229540

This systematic review aimed to study the clinical profile and outcome of patients with leptospirosis in India. Methodology: All articles up to 02.08.2022 were searched using the two databases, PubMed and Scopus. A total of 542 articles were found using the search terms related to ‘leptospirosis’ and ‘India’. After two rounds of screening, 55 articles were included. The data were collected on epidemiology, clinical features, laboratory features and treatment of patients with leptospirosis. Results: Most cases of leptospirosis were reported from the coastal belt. A large percentage of patients were identified as farmers, and exposure to rainfall was identified as an important risk factor. Fever was present in 97%, and conjunctival suffusion was present in 35% of cases. Haemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and haematuria were present in 5%, 5% and 12% of patients, respectively. Liver and kidney were involved in 34% and 35% of the patients, respectively.

The review shows the significance of preserving the specific functioning of the vaginal microecosystem, searching for new effective therapeutic opportunities in the treatment of infectious and inflammatory diseases and correction of dysbiotic disorders of the vaginal microbiota, its ability to resist pathogenic microorganisms. The unique local immune status directly correlates with the specific microbial composition of the vagina. Recent studies have shown the high efficiency of intestinal microbiota transplantation in gastroenterology. To date, there is a promising concept of introducing selective microbiota transplantation into clinical practice. According to this concept, it is possible to obtain autoprobiotics that can simultaneously solve the problem of safety during transplantation and provide personalized treatment. It is necessary to carry out further studies on the characteristics of pharmacological properties, on degree of stability and safety, on the ability of microorganisms to multiply in the vagina, and on the determination of dosage and frequency of use. The effectiveness of vaginal microbiota transplantation should be determined and proven in subsequent randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials. Conclusion: Autoprobiotics originating from the vagina can become the basis for the development of personalized medicines using a person’s own microbiota as it is safe and accessible and can help in the treatment of diseases with complex etiology and pathogenesis.

Date of Publication: 2023,Frontiers in Immunology,2023,14,,,,2023,Review,1664-3224 (electronic),"The COVID-19 outbreak has caused significant global changes and increased public awareness of SARS-CoV-2. Substantial progress in developing vaccines, enhancing sanitation practices, and implementing various measures to combat the virus, including the utilization of probiotics has been made. This comprehensive review examined the medical impact of clinically proven probiotics on infectious diseases, considering three crucial time periods: before (pre-), during (mid-), and after (post-) COVID-19 pandemic era. This review also showed a perspective on the use of probiotics to stimulate the innate immune system and prevent infectious diseases. In pre-COVID-19 era, several probiotic strains were found to be clinically effective in addressing gastrointestinal infectious diseases, the common cold and flu. However, the mechanism by which probiotics exerted their antiviral effects remained relatively unclear during that period. Nevertheless, probiotics, Lactococcus lactis strain Plasma (LC-Plasma), and others have gained attention for their unique ability to modulate the immune system and demonstrate antiviral properties. While some probiotics have shown promise in alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms linked to COVID-19, their direct effectiveness in treating or preventing COVID-19 progression has not yet been conclusively established. As we transition into the post-COVID-19 era, the relationship between COVID-19 and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), a vital component of the innate immune system, has been gradually elucidated. These findings are now being applied in developing novel vaccines and treatments involving interferons and in immune activation research using probiotics as adjuvants, comparable to CpG-DNA through TLR9. The role of the local innate immune system, including pDCs, as the first line of defense against viral infections has gained increasing interest. Moving forward, insight of the immune system and the crosstalk between probiotics and the innate immune system is expected to highlight the role of probiotics in adjunctive immunoregulatory therapy. In combination with drug treatments, probiotics may play a more substantial role in enhancing immune responses. The immunoregulatory approach using probiotics such as LC-Plasma, which can induce anti-infectious factors such as interferons, holds promise as a viable therapeutic and prophylactic option against viral infectious diseases due to their good safety profile and protective efficacy.",,"COVID-19,infectious disease,innate immunity,LC-plasma,probiotics",10.3389/fimmu.2023.1280680,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1280680

It is a first-in-class inhibitor of type 3 sodium/hydrogen exchanger (NHE3), characterized by very low oral absorption. Its pharmacological properties are discussed here based on the latest literature. Areas covered: A general description of tenapanor is provided, highlighting those pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the drug which may be of major importance for tolerability and safety. This description is associated with a summary and analysis of currently available toxicological data. Expert opinion: Plasma concentrations of free tenapanor after oral administration are well below the half maximal inhibitory concentration for NHE3, so that systemic effects of the drug are minimal. Therefore, the action of tenapanor is limited to NHE3 located on the apical membrane of enterocytes. The consequent reduction in intestinal sodium absorption increases the intraluminal content by osmosis, which in turn enhances the propulsive activity of the colon. Diarrhea is the most frequent adverse effect of tenapanor. Increased fecal sodium and water excretion do not appear to expose patients to short- and long-term hydro-electrolyte imbalances.",,"IBS,irritable bowel syndrome,NHE3,Tenapanor,type 3 sodium/hydrogen exchanger",10.1080/17425255.2023.2294937,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17425255.2023.2294937

Interventions for the eradication of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in people with cystic fibrosis,,"Lo D.K.H., Muhlebach M.S., Smyth A.R.",12/19/22,4/13/23,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022) 2022:12 Article Number: CD009650. Date of Publication: 13 Dec 2022,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2022,2022,12,,,13-Dec-22,Article,1465-1858,"Background: Cystic fibrosis is an inherited recessive disorder of chloride transport that is characterised by recurrent and persistent pulmonary infections from resistant organisms that result in lung function deterioration and early mortality in sufferers. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged not only as an important infection in people who are hospitalised, but also as a potentially harmful pathogen in cystic fibrosis. Chronic pulmonary infection with MRSA is thought to confer on people with cystic fibrosis a worse clinical outcome and result in an increased rate of lung function decline. Clear guidance for MRSA eradication in cystic fibrosis, supported by robust evidence, is urgently needed. This is an update of a previous review. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment regimens designed to eradicate MRSA and to determine whether the eradication of MRSA confers better clinical and microbiological outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. To ascertain whether attempts at eradicating MRSA can lead to increased acquisition of other resistant organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa), increased adverse effects from drugs, or both. Search methods: We identified randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials by searching the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders (CFGD) Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, PubMed, MEDLINE and three clinical trials registries; by handsearching article reference lists; and through contact with experts in the field. We last searched the CFGD Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register on 4 October 2021, and the ongoing trials registries on 31 January 2022. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of any combinations of topical, inhaled, oral or intravenous antimicrobials primarily aimed at eradicating MRSA compared with placebo, standard treatment or no treatment. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and used the GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results: The review includes three RCTs with 135 participants with MRSA infection. Two trials compared active treatment versus observation only and one trial compared active treatment with placebo. Active treatment versus observation. In both trials (106 participants), active treatment consisted of oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin. One trial administered this combination for two weeks alongside nasal, skin and oral decontamination and a three-week environmental decontamination, while the second trial administered this drug combination for 21 days with five days intranasal mupirocin. Both trials reported successful eradication of MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis, but they used different definitions of eradication. One trial (45 participants) defined MRSA eradication as negative MRSA respiratory cultures at day 28, and reported that oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin may lead to a higher proportion of negative cultures compared to control (odds ratio (OR) 12.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.84 to 55.84; low-certainty evidence). However, by day 168 of follow-up, there was no difference between groups in the proportion of participants who remained MRSA-negative (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.42; low-certainty evidence). The second trial defined successful eradication as the absence of MRSA following treatment in at least three cultures over a period of six months. We are uncertain if the intervention led to results favouring the treatment group as the certainty of the evidence was very low (OR 2.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 11.75). There were no differences between groups in the remaining outcomes for this comparison: quality of life, frequency of exacerbations or adverse effects (all low-certainty evidence) or the change from baseline in lung function or weight (both very low-certainty evidence). The time until next positive MRSA isolate was not reported. The included trials found no differences between groups in terms of nasal colonisation with MRSA. While not a specific outcome of this review, investigators from one study reported that the rate of hospitalisation from screening through day 168 was lower with oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin compared to control (rate ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.72; P = 0.01). Nebulised vancomycin with oral antibiotics versus nebulised placebo with oral antibiotics. The third trial (29 participants) defined eradication as a negative respiratory sample for MRSA at one month following completion of treatment. No differences were reported in MRSA eradication between treatment arms (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.39; low-certainty evidence). No differences between groups were seen in lung function or adverse effects (low-certainty evidence), in quality of life (very low-certainty evidence) or nasal colonisation with MRSA. The trial did not report on the change in weight or frequency of exacerbations. Authors' conclusions: Early eradication of MRSA is possible in people with cystic fibrosis, with one trial demonstrating superiority of active MRSA treatment compared with observation only in terms of the proportion of MRSA-negative respiratory cultures at day 28. However, follow-up at three or six months showed no difference between treatment and control in the proportion of participants remaining MRSA-negative. Moreover, the longer-term clinical consequences – in terms of lung function, mortality and cost of care – remain unclear. Using GRADE methodology, we judged the certainty of the evidence provided by this review to be very low to low, due to potential biases from the open-label design, high rates of attrition and small sample sizes. Based on the available evidence, we believe that whilst early eradication of respiratory MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis is possible, there is not currently enough evidence regarding the clinical outcomes of eradication to support the use of the interventions studied.",,,10.1002/14651858.CD009650.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009650.pub5
Influence of Vitamin A supplementation on inflammatory biomarkers in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials,,"Gholizadeh M., Basafa Roodi P., Abaj F., Shab-Bidar S., Saedisomeolia A., Asbaghi O., Lak M.",12/16/22,12/21/22,Scientific reports (2022) 12:1 (21384).

This study aimed to evaluate the association between vitamin A supplementation and c-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels in randomized control trials (RCTs) studies on adults. A systematic search was performed on databases including PUBMED, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane library. The studies included were considered for data extraction and subsequently assessed for effect. Weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated. Among 13,219 articles 13 studies were included for analysis of CRP and TNF-α, as well as 9 studies included for IL-6 in quality and quantity. The pooled WMD analysis of CRP demonstrated that vitamin A supplementation significantly increased CRP concentration with (WMD: 0.84 mg/L; 95% CI 0.29-1.39, I2 = 0.96.2% and p value < 0.003). However, there was no significant correlation between vitamin A supplementation and lower plasma TNF-α (p < 0.45)). Subgroup analysis by dosage demonstrate significant association between vitamin A supplementation and IL-6 in dosage with 50,000 with (WMD: - 1.53 mg/L; 95% CI - 2.36 to - 0.71, p value < 0.00001) as well as a negative significant association was seen at 44 weeks of supplementation with 50,000 IU/day retinyl palmitate and TNF-a in chronic hepatitis B conditions with (- 0.94 (- 1.19, - 0.69) p < 0.0001). The result of this study demonstrates that supplementation of vitamin A at low and high dosages for short and long durations increases the CRP plasma concentrations on adults and vitamin A supplementation decreases the TNF-α concentrations in chronic hepatitis B on adults. Therefore, there is an inverse association between vitamin A supplementation and plasma and fecal IL-6 concentrations in many infection conditions.",,,10.1038/s41598-022-23919-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-23919-x

In this review, we discuss the advantages and challenges of current BV treatments and interventions. Furthermore, we provide our understanding of why current clinical trials with probiotics have had mixed results, which is mainly due to not administering the correct bacteria to the correct body site.

Accumulating evidence shows that the development of IBD is always accompanied by the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota (GM), causing a decrease in prebiotic levels and an increase in harmful metabolite levels. This leads to persistent immune response and inflammation in the intestine, greatly impairing the physiological function of the gastrointestinal tract. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced by probiotic gut bacteria from a fiber-rich diet that cannot be digested directly. SCFAs with significant anti-inflammatory functions regulate immune function and prevent an excessive immune response, thereby delaying the clinical progression of IBD. In this review, we summarize the generation of SCFAs and their potential therapeutic effects on IBD. Furthermore, we suggest that SCFAs may modulate innate immune recognition and cytokine production to intervene in the progression of IBD. Additional randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies should also investigate the clinical impact of SCFA.

However, the safety of IMT in patients has not been established. Aims: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the safety of IMT. Methods: We systematically reviewed all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IMT studies published up to 28 February 2021 using databases including PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Studies were excluded if they did not report adverse events (AEs). Two authors independently extracted the data. The relative risk (RR) of serious adverse events (SAEs) and common adverse events (CAEs) were estimated separately, as were predefined subgroups. Publication bias was evaluated by a funnel plot and Egger’s regression test. Results: Among 978 reports, 99 full‐text articles were screened, and 20 articles were included for meta-analysis, involving 1132 patients (603 in the IMT group and 529 in the control group). We found no significant difference in the incidence of SAEs between the IMT group and the control group (RR = 1.36, 95% CI 0.56–3.31, P = 0.50). Of these 20 studies, 7 described the number of patients with CAEs, involving 360 patients (195 in the IMT group and 166 in the control group). An analysis of the eight studies revealed that the incidence of CAEs was also not significantly increased in the IMT group compared with the control group (RR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.91–1.23, P = 0.43). Subgroup analysis showed that the incidence of CAEs was significantly different between subgroups of delivery methods (P((CAE)) = 0.04), and the incidence of IMT-related SAEs and CAEs was not significantly different in the other predefined subgroups. Conclusion: Currently, IMT is widely used in many diseases, but its associated AEs should not be ignored. To improve the safety of IMT, patients' conditions should be fully evaluated before IMT, appropriate transplantation methods should be selected, each operative step of faecal bacteria transplantation should be strictly controlled, AE management mechanisms should be improved, and a close follow-up system should be established.",,"Adverse events,Intestinal microbiota transplantation,Meta-analysis,Randomized controlled trials",10.1186/s13099-022-00491-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13099-022-00491-3
Effects of screening strategies to detect carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria: A systematic review,,"Verdugo-Paiva F., Otaiza F., Roson-Rodríguez P., Rojas-Gomez A.M., Galas M., El Omeiri N., Fuentes Y., Rada G., Ramón-Pardo P.",4/21/22,3/1/23,American Journal of Infection Control (2022) 50:12 (1381-1388).

Methods: Eligible studies were randomized trials, non-randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series. We conducted searches in CENTRAL, PUBMED, Embase, Epistemonikos, and in multiple databases available in the Virtual Health Library (LILACS, Scielo, WHO IBECS, and PAHO IBECS). All the searches covered the period until 4 June 2021. No date or language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies according to predefined selection criteria, and extracted data on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and risk of bias, using a predesigned standardized form. When possible, we intended to conduct meta-analyses using a random-effect model. We assessed the certainty of the evidence (CoE) and summarized the results using the GRADE approach. Results: Our search strategy yielded 57,451 references. No randomized trials were identified. Sixteen studies (one controlled before-after study and 15 interrupted time series) met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Most studies were conducted in tertiary care general hospitals from the United States, Europe, and Asia. Eleven studies included adult patients hospitalized in general wards and intensive care units, one was carried out in a neonatal intensive care unit, two in hematology or oncology units, and one in a solid organ transplantation department. Eleven studies were conducted in the setting of an outbreak. Regarding the detection strategy used, all studies included screening strategies for high-risk patients at the moment of admission and 7 studies reported a contact surveillance strategy. Most studies were conducted in settings where infection prevention and control measures were concomitantly installed or reinforced. Data were not suitable for meta-analysis, so the results were presented as a narrative synthesis. Most studies showed a decline in the prevalence of both infection and colonization rates after the implementation of a policy of active surveillance, but the CoE is low. Screening strategies may result in little to no difference in the risk of all-cause mortality and the length of hospital stay. Conclusions: Existing evidence may favor the use of surveillance culture to carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria, but its quality is poor, so solid conclusions cannot be drawn. Well-conducted randomized trials or high-quality quasi-experimental studies are needed to improve the certainty of the existing evidence. These studies should assess the effect of the addition of screening strategies as a single intervention and measure clinically important outcomes such as infection, length of hospital stay, and mortality.",,"Acinetobacter,Carbapenem resistance,Enterobacteriaceae,Pseudomonas,Surveillance,Systematic review",10.1016/j.ajic.2022.02.018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2022.02.018

We are all aware that bacteria and other microorganisms have a significant impact on our health. Also, the health of the bacteria directly reflects the health status of the body where they reside. Eventually, alterations in the microbiome at different sites of a body are associated with many different diseases such as obe-sity, IBD, malnutrition, CVD, etc. Microbiota directly or indirectly affects the heart with the for-mation of plaques in the blood vessels, and cell walls become prone to lesion development. This ultimately leads to heightening the overall inflammatory status via increased bacterial translocation. Metabolites derived from the gut microbial metabolism of choline, phosphatidylcholine, and L-car-nitine directly contribute to CVD pathology. These dietary nutrients have trimethylamine (TMA) moiety, which participates in the development of atherosclerotic heart disease. The objective of this review was to examine various metabolic pathways regulated by the gut microbiome that appear to alter heart function and lead to the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases, as well as how to target the gut microbiome for a healthier heart.

Childhood obesity drives many comorbidities including hypertension, fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Prior research suggests that aberrant compositional development of the gut microbiome, with low-grade inflammation, precedes being overweight. Therefore, childhood may provide opportunities for interventions that shape the microbiome to mitigate obesity-related diseases. Children with obesity have gut microbiota compositional and functional differences, including increased proinflammatory bacterial taxa, compared to lean controls. Restoration of the gut microbiota to a healthy state may ameliorate conditions associated with obesity and help maintain a healthy weight. Pediatric bariatric (weight-loss) surgery is an effective treatment for childhood obesity; however, there is limited research into the role of the gut microbiome after weight-loss surgery in children.

Methods: The data were collected according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol guidelines. Inclusion criteria were articles that assessed administration of any cannabinoid to any clinical population, reported in the ClinicalTrials.gov or PubMed databases, that involved a comparison with other treatment or placebo and a result measurement to assess the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the cannabinoid. Exclusion criteria were review or letter; articles not in the English language; not full-text articles; not a clinical trial, case report, case series, open-label trial, or pilot study; administration in animals, in vitro, or in healthy participants; cannabinoids administered in combination with other cannabinoids (except for cannabidiol [CBD] or tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]) or as whole cannabis extracts; no stated concentration; inhalation or smoke as a route of administration; and no results described.

Date of Publication: 24 Nov 2022,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2022,2022,11,,,24-Nov-22,Article,1465-1858,"Background: Typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric fever) are febrile bacterial illnesses common in many low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends treatment with azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone due to widespread resistance to older, first-line antimicrobials. Resistance patterns vary in different locations and are changing over time. Fluoroquinolone resistance in South Asia often precludes the use of ciprofloxacin. Extensively drug-resistant strains of enteric fever have emerged in Pakistan. In some areas of the world, susceptibility to old first-line antimicrobials, such as chloramphenicol, has re-appeared. A Cochrane Review of the use of fluoroquinolones and azithromycin in the treatment of enteric fever has previously been undertaken, but the use of cephalosporins has not been systematically investigated and the optimal choice of drug and duration of treatment are uncertain. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of cephalosporins for treating enteric fever in children and adults compared to other antimicrobials. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 24 November 2021. We also searched reference lists of included trials, contacted researchers working in the field, and contacted relevant organizations. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults and children with enteric fever that compared a cephalosporin to another antimicrobial, a different cephalosporin, or a different treatment duration of the intervention cephalosporin. Enteric fever was diagnosed on the basis of blood culture, bone marrow culture, or molecular tests. Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were clinical failure, microbiological failure and relapse. Our secondary outcomes were time to defervescence, duration of hospital admission, convalescent faecal carriage, and adverse effects. We used the GRADE approach to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. Main results: We included 27 RCTs with 2231 total participants published between 1986 and 2016 across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the Caribbean, with comparisons between cephalosporins and other antimicrobials used for the treatment of enteric fever in children and adults. The main comparisons are between antimicrobials in most common clinical use, namely cephalosporins compared to a fluoroquinolone and cephalosporins compared to azithromycin. Cephalosporin (cefixime) versus fluoroquinolones. Clinical failure, microbiological failure and relapse may be increased in patients treated with cefixime compared to fluoroquinolones in three small trials published over 14 years ago: clinical failure (risk ratio (RR) 13.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.24 to 55.39; 2 trials, 240 participants; low-certainty evidence); microbiological failure (RR 4.07, 95% CI 0.46 to 36.41; 2 trials, 240 participants; low-certainty evidence); relapse (RR 4.45, 95% CI 1.11 to 17.84; 2 trials, 220 participants; low-certainty evidence). Time to defervescence in participants treated with cefixime may be longer compared to participants treated with fluoroquinolones (mean difference (MD) 1.74 days, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.98, 3 trials, 425 participants; low-certainty evidence). Cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) versus azithromycin. Ceftriaxone may result in a decrease in clinical failure compared to azithromycin, and it is unclear whether ceftriaxone has an effect on microbiological failure compared to azithromycin in two small trials published over 18 years ago and in one more recent trial, all conducted in participants under 18 years of age: clinical failure (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.57; 3 trials, 196 participants; low-certainty evidence); microbiological failure (RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.36 to 10.64, 3 trials, 196 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether ceftriaxone increases or decreases relapse compared to azithromycin (RR 10.05, 95% CI 1.93 to 52.38; 3 trials, 185 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Time to defervescence in participants treated with ceftriaxone may be shorter compared to participants treated with azithromycin (mean difference of −0.52 days, 95% CI −0.91 to −0.12; 3 trials, 196 participants; low-certainty evidence). Cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) versus fluoroquinolones. It is unclear whether ceftriaxone has an effect on clinical failure, microbiological failure, relapse, and time to defervescence compared to fluoroquinolones in three trials published over 28 years ago and two more recent trials: clinical failure (RR 3.77, 95% CI 0.72 to 19.81; 4 trials, 359 participants; very low-certainty evidence); microbiological failure (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.40 to 6.83; 3 trials, 316 participants; very low-certainty evidence); relapse (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.92; 3 trials, 297 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and time to defervescence (MD 2.73 days, 95% CI −0.37 to 5.84; 3 trials, 285 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether ceftriaxone decreases convalescent faecal carriage compared to the fluoroquinolone gatifloxacin (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.72; 1 trial, 73 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and length of hospital stay may be longer in participants treated with ceftriaxone compared to participants treated with the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin (mean of 12 days (range 7 to 23 days) in the ceftriaxone group compared to a mean of 9 days (range 6 to 13 days) in the ofloxacin group; 1 trial, 47 participants; low-certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: Based on very low- to low-certainty evidence, ceftriaxone is an effective treatment for adults and children with enteric fever, with few adverse effects. Trials suggest that there may be no difference in the performance of ceftriaxone compared with azithromycin, fluoroquinolones, or chloramphenicol. Cefixime can also be used for treatment of enteric fever but may not perform as well as fluoroquinolones. We are unable to draw firm general conclusions on comparative contemporary effectiveness given that most trials were small and conducted over 20 years previously. Clinicians need to take into account current, local resistance patterns in addition to route of administration when choosing an antimicrobial.",,,10.1002/14651858.CD010452.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010452.pub2

Background: FMT has shown good outcomes in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of FMT versus MT for CDI. Study: We performed a comprehensive search to identify randomized controlled trials comparing FMT against MT in patients with CDI. Outcomes of interest were clinical cure as determined by the resolution of diarrhea and/or negative C. difficile testing. Primary CDI is defined as the first episode of CDI confirmed endoscopically or by laboratory analysis. Recurrent C. difficile infection (RCDI) is defined as laboratory or endoscopically confirmed episode of CDI after at least 1 course of approved antibiotic regimen. Results: A total of 7 studies with 238 patients were included in meta-analysis. Compared with MT, FMT did not have a statistically significant difference for clinical cure of combined primary and RCDI after first session [risk ratio (RR): 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.90, 2.58; P=0.12; I (2)=77%] and multiple sessions of FMT (RR: 1.68; CI: 0.96, 2.94; P=0.07; I (2)=82%). On subgroup analysis, FMT has statistically higher rate of response than MT (RR: 2.41; CI: 1.20, 4.83; I (2)=78%) for RCDI. However, for primary CDI there is no statistically significant difference between FMT and MT (RR: 1.00; CI: 0.72, 1.39; I (2)=0%). Conclusion: As per our analysis, FMT should not be utilized for every patient with CDI. It is more effective in RCDI, but the results were not significant in patients with primary CDI.",,"CDI,Clostridium difficile,fecal microbiota transplantation,fecal transplant,FMT",10.1097/MCG.0000000000001610,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MCG.0000000000001610

Clarifying the relationship between microbiota and inflammation may profoundly improve our understanding of etiology, disease progression, patient management, and the development of prevention and treatment. In this review, we discuss the latest studies of the influence of enteric viruses (i.e., commensal viruses, pathogenic viruses, and bacteriophages) in the initiation, progression, and complication of colitis and colorectal cancer, and their potential for novel preventative approaches and therapeutic application. We explore the interplay between gut viruses and host immune systems for its effects on the severity of inflammatory diseases and cancer, including both direct and indirect interactions between enteric viruses with other microbes and microbial products. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of the virome's roles in gut inflammatory response have been explained to infer potential therapeutic targets with examples in specific clinical trials. Given that very limited literature has thus far discussed these various topics with the gut virome, we believe these extensive analyses may provide insight into the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of IBD and CRC, which could help add the design of improved therapies for these important human diseases.",,"Bacteriophage,Colorectal cancer,Inflammatory bowel disease,Oncolytic virus,Virome",10.1016/j.semcancer.2021.10.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.semcancer.2021.10.004

IBD is often diagnosed in early adulthood and can lead to a substantial decline in quality of life. It has been suggested that patients with IBD are at increased risk of depression and anxiety, but it is still unclear to what extent these diseases co-occur and in what sequence they arise. This Review summarizes the literature on the degree of co-occurrence of IBD with depression and anxiety and the temporal relationship between these diseases. We also discuss the effect of psychological stress on the onset and course of IBD. In addition, we outline the possible mechanisms underlying the co-occurrence of IBD and depression and anxiety, which include changes in brain signalling and morphology, increases in peripheral and intracerebral pro-inflammatory cytokines, impairment of the nitric oxide pathway, changes in vagal nerve signalling, gut dysbiosis and genetics. Finally, we examine the possible effects of treatment of depression and anxiety on the risk and course of IBD, the influence of psychological interventions on IBD, and the effects of IBD treatment on psychiatric comorbidity.",,,10.1038/s41575-022-00634-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41575-022-00634-6

We aimed to assess the research trends and hotspots in the field of FMT through a quantitative method. Materials and Methods: The clinical studies of FMT published from 2001 to 2021 were extracted from the Web of Science database. We analyzed the countries, institutions, authors, and keywords of these articles and visually illustrated using VOSviewer and CiteSpace software. The current application of FMT in clinical practice, including indications, efficacy, adverse events, as well as its methodology, such as donor, delivery route, were also evaluated. Results: A total of 227 records were finally identified. The number and rate of annual publications increased gradually. The USA ranked highest in the number of publications. Harvard University was the most influential institution, and Digestive Diseases and Sciences was the most productive journal. Kassam Zain published the most papers, and the high-frequency keywords were mainly related to diseases and techniques. Healthy donors were the most widely used donors, and frozen stool had the highest frequency of use. The predominant delivery route was endoscopy followed by oral capsules and enema. FMT was most frequently performed for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium Difficile Infection. The overall efficacy of FMT was 76.88%, and the incidence of minor and severe adverse events were 11.63% and 1.59%, respectively. Conclusions: This study delineated a comprehensive landscape of the advancement in FMT field.

Describe the frequency of viral RNA detection in stools in a cohort of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 2. Perform a systematic review to assess the clearance time in stools of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study in two centers between March and May 2020. We included SARS-CoV-2 infected patients of any age and severity. We collected seriated nasopharyngeal swabs and stool samples to detect SARS-CoV-2. After, we performed a systematic review of the prevalence and clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in stools (PROSPERO-ID: CRD42020192490). We estimated prevalence using a random-effects model. We assessed clearance time by using Kaplan–Meier curves. Results: We included 32 patients; mean age was 43.7 ± 17.7 years, 43.8% were female, and 40.6% reported gastrointestinal symptoms. Twenty-five percent (8/32) of patients had detectable viral RNA in stools. The median clearance time in stools of the cohort was 11[10–15] days. Systematic review included 30 studies (1392 patients) with stool samples. Six studies were performed in children and 55% were male. The pooled prevalence of viral detection in stools was 34.6% (twenty-four studies, 1393 patients; 95%CI:25.4–45.1); heterogeneity was high (I(2):91.2%, Q:208.6; p ≤ 0.001). A meta-regression demonstrates an association between female-gender and lower presence in stools (p = 0.004). The median clearance time in stools was 22 days (nineteen studies, 140 patients; 95%CI:19–25). After 34 days, 19.9% (95%CI:11.3–29.7) of patients have a persistent detection in stools.

However, the stability of artificially added active hydrogen was far less than that of pure natural active hydrogen, which greatly reduced active hydrogen molecules number in HRW. Meanwhile, the effect of HRW was relatively slow. Finally, long-term drinking of HRW may cause abnormal liver function. Hence, this study sought to summarize and analyze the effects of HRW on oral inflammation and oral flora in various studies to determine whether HRW can be used to inhibit dental plaque formation and aliviate oral inflammation. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of HRW and pure water (PW) in the treatment of periodontal diseases published before March 2022 in the PubMed, Web of science, EMBASE, Cochrane, China Knowledge Resource Integrated, Wanfang, and Weipu databases were searched. Changes in the inflammatory factor levels, oxidative stress response, and oral flora were summarized and used as outcome indicators. The quality of included studies was assessed by Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool, and the standardized mean differences (SMD) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Review Manager 5.3. Results: In total, 17 studies, comprising 304 subjects, were included in this meta-analysis.

Objectives: Here, we hypothesize that the Mediterranean diet, possibly via the induction of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), improves intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, we aim to establish novel personalized nutrition advice based on machine learning algorithms. Methods: We studied 260 women with intestinal barrier impairment. The women were allocated to follow either a Mediterranean diet or a control diet for 3 mo. Intestinal permeability was assessed by measuring lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) in plasma and zonulin in feces. SCFA concentrations were analyzed in feces. Bi- and multivariate analyses and machine learning algorithms (random forest classification) were conducted. Results: Particularly in the intervention group, adherence to the Mediterranean diet increased, whereas plasma LBP and fecal zonulin concentrations decreased (all q < 0.001 for the intervention group, all q < 0.1 for control group). In the intervention group, fecal SCFA concentrations increased (propionate + 19%; butyrate + 44%; both q < 0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with SCFA concentrations (all q < 0.001) and inversely associated with LBP and zonulin concentrations (all q < 0.02). Mediation analyses identified propionate and butyrate as the key mechanistic link between diet and intestinal permeability integrity. Accordingly, using baseline SCFA data, we could predict the effect of the Mediterranean diet on intestinal permeability using a machine learning algorithm (receiver operating characteristic AUC: 0.78-0.96). Conclusions: Our data suggest that SCFAs are key mediators for the relation between diet and gut health. Assessment of SCFAs may form a basis for personalized nutrition in future clinical care.

Date of Publication: 20 Sep 2022,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2022,2022,9,,,20-Sep-22,Article,1465-1858,"Background: Solid organ transplantation has seen improvements in both surgical techniques and immunosuppression, achieving prolonged survival. Essential to graft acceptance and post-transplant recovery, immunosuppressive medications are often accompanied by a high prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and side effects. Apart from GI side effects, long-term exposure to immunosuppressive medications has seen an increase in drug-related morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, and malignancy. Non-adherence to immunosuppression can lead to an increased risk of graft failure. Recent research has indicated that any microbial imbalances (otherwise known as gut dysbiosis or leaky gut) may be associated with cardiometabolic diseases in the long term. Current evidence suggests a link between the gut microbiome and the production of putative uraemic toxins, increased gut permeability, and transmural movement of bacteria and endotoxins and inflammation. Early observational and intervention studies have been investigating food-intake patterns, various synbiotic interventions (antibiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics), and faecal transplants to measure their effects on microbiota in treating cardiometabolic diseases. It is believed high doses of synbiotics, prebiotics and probiotics are able to modify and improve dysbiosis of gut micro-organisms by altering the population of the micro-organisms. With the right balance in the gut flora, a primary benefit is believed to be the suppression of pathogens through immunostimulation and gut barrier enhancement (less permeability of the gut). Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of synbiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics for recipients of solid organ transplantation. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 9 March 2022 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials measuring and reporting the effects of synbiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics, in any combination and any formulation given to solid organ transplant recipients (any age and setting). Two authors independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts and, where necessary, the full text to determine which satisfied the inclusion criteria. Data collection and analysis: Data extraction was independently carried out by two authors using a standard data extraction form. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross-checked by another. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Main results: Five studies (250 participants) were included in this review. Study participants were adults with a kidney (one study) or liver (four studies) transplant. One study compared a synbiotic to placebo, two studies compared a probiotic to placebo, and two studies compared a synbiotic to a prebiotic. Overall, the quality of the evidence is poor. Most studies were judged to have unclear (or high) risk of bias across most domains. Of the available evidence, meta-analyses undertaken were of limited data from small studies. Across all comparisons, GRADE evaluations for all outcomes were judged to be very low certainty evidence. Very low certainty evidence implies that we are very uncertain about results (not estimable due to lack of data or poor quality). Synbiotics had uncertain effects on the change in microbiota composition (total plasma p-cresol), faecal characteristics, adverse events, kidney function or albumin concentration (1 study, 34 participants) compared to placebo. Probiotics had uncertain effects on GI side effects, infection rates immediately post-transplant, liver function, blood pressure, change in fatty liver, and lipids (1 study, 30 participants) compared to placebo. Synbiotics had uncertain effects on graft health (acute liver rejection) (2 studies, 129 participants: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.25; 2 studies, 129 participants; I² = 0%), the use of immunosuppression, infection (2 studies, 129 participants: RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.17; I² = 66%), GI function (time to first bowel movement), adverse events (2 studies, 129 participants: RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.59; I² = 20%), serious adverse events (2 studies, 129 participants: RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.42 to 5.36; I² = 81%), death (2 studies, 129 participants), and organ function measures (2 studies; 129 participants) compared to prebiotics. Authors' conclusions: This review highlights the severe lack of high-quality RCTs testing the efficacy of synbiotics, prebiotics or probiotics in solid organ transplant recipients. We have identified significant gaps in the evidence. Despite GI symptoms and postoperative infection being the most common reasons for high antibiotic use in this patient population, along with increased morbidity and the growing antimicrobial resistance, we found very few studies that adequately tested these as alternative treatments. There is currently no evidence to support or refute the use of synbiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics in solid organ transplant recipients, and findings should be viewed with caution. We have identified an area of significant uncertainty about the efficacy of synbiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics in solid organ transplant recipients. Future research in this field requires adequately powered RCTs comparing synbiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics separately and with placebo measuring a standard set of core transplant outcomes. Six studies are currently ongoing (822 proposed participants); therefore, it is possible that findings may change with their inclusion in future updates.",,,10.1002/14651858.CD014804.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD014804.pub2
Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay for tuberculosis disease and rifampicin resistance in children,,"Kay A.W., Ness T., Verkuijl S.E., Viney K., Brands A., Masini T., González Fernández L., Eisenhut M., Detjen A.K., Mandalakas A.M., Steingart K.R., Takwoingi Y.",9/15/22,10/6/22,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022) 2022:9 Article Number: CD013359. Date of Publication: 6 Sep 2022,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2022,2022,9,,,6-Sep-22,Article,1465-1858,"Background: Every year, an estimated one million children and young adolescents become ill with tuberculosis, and around 226,000 of those children die. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) is a molecular World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended rapid diagnostic test that simultaneously detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance. We previously published a Cochrane Review 'Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assays for tuberculosis disease and rifampicin resistance in children'. The current review updates evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert Ultra in children presumed to have tuberculosis disease. Parts of this review update informed the 2022 WHO updated guidance on management of tuberculosis in children and adolescents. Objectives: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert Ultra for detecting: pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance, in children with presumed tuberculosis. Secondary objectives. To investigate potential sources of heterogeneity in accuracy estimates. For detection of tuberculosis, we considered age, comorbidity (HIV, severe pneumonia, and severe malnutrition), and specimen type as potential sources. To summarize the frequency of Xpert Ultra trace results. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and three trial registers without language restrictions to 9 March 2021. Selection criteria: Cross-sectional and cohort studies and randomized trials that evaluated Xpert Ultra in HIV-positive and HIV-negative children under 15 years of age. We included ongoing studies that helped us address the review objectives. We included studies evaluating sputum, gastric, stool, or nasopharyngeal specimens (pulmonary tuberculosis), cerebrospinal fluid (tuberculous meningitis), and fine needle aspirate or surgical biopsy tissue (lymph node tuberculosis). For detecting tuberculosis, reference standards were microbiological (culture) or composite reference standard; for stool, we also included Xpert Ultra performed on a routine respiratory specimen. For detecting rifampicin resistance, reference standards were drug susceptibility testing or MTBDRplus. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and, using QUADAS-2, assessed methodological quality judging risk of bias separately for each target condition and reference standard. For each target condition, we used the bivariate model to estimate summary sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We stratified all analyses by type of reference standard. We summarized the frequency of Xpert Ultra trace results; trace represents detection of a very low quantity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA. We assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE. Main results: We identified 14 studies (11 new studies since the previous review). For detection of pulmonary tuberculosis, 335 data sets (25,937 participants) were available for analysis. We did not identify any studies that evaluated Xpert Ultra accuracy for tuberculous meningitis or lymph node tuberculosis. Three studies evaluated Xpert Ultra for detection of rifampicin resistance. Ten studies (71%) took place in countries with a high tuberculosis burden based on WHO classification. Overall, risk of bias was low. Detection of pulmonary tuberculosis. Sputum, 5 studies. Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity verified by culture was 75.3% (95% CI 64.3 to 83.8; 127 participants; high-certainty evidence), and specificity was 97.1% (95% CI 94.7 to 98.5; 1054 participants; high-certainty evidence). Gastric aspirate, 7 studies. Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity verified by culture was 70.4% (95% CI 53.9 to 82.9; 120 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and specificity was 94.1% (95% CI 84.8 to 97.8; 870 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Stool, 6 studies. Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity verified by culture was 56.1% (95% CI 39.1 to 71.7; 200 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and specificity was 98.0% (95% CI 93.3 to 99.4; 1232 participants; high certainty-evidence). Nasopharyngeal aspirate, 4 studies. Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity verified by culture was 43.7% (95% CI 26.7 to 62.2; 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and specificity was 97.5% (95% CI 93.6 to 99.0; 489 participants; high-certainty evidence). Xpert Ultra sensitivity was lower against a composite than a culture reference standard for all specimen types other than nasopharyngeal aspirate, while specificity was similar against both reference standards. Interpretation of results. In theory, for a population of 1000 children:. • where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in sputum (by culture):. - 101 would be Xpert Ultra-positive, and of these, 26 (26%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (false positive); and- 899 would be Xpert Ultra-negative, and of these, 25 (3%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). • where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in gastric aspirate (by culture):. - 123 would be Xpert Ultra-positive, and of these, 53 (43%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (false positive); and- 877 would be Xpert Ultra-negative, and of these, 30 (3%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). • where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in stool (by culture):. - 74 would be Xpert Ultra-positive, and of these, 18 (24%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (false positive); and- 926 would be Xpert Ultra-negative, and of these, 44 (5%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). • where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in nasopharyngeal aspirate (by culture):. - 66 would be Xpert Ultra-positive, and of these, 22 (33%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (false positive); and- 934 would be Xpert Ultra-negative, and of these, 56 (6%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). Detection of rifampicin resistance. Xpert Ultra sensitivity was 100% (3 studies, 3 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and specificity range was 97% to 100% (3 studies, 128 participants; low-certainty evidence). Trace results. Xpert Ultra trace results, regarded as positive in children by WHO standards, were common. Xpert Ultra specificity remained high in children, despite the frequency of trace results. Authors' conclusions: We found Xpert Ultra sensitivity to vary by specimen type, with sputum having the highest sensitivity, followed by gastric aspirate and stool. Nasopharyngeal aspirate had the lowest sensitivity. Xpert Ultra specificity was high against both microbiological and composite reference standards. However, the evidence base is still limited, and findings may be imprecise and vary by study setting. Although we found Xpert Ultra accurate for detection of rifampicin resistance, results were based on a very small number of studies that included only three children with rifampicin resistance. Therefore, findings should be interpreted with caution. Our findings provide support for the use of Xpert Ultra as an initial rapid molecular diagnostic in children being evaluated for tuberculosis.",,,10.1002/14651858.CD013359.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013359.pub3
Targeting the Gut Microbiome to Treat Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease: Ready for Prime Time?,,"Lanthier N., Delzenne N.",9/20/22,9/26/22,Cells (2022) 11:17 Article Number: 2718.

Animal studies have also shown a causal role of gut microbiota in liver metabolic disorders including steatosis whereas the human situation is less clear. Patients with metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) also have a modification in their gut microbiota composition but the changes are not fully characterized. The absence of consensus on a precise signature is probably due to disease heterogeneity, possible concomitant medications and different selection or evaluation criteria. The most consistent changes were increased relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia species and decreased abundance of Coprococcus and Eubacterium. Possible mechanisms linking the microbiota and MAFLD are increased intestinal permeability with translocation of microbial products into the portal circulation, but also changes in the bile acids and production of microbial metabolites such as ethanol, short chain fatty acids and amino acid derivatives able to modulate liver metabolism and inflammation. Several interventional studies exist that attempt to modulate liver disease by administering antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics or fecal transplantation. In conclusion, there are both gaps and hopes concerning the interest of gut microbiome evaluation for diagnosis purposes of MAFLD and for new therapeutic developments that are often tested on small size cohorts.",,"gut,MAFLD,microbiome,microbiota,NASH,postbiotic,prebiotic,probiotic,steatosis",10.3390/cells11172718,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cells11172718

Several randomized trials have tested FMT effects using different routes of administration, doses, and sample sizes. We aim to assess the overall efficacy of FMT for IBS patients and the safety of the intervention. Methods: We systematically searched four databases for randomized control trials that studied the efficacy and safety of FMT in IBS patients. Results: We included 8 randomized trials (472 patients) that compared FMT with placebo in IBS patients. Pooled results showed no statistically significant difference between FMT and control groups in the overall change in IBS symptom severity (IBS-SSS) at 1 month (p = 0.94), 3/4 months (p = 0.82), and at the end of trials (p = 0.67). No significant difference in the total number of respondents between the FMT and control groups (risk ratios = 1.84, [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.82–2.65], p = 0.19). Although the oral route of administration showed a significant difference in the number of respondents (p = 0.004), there was no statistically significant difference in the IBS-SSS when subgrouping the oral route of administration (mean difference = 47.57, [95% CI = −8.74–103.87], p = 0.10). Conclusion: FMT is not an effective treatment to relieve all the symptoms of IBS. Even in the groups that showed relatively significant improvement after FMT, the effect was proven to wear off over time and the re-administration carries a low success rate.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2022,Oncology Research and Treatment,2022,45,,252,,1-Sep-22,Conference Abstract,2296-5262,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is still associated with a high risk of mortality due to infectious complications and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). The need for a better understanding of intestinal aGvHD pathophysiology has led to growing evidence showing a crucial role of intestinal microbiota. During allogeneic SCT, in particular in cases of aGvHD development a loss of intestinal microbiome diversity can be observed mainly consisting of a reduction of protective bacteria such as Clostridiales and an overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria e.g., Enterococci. Low microbial diversity however is associated with significantly higher transplant-related mortality (TRM), mainly due to aGvHD and poor overall survival. An early and prolonged antibiotic exposure, conditioning regimen toxicity as well as an impaired oral intake have been identified as major risk factors for disrupting the microbiome. Minimal oral intake for a prolonged period is associated with less diversity and less abundance of intestinal Blautia. Malnutrition per se represents an independent negative prognostic factor for survival of SCT recipients. Therefore, parenteral nutrition (PN) is usually recommended during the peri-transplant period. However, few single-center studies with small numbers of patients reported a superiority of enteral nutrition over PN in terms of transplant-related complications and survival as well as increased microbial diversity. Further, in murine models a lactose-free diet was able to reduce enterococcal overgrowth and to mitigate aGvHD severity. Whether a specific diet could help to preserve a healthy microbiome in allogeneic SCT recipients remains to be elucidated in randomized trials. Additionally, high inter-personal variability in microbiome response to types of nutrition might prove it difficult to formulate universal dietary recommendations. Further, it is worth considering microbiota-targeting therapies, that pre-emptively optimize microbiota prior to SCT or restore intestinal diversity post SCT. At present, potential strategies for microbiota modification include prebiotics, probiotics or postbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation. However, large-scaled prospective and randomized studies are needed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of these products in immunosuppressed patients and to investigate their potency with respect to preservation of microbiome diversity and reduction of transplant-related complications.",,,10.1159/000526456,http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000526456

Design: Systematic review and network meta-analysis. Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov, SinoMed, Chinese Biomedicine, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, and Chongqing VIP Information databases were comprehensively searched from the beginning to February 2022. Review Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including Bailing capsule (BLC); Jinshuibao capsule (JSB); Huangkui capsule (HKC); Compound Xueshuantong capsule (CXC); uremic clearance granule (UCG); Shenyan Kangfu tablet (SYKFT); tripterygium glycosides (TG); Keluoxin capsule (KLX), and Shenshuaining tablet (SSNT) combined with ACEI/ARB for patients with early DKD were reviewed. Data Synthesis: Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Risk ratios (RRs) and mean difference (MD) were reckoned to assess dichotomous variable quantities and continuous variable quantities, respectively. Using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), we then ranked each therapeutic regime. Results: Ultimately, 160 RCTs involving 13,365 patients and nine CPMs were included. UCG showed significantly higher probabilities on urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) when compared with ACEI/ARB group, with MD of −47 (95%CI) (−57, −37) and SUCRA 98.0%. The CXC group achieved a remarkable improvement in overall response rate (ORR) compared with ACEI/ARB (RR, 1.3, 95%CI (1.2, 1.5)) with SUCRA 91.9%. SSNT could be significantly superior to ACEI/ARB group in terms of serum creatinine (Scr) (−19 (−26, −12), SUCRA 99.3%) and adverse effects (AEs) (0.46 (0.17, 1.1), SUCRA 82.9%). BLC showed the greatest effectiveness on 24 h urinary total protein (24 h UTP) (−170 (−260, −83), SUCRA 78.5%) and triglyceride (Trig) (−0.89 (−1.2, −0.53), SUCRA 97.0%). From the cost-effectiveness analysis of CPMs in China, the cost of TG, SYKFT and CXC was 108, 600, and 648 RMB, respectively, per 3 months and were ranked in the top three. Conclusion: UCG and CXC might be the optimum selection for improving UAER and ORR, and SSNT could be significantly superior to ACEI/ARB group in terms of Scr and AEs.

Preprocedural mouth rinses for preventing transmission of infectious diseases through aerosols in dental healthcare providers,,"Kumbargere Nagraj S., Eachempati P., Paisi M., Nasser M., Sivaramakrishnan G., Francis T., Verbeek J.H.",8/31/22,9/9/22,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022) 2022:8 Article Number: CD013826. Date of Publication: 22 Aug 2022,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2022,2022,8,,,22-Aug-22,Article,1465-1858,"Background: Aerosols and spatter are generated in a dental clinic during aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) that use high-speed hand pieces. Dental healthcare providers can be at increased risk of transmission of diseases such as tuberculosis, measles and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) through droplets on mucosae, inhalation of aerosols or through fomites on mucosae, which harbour micro-organisms. There are ways to mitigate and contain spatter and aerosols that may, in turn, reduce any risk of disease transmission. In addition to personal protective equipment (PPE) and aerosol-reducing devices such as high-volume suction, it has been hypothesised that the use of mouth rinse by patients before dental procedures could reduce the microbial load of aerosols that are generated during dental AGPs. Objectives: To assess the effects of preprocedural mouth rinses used in dental clinics to minimise incidence of infection in dental healthcare providers and reduce or neutralise contamination in aerosols. Search methods: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 4 February 2022. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials and excluded laboratory-based studies. Study participants were dental patients undergoing AGPs. Studies compared any preprocedural mouth rinse used to reduce contaminated aerosols versus placebo, no mouth rinse or another mouth rinse. Our primary outcome was incidence of infection of dental healthcare providers and secondary outcomes were reduction in the level of contamination of the dental operatory environment, cost, change in mouth microbiota, adverse events, and acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors screened search results, extracted data from included studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and judged the certainty of the available evidence. We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the effect estimate for continuous outcomes, and random-effects meta-analysis to combine data. Main results: We included 17 studies with 830 participants aged 18 to 70 years. We judged three trials at high risk of bias, two at low risk and 12 at unclear risk of bias. None of the studies measured our primary outcome of the incidence of infection in dental healthcare providers. The primary outcome in the studies was reduction in the level of bacterial contamination measured in colony-forming units (CFUs) at distances of less than 2 m (intended to capture larger droplets) and 2 m or more (to capture droplet nuclei from aerosols arising from the participant's oral cavity). It is unclear what size of CFU reduction represents a clinically significant amount. There is low- to very low-certainty evidence that chlorhexidine (CHX) may reduce bacterial contamination, as measured by CFUs, compared with no rinsing or rinsing with water. There were similar results when comparing cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) with no rinsing and when comparing CPC, essential oils/herbal mouthwashes or boric acid with water. There is very low-certainty evidence that tempered mouth rinses may provide a greater reduction in CFUs than cold mouth rinses. There is low-certainty evidence that CHX may reduce CFUs more than essential oils/herbal mouthwashes. The evidence for other head-to-head comparisons was limited and inconsistent. The studies did not provide any information on costs, change in micro-organisms in the patient's mouth or adverse events such as temporary discolouration, altered taste, allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. The studies did not assess acceptability of the intervention to patients or feasibility of implementation for dentists. Authors' conclusions: None of the included studies measured the incidence of infection among dental healthcare providers. The studies measured only reduction in level of bacterial contamination in aerosols. None of the studies evaluated viral or fungal contamination. We have only low to very low certainty for all findings. We are unable to draw conclusions regarding whether there is a role for preprocedural mouth rinses in reducing infection risk or the possible superiority of one preprocedural rinse over another. Studies are needed that measure the effect of rinses on infectious disease risk among dental healthcare providers and on contaminated aerosols at larger distances with standardised outcome measurement.",,,10.1002/14651858.CD013826.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013826.pub2

Intermittent enteral nutrition (IEN) may be a suitable alternative method. This meta-analysis aims to investigate the safety, tolerance, and effectiveness of IEN compared with that of CEN in critically ill adults in the ICU. Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for studies published up until April 30, 2020, along with manual searches in bibliographies. Eligible studies were trials that compared CEN with IEN feeding in the ICU and reported on at least one of the relevant outcomes (nutrition intake, gastric residual volume [GRV], aspiration pneumonia, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distension, and glycemic variability). Secondary outcomes were ICU length of stay (LOS) and mortality. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials was used to assess methodological quality. Results: Ten studies with 664 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Most studies had an overall “high” risk of bias. Incidence of vomiting was significantly higher in CEN than in IEN groups (risk ratio, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.23–6.23). There were no significant differences between CEN and IEN groups for nutrition intake, GRV, incidence of aspiration pneumonia, diarrhea, abdominal distension, ICU LOS, and mortality. Definition and reporting of outcome measures were not standardized across studies; hence, this heterogeneity limits the generalizability of results. Conclusion: Overall, the safety, tolerance, and effectiveness of CEN and IEN were found to be comparable.

We used the data from the CEREMI trial in which 22 healthy volunteers received a 3-day course of ceftriaxone or cefotaxime antibiotics. Fecal samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene profiling, and the total bacterial counts were determined in each sample by flux cytometry. As the gut exposure to antibiotics could not be experimentally measured despite a marked impact on the gut microbiota, it was reconstructed using the counts of susceptible Escherichia coli. The dynamics of absolute counts of bacterial families were analyzed using a generalized Lotka–Volterra equations and nonlinear mixed effect modeling. Bacterial interactions were studied using a stepwise approach. Two negative and three positive interactions were identified. Introducing bacterial interactions in the modeling approach better fitted the data, and provided different estimates of antibiotic effects on each bacterial family than a simple model without interaction. The time to return to 95% of the baseline counts was significantly longer in ceftriaxone-treated individuals than in cefotaxime-treated subjects for two bacterial families: Akkermansiaceae (median [range]: 11.3 days [0; 180.0] vs. 4.2 days [0; 25.6], p = 0.027) and Tannerellaceae (13.7 days [6.1; 180.0] vs. 6.2 days [5.4; 17.3], p = 0.003).

Supplementation with probiotics may have beneficial effects on gut inflammation due to their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. The primary objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of a mix of three probiotic strains (Bifidobacterium lactis LA 304, Lactobacillus salivarius LA 302, and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 201; Lactibiane Iki®) in the reduction in fecal calprotectin in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, compared to a control group. The secondary aim was to evaluate the reduction in oxygen support and length of hospital stay in patients taking the probiotic mix. Patients and Methods: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial at Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli, Rome. We enrolled patients with COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia. One group received the probiotic mix twice a day for 10 days in addition to the standard COVID-19 therapy, and a second group received standard COVID-19 therapy without probiotics. We administered oxygen support (through Ventimask or Optiflow®) on days (D) 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10, and the level of fecal calprotectin between D3–D5 and D7–D10. Results: A total of 80 patients (44 M/36 F; mean age: 59.8 ± 17.3) were enrolled with a mean value of calprotectin at enrollment of 140 mg/dl. At D7–10, the probiotic group showed a 35% decrease in fecal calprotectin compared to 16% in the control group, a decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) of 72.7% compared to 62%, and a slight but not significant decrease in oxygen support compared to the control group.

This process involves adhesion molecules, chemoattractants and receptors expressed on immune cell surfaces, blood vessels and stromal intestinal tissue as well as signalling pathways, including those modulated by sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). The complex biological processes of leukocyte recruitment, activation, adhesion and migration have been targeted by various monoclonal antibodies (vedolizumab, etrolizumab, ontamalimab). Promising preclinical and clinical data with several oral S1P modulators suggest that inhibition of lymphocyte egress from the lymph nodes to the bloodstream might be a safe and efficacious alternative mechanism for reducing inflammation in immune-mediated disorders, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Although various questions remain, including the potential positioning of S1P modulators in treatment algorithms and their long-term safety, this novel class of compounds holds great promise. This Review summarizes the critical mediators and mechanisms involved in immune cell trafficking in IBD and the available evidence for efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of S1P receptor modulators in IBD and other immune-mediated disorders.

The aim of this review was to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral administration of East Asian herbal medicine (EAHM) for inflammatory skin lesions in psoriasis and to explore core herbal materials for drug discovery. A comprehensive search was conducted in 10 electronic databases for randomized controlled trials from their inception until 29 July 2021. Statistical analysis was performed in R version 4.1.2 and R studio. When heterogeneity in studies was detected, the cause was identified through sensitivity analysis, meta-regression, and subgroup analysis. Methodological quality was independently assessed using the revised tool for risk of bias in randomized trials. A total of 56 trials with 4966 psoriasis patients met the selection criteria. Meta-analysis favored EAHM monotherapy on Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 70 (RR: 1.2845; 95% CI: 1.906 to 1.3858, p < 0.0001), PASI 60 (RR: 1.1923; 95% CI: 1.1134 to 1.2769, p < 0.0001), continuous PASI score (MD: −2.3386, 95% CI: −3.3068 to −1.3704, p < 0.0001), IL-17, IL-23, TNF-α, and Dermatology Life Quality Index. Patients treated with EAHM monotherapy had significantly reduced adverse events incidence rate. In addition, based on additional examination of the herb data included in this meta-analysis, 16 core materials were identified. They are utilized in close proximity to one another, and all have anti-inflammatory properties. The findings in this study support that oral EAHM monotherapy may be beneficial for inflammatory skin lesions in psoriasis.

Since carbapenems are considered the last drugs of choice, infections caused by these pathogens are difficult to treat and carry a high risk of mortality. Several antibiotic combination regimens have been utilized for the management of CRE infections or to eradicate colonization in CRE carriers with variable clinical responses. In addition, recent studies have explored the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to eradicate CRE infections. Here, we conducted a systematic review of publications in which FMT was used to eliminate CRE colonization in infected individuals. We searched the PubMed, Cochrane, and Medline databases up to November 30, 2021. Ten studies (209 patients) met the inclusion criteria for this review with three articles describing retrospective cohorts (n = 53 patients) and seven reporting prospective data (n = 156 patients), including one randomized open-label clinical trial. All studies were published between 2017 and 2021 with eight studies from Europe and two from South Korea. There were substantial variations in terms of outcome measurements and study endpoint among these studies. Among the 112 FMT recipients with confirmed CRE colonization, CRE decolonization was reported in 55/90 cases at one month after FMT and at the end of the study follow-up (6–12 months), decolonization was documented in 74/94 (78.7%) patients. The predominant CRE strains reported were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli and the most frequently documented carbapenemases were KPC, OXA-48, and NDM. In general, FMT was well tolerated, with no severe complications reported even in immunosuppressed patients and in those with multiple underlying conditions. In conclusion, FMT appears to be safe and effective in eradicating CRE colonization, however, more studies, especially randomized trials, are needed to validate the safety and clinical utility of FMT for CRE eradication.",,"Antibiotic resistance,Fecal microbiota transplantation,Microbiota,Multidrug-resistant bacteria,Opportunistic infections",10.1016/j.jinf.2022.04.028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2022.04.028

The ampleness of A. muciniphila is notably diminished in obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiometabolic diseases and low-grade inflammation. Furthermore, an inverse relationship between A. muciniphila, body weight and insulin sensitivity has been observed in both humans and animals. Antidiabetic drugs, gastric bypass surgery, prebiotics and biologically active compounds, such as polyphenols or saponins, have been shown to be associated with A. muciniphila relative abundance and thus could have favourable effects on metabolic disorders. Furthermore, A. muciniphila supplementation alone has been correlated with weight reduction and improvement of metabolic disorders, including fat mass gain, adipose tissue inflammation, metabolic endotoxaemia, and insulin resistance.

Remote parts of the root canal system are frequently difficult to clean using irrigation that is mostly done with a syringe and a needle. As a result, various more complex techniques have been introduced. Ultrasonic irrigant activation is probably the most widely used adjunct method, and it has been compared with syringe irrigation in multiple studies. However, very few attempts have been made to summarize the available evidence. Aim: The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of ultrasonic irrigant activation during primary root canal treatment of mature permanent teeth to syringe irrigation in terms of cleansing and disinfecting root canals and healing of apical periodontitis. Methods: An electronic search was conducted of the Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Web of science and Scopus databases using both free-text key words and controlled vocabulary. Additional studies were sought through hand searching of endodontic journals and textbooks. The retrieved studies were screened by 2 reviewers according to predefined criteria. The included studies were critically appraised, and the extracted data were arranged in tables. Results: The manual and automated searches turned up 957 titles, out of which 8 articles were selected for the systematic review. This evaluation comprised of randomized trials and in vitro research. In comparison to syringe irrigation, ultrasonic activation did not speed up the healing of apical periodontitis in teeth having a single root canal. The in vitro microbiological research reported a range of contradictory findings. Ultrasonic activation was superior to syringe irrigation in the removal of pulp tissue fragments and hard tissue debris. Conclusion: As a result of inadequate evidence that was provided, no firm clinical recommendations could be made although ultrasonic activation does provide an alternate debridement mode in curved root canals.",,"cleaning,disinfection Apical periodontitis,irrigation,root canal,ultrasonic activation",,

Methods: A systematic review was carried out following the PRISMA method. The search for scientific evidence was carried out answering the following PICO question: What effect do exclusion diets have on MI in the pediatric population, compared to individuals with a normal diet? Searches were carried out in the Pubmed, Web of Science and Scopus databases, with the inclusion criteria: published in the last 11 years, language in English or Spanish and in humans aged 0 to 17 years. The ROBINS-I program for clinical trials and randomized clinical trials was used to study the risk of bias. Results: 116 articles were found for the lactose-free diet, only 1 was included; 81 articles for the gluten-free diet, 4 were included; Forty-one articles of the low.FODMAPs diet were included, 2 and 25 articles of the ketogenic diet were included, 3. In the lactose-free diet, a change is observed after the introduction of dairy foods, highlighting the increase in the levels of fecal lactic acid bacteria, in particular the genus Lactococcus. MI is different in healthy individuals than in those with untreated celiac disease (CD) and in those with CD treated with a gluten-free diet. In individuals with CD, higher levels of Enterobacteria were found, and a greater presence of E. Coli, and lower levels of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Studies were found that a gluten-free diet positively affects MI in children with CD, several studies found that a gluten-free diet is not enough to restore MI in healthy children. In the studies with diet FODMAPs, they show a reduction of bacteria involved in symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome. In the Ketogenic diet studies, an improvement in the microbial pattern and improvement of the symptoms of refractory epilepsy were observed. The risk of bias in the lactose-free diet could not be assessed; there was insufficient information on the gluten-free diet to assess the risk of bias; on the FODMAP diet the risk of bias was very low and on the ketogenic diet the risk of bias could not be assessed due to lack of data. Conclusions: Changes in MI are evident after exclusion of lactose, gluten, reduction of FODMAPs and the consumption of a ketogenic diet. More well-designed and long-term studies are necessary for greater evidence of these changes and the impact they may have on the health of children and adults, including exclusion diets in healthy children and/or adolescents.

The methodological quality of the included cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Cochrane risk of bias tool, respectively. A total of 30 studies were included in the analysis. Compared to non-responders, the microbial structure of patients who responded to FMT had a higher similarity to that of their donors after FMT. Donors of responders (R-d) and non-responders (NR-d) had different microbial taxa, but the results were inconsistent. After FMT, several beneficial short-chain fatty acids- (SCFA-) producing taxa, such as Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium, Roseburia, and species belonging to them, were enriched in responders, while pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Escherichia-Shigella) belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria were decreased. Alterations of microbial functional genes and metabolites were also observed. In conclusion, the response to FMT was associated with the gut microbiota and their metabolites.

In this study we address potential limitations of operating room heterogeneity of infections and compliance with behavioral interventions following adoption into clinical practice. Design: A post-implementation prospective case-cohort study. Setting: Twenty-three operating rooms at a large teaching hospital. Patients: A total of 801 surgical patients [425 (53%) women; 350 (44%) ASA > 2, age 54.6 ± 15.9 years] were analyzed for the primary and 804 for the secondary outcomes. Interventions: A multifaceted, evidence-based intraoperative infection control program involving hand hygiene, vascular care, and environmental cleaning improvements was implemented for 23 operating room environments. Bacterial transmission monitoring was used to provide monthly feedback for intervention optimization. Measurements: S. aureus transmission (primary) and surgical site infection (secondary). Materials and methods: The incidence of S. aureus transmission and surgical site infection before (3.5 months) and after (4.5 months) infection control optimization was assessed. Optimization was defined by a sustained reduction in anesthesia work area bacterial reservoir isolate counts. Poisson regression with robust error variances was used to estimate the incidence risk ratio (IRR) of intraoperative S. aureus transmission and surgical site infection for the independent variable of optimization. Main results: Optimization was associated with decreased S. aureus transmission [24% before (85/357) to 9% after (42/444), IRR 0.39, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.56, P <.001] and surgical site infections [8% before (29/360) and 3% after (15/444) (IRR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.77, P =.005; adjusted for American Society of Anesthesiologists' physical status, aIRR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.82, P =.009].

Moreover, European countries set daily requirements of total fiber and do not specify any types. Objective: This systematic review appraised data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of the types of fibers beneficial for patients in the treatment of IBD to guide dietary fiber advice. Data Sources: The PubMED database was searched following PRISMA guidelines. Data Extraction: RCTs evaluating the effects of any type of fiber on clinical and physiological outcomes in patients with IBD were assessed. Quality assessment of the selected full-text articles was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Data Analysis: Eight studies were included reporting on 5 types of fibers. In 2 RCTs, germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) was shown to lower pro-inflammatory cytokines and clinical disease activity scores. Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) were demonstrated to lower IBD Questionnaire scores (lower well-being), in contrast to inulin, which decreased disease activity scores. An RCT could not find lower remission rates in the psyllium treatment group, while another RCT reported that administration led to less symptoms in patients. In RCTs, no concrete evidence was found that wheat bran improves disease course. Conclusions: Although the evidence is sparse, GBF and inulin seem propitious and merit further exploration. Evidence on wheat bran and psyllium is still too limited. Adequately powered long-term human RCTs with objective outcomes are needed to improve dietary advice on types of fiber in IBD.",,"Dietary fibers,dietary recommendations,Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)",10.1093/nutrit/nuab062,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nutrit/nuab062

Aims: We aimed to systematically review the efficacy and safety of medical interventions for the prevention and treatment of ICI-associated enterocolitis. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort and case–control studies, and case series/reports, evaluating interventions (including corticosteroids, biologics, aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, and fecal transplantation) for ICI-associated enterocolitis. Clinical, endoscopic, and histologic efficacy endpoints were evaluated. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria were used to assess overall quality of evidence. Results: A total of 160 studies (n = 1514) were included (one RCT, 3 retrospective cohort studies, 156 case reports/case series). Very low quality evidence from one RCT suggests budesonide is not effective for prevention of ICI-associated enterocolitis in ipilimumab-treated patients (relative risk 0.93 [95% confidence interval 0.56, 1.56]). Very low quality evidence suggests that corticosteroids, infliximab, and vedolizumab may be effective for treatment of ICI-associated enterocolitis by inducing clinical response and remission. No validated indices for measuring disease activity were used. Biologic treatment was used in 42% (641/1528) of patients, as reported in 97 studies. ICIs were discontinued in 65% (457/702) of patients, as reported in 63 studies.

Date of Publication: 1 Apr 2022,Frontiers in Microbiology,2022,13,,,,1-Apr-22,Review,1664-302X (electronic),"The exact pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains largely unknown. While current management strategies are effective at stabilizing the disease or relief the symptoms, new approaches are required to target underlying disease process and reverse lung function deterioration. Recent research showed that pneumonia bacteria is critical in disease progression and gut microbiome is likely perturbed in COPD, which is usually accompanied by a decreased intestinal microbial diversity and a disturbance in immune system, contributing to a chronic inflammation. The cross-talk between gut microbes and lungs, termed as the “gut-lung axis,” is known to impact immune response and homeostasis in the airway. Although the gut and respiratory microbiota exhibit compositional differences, the gut and lung showed similarities in the origin of epithelia of both gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, the anatomical structure, and early-life microbial colonization. Evidence showed that respiratory infection might be prevented, or at least dampened by regulating gut microbial ecosystem; thus, a promising yet understudied area of COPD management is nutrition-based preventive strategies. COPD patient is often deficient in nutrient such as antioxidant, vitamins, and fiber intake. However, further larger-scale randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are required to establish the role of these nutrition-based diet in COPD management. In this review, we highlight the important and complex interaction of microbiota and immune response on gut-lung axis. Further research into the modification and improvement of the gut microbiota and new interventions through diet, probiotics, vitamins, and fecal microbiota transplantation is extreme critical to provide new preventive therapies for COPD.",,"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,COPD,gut-lung axis,microbiota,nutrition",10.3389/fmicb.2022.868086,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.868086

They are of particular interest because these uremic solutes are responsible for the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases. Evidence suggests that the relation between uremic toxins, the microbiome, and its host is altered in patients with chronic kidney disease, with the colon’s motility, epithelial integrity, and absorptive properties also playing an important role. Studies found an alteration of the microbiota composition with differences in species proportion, diversity, and function. Since uremic toxins precursors are generated by the microbiota, multiple therapeutic options are currently being explored to address dysbiosis. While an oral adsorbent can decrease the transport of bacterial metabolites from the intestinal lumen to the blood, dietary measures, supplements (prebiotics, probiotics, and synbi-otics), and antibiotics aim to target directly the gut microbiota composition.

Elevated serum phosphorus levels are an important nontraditional risk factor for bone mineral disease and CVD in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Given that phosphorus concentrations drive other disorders associated with increased CV risk (e.g., endothelial dysfunction, vascular calcification, fibroblast growth factor-23, parathyroid hormone), phosphate is a logical target to improve CV health. Phosphate binders are the only pharmacologic treatment approved for hyperphosphatemia. Although their safety has improved since inception, the mechanism of action leads to characteristics that make ingestion difficult and unpleasant; large pill size, objectionable taste, and multiple pills required for each meal and snack make phosphate binders a burden. Side effects, especially those affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) system, are common with binders, often leading to treatment discontinuation. The presence of “hidden” phosphates in processed foods and certain medications makes phosphate management even more challenging. Owing to these significant issues, most patients on dialysis are not consistently achieving and maintaining target phosphorus concentrations of <5.5 mg/dl, let alone more normal levels of <4.5 mg/dl, indicating novel approaches to improve phosphate management and CV health are needed. Several new nonbinder therapies that target intestinal phosphate absorption pathways have been developed. These include EOS789, which acts on the transcellular pathway, and tenapanor, which targets the dominant paracellular pathway. As observational evidence has established a strong association between phosphorus concentration and clinical outcomes, such as mortality, phosphate is an important target for improving the health of patients with CKD and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).",,"chronic kidney disease,end stage renal disease,hyperphosphatemia,phosphate binder,phosphate management,serum phosphorus",10.1016/j.ekir.2022.01.1055,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2022.01.1055

Diet and antibiotics are known modulators of GM, but the influence of physical exercise in modulating the diversity and abundance of hindgut bacteria is still poorly understood. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the scientific evidence about the effect of physical exercise on GM modulation in subjects with obesity and T2DM. Methods and results: A search in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane and Embase databases using keywords related to gut microbiota, physical exercise and metabolic diseases was performed. Eight clinical studies met the inclusion criteria, six in subjects with obesity and two in individuals with T2DM. In three studies carried out in individuals with obesity, exercise was able to positively modulate the diversity of GM and the abundance of some species of bacteria, mostly by increasing the Bifidobacteriaceae family, and the Bacteroides and Akkermansia genera, and by decreasing the Proteobacteria phylum. The studies in subjects with T2DM found that physical exercise may reduce metabolic endotoxemia markers. Conclusions: Physical exercise may be a beneficial modulation strategy of GM composition in metabolic diseases, specifically aerobic exercises carried out for at least 6 weeks with moderate or high intensity.

As an initial step toward creating a validated instrument, we identified pouchitis disease activity indices, examined their operating properties, and assessed their value as outcome measures in clinical trials. Methods: Electronic databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials including indices that evaluated clinical, endoscopic, or histologic pouchitis disease activity. A second search identified studies that assessed the operating properties of pouchitis indices. Results: Eighteen randomized controlled trials utilizing 4 composite pouchitis disease activity indices were identified. The Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) was most commonly used (12 of 18; 66.7%) to define both trial eligibility (8 of 12; 66.7%), and outcome measures (12 of 12; 100%). In a separate search, 21 studies evaluated the operating properties of 3 pouchitis indices; 90.5% (19 of 21) evaluated validity, of which 42.1% (8 of 19) evaluated the construct validity of the PDAI. Criterion validity (73.7%; 14 of 19) was evaluated through correlation of the PDAI with fecal calprotectin (FCP; r=0.188 to 0.71), fecal lactoferrin (r=0.570 to 0.582), and C-reactive protein (CRP; r=0.584). Two studies assessed correlation of the modified PDAI (mPDAI) with FCP (r=0.476 and r=0.565, respectively). Fair to moderate inter-rater reliability of the PDAI (k=0.440) and mPDAI (k=0.389) was reported in a single study. Responsiveness of the PDAI pre-antibiotic and postantibiotic treatment was partially evaluated in a single study of 12 patients.

The pathophysiology remains poorly understand. In this context, animal models become a very useful tool in this regard, as understanding; the disease may be helpful in developing novel therapeutic methodologies for ACLF. However, although animal models display several similarities to the human condition, they do not represent all ACLF manifestations, resulting in significant challenges. An initial liver cirrhosis framework followed by the induction of an acute decompensation by administering lipopolysaccharide and D-GaIN, potentiating liver damage supports the methodologies applied to induce experimental ACLF. The entire methodology has been described mostly for rats.

Despite the high value of incorporating FMT into practice, there remain concerns about its safety. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been an updated meta-analysis reporting pooled rates of adverse events in FMT for CDI. Methods A search for studies of FMT in patients with CDI was performed with the rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) related to FMT evaluated as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included SAEs unrelated to FMT and minor adverse events associated with FMT. A pooled analysis was then performed. Results Initial search identified 378 reference articles. Data were extracted from the 61 of these studies that met the inclusion criteria, comprising 5099 patients. Pooled analysis showed that SAEs related to FMT developed in less than 1% of patients. The pooled rate of SAEs not related to FMT was higher at 2.9%. The pooled rate of minor adverse events also showed infrequent self-limited gastrointestinal and systemic discomfort.

Prediagnostic and prodromal features, such as constipation and α-synuclein pathology, can be detected several years before the clinical diagnosis of PD and have the potential to develop as early PD biomarkers. Environmental toxins and gut dysbiosis may trigger oxidative stress and mucosal inflammation, and initiate α-synuclein accumulation in the enteric nervous system, early in PD. Chronic gut inflammation can lead to a leaky gut and systemic inflammation, neuro inflammation, and neuro degeneration via gut–vagus–brain signaling or through blood–brain barrier permeability. Concepts regarding the gut–brain signaling in PD pathogenesis are changing rapidly and more investigation is required. The gut microbiota interacts with the human body by modulating the enteric and central nervous systems, and immune activity. Understanding the immune responses between gut microbiota and human body might help in elucidating the PD pathogenesis.

The prevalence of GC among the younger population has been increasing in recent years, and the latter is associated with late detection and advanced disease status. The factors involved in the development of GC have been the focus of investigation in the past few years; yet no consistent conclusions or preventative solutions have been suggested. This scoping review aims to explore and report on research studies conducted to investigate the association between GC, the gut microbiome, and nutritional habits. Recent findings : Using a predefined protocol in compliance with the PRISMA guidelines, a search was conducted on four separate databases including Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, ProQuest, and PubMed to investigate the association between GC, microbiome, and nutrition. A total of 1219 articles were identified through this process. Forty-three articles met the initial screening criteria and following full-article analysis, and 10 articles met the full inclusion criteria and were included in the current review. The results of the study support that there are differences in the gut microbiota between GC patients and healthy controls and that GC patients may have increased microbiota richness and lower diversity compared to healthy controls. In addition, the detection of pre/early GC may be possible through the analysis of the microbiota using fecal sampling. Nutritional habits, probiotics, and antibiotics may also play an important role in affecting GC development. Summary: Preliminary studies support a role for the gut microbiota in developing GC. Yet, the lack of sufficient randomized controlled studies investigating the association between GC, the gut microbiota, and nutritional habits demonstrates the need for further clinical research to develop preventative strategies that will aim to reduce the increased incidence of GC among all age groups including younger populations.",,"Carcinogenesis,Diet,Dysbiosis,Gastric cancer,Microbiome,Nutrition",10.1007/s13668-021-00391-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13668-021-00391-z

In this narrative review, we analyze the rational and the current clinical findings of probiotic use in the management of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in pediatric age, with special focus on infantile colic, irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, and gastroesophageal reflux. Some specific probiotics showed a significant reduction in crying and fussing compared to placebo in breastfed infants with colic, although their exact mechanism of action in this disorder remains poorly understood. In irritable bowel syndrome, a limited number of studies showed that specific strains of probiotics can improve abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating/gassiness, although data are still scarce. As for constipation, whilst some strains appear to reduce the number of hard stools in constipated children, the evidence is not adequate to support the use of probiotics in the management of functional constipation. Similarly, although some probiotic strains could promote gastric emptying with a potential improvement of functional symptoms related to gastroesophageal reflux, current evidence is insufficient to provide any specific recommendation for the prevention or treatment of gastroesophageal reflux.

Two independent reviewers carried out a systematic evaluation of the existing literature in South Africa on environmental and occupational exposures, as well as the health effects faced by informal street food vendors. Methods: 354 published publications were reviewed and 9 were included, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: The evidence showed that informal street vendors are exposed to workplace risks that affect their health and wellbeing. Non-enclosed vendor stalls and frequent use of open fires were among the risk concerns. Vendors are vulnerable to gastrointestinal diseases such as salmonellosis and respiratory infections such as influenza and COVID-19 due to inadequate access to water, waste disposal facilities, and basic hygiene awareness and practices. Exposure to air pollutants increased the risk of respiratory and urinary illnesses and an impact on the reproductive health of female street vendors. Conclusions: This investigation demonstrated the difficulties in complying with the requirements of the Regulations Governing General Hygiene Requirements for Food Premises, the Transport of Food, and Related Matters (no. R638 of 22 June 2018) and the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Act (no. 85 of 1993). Within South African borders, there is a scarcity of research on occupational exposures and health effects in this occupation. As a result, eliminating or preventing these occupational exposures should be at the top of government and stakeholder agendas.

Recently, ultraviolet (UV) light and hydrogen peroxide have increasingly been used as innovative decontamination methods. Hence, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate which decontamination methods are effective in reducing environmental C. difficile contamination. We systematically searched the EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Ichushi until March 11, 2021. We evaluated the efficacy of decontamination methods in terms of the frequency of C. difficile contamination on high-touch surfaces in hospital rooms and the incidence of hospital-acquired C. difficile infection. Among the 15 studies retrieved in our meta-analysis, eight evaluated decontamination methods with the frequency of C. difficile detection among samples after disinfection procedures, and eight reported the number of hospital-acquired CDI cases. Pooled analysis indicated that hydrogen peroxide significantly reduced the frequency of environmental C. difficile contamination, compared with hypochlorite (odds ratios [OR]: 0.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07–0.23). Additionally, hydrogen peroxide reduced the incidence of hospital-acquired CDI compared to other methods (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.28–0.96). Decontamination with UV significantly reduced the incidence of hospital-acquired CDI compared to hypochlorite (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28–0.96).

Researchers and implementers concerned with these insecurities have demonstrated that there are notable interactions between them resulting in significant psychological and biological outcomes. Recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in Bangladesh, Kenya (WASH Benefits) and Zimbabwe (SHINE) demonstrated no effect from water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions on linear growth, and mixed evidence on enteropathogen burden and risk of diarrhoea in young children. These data suggest a need for a more comprehensive understanding of WASH security. The risks posed by multiple resource insecurities shift depending on the individual, their movement throughout their day, their economically and socially prescribed roles, and ecological features such as seasonality and precipitation. By more fully integrating food, water and sanitation security in interventions and subsequent impact evaluations, we can achieve WASH security—one that addresses myriad transmission pathways and co-occurring diseases—that ultimately would improve health outcomes throughout the world.

Because of the storage temperature, bacterial contamination of PCs can result in life-threatening infections in transfused patients. The potential of blood components to cause infections through contaminating pathogens or transmitting blood-borne diseases has always been a concern. The current safety practice to prevent pathogen transmission through blood transfusion starts with a stringent screening of donors and regulated testing of blood samples to ensure that known infections cannot reach transfusion products. Pathogen reduction technologies (PRTs), initially implemented to ensure the safety of plasma products, have been adapted to treat platelet products. In addition to reducing bacterial contamination, PRT applied to PCs can extend their shelf life up to 7 days, alleviating the impact of their shortage, while providing an additional safety layer against emerging blood-borne infectious diseases. While a deleterious action of PRTs in quantitative and qualitative aspects of plasma is accepted, the impact of PRTs on the quality, function, and clinical efficacy of PCs has been under constant examination. The potential of PRTs to prevent the possibility of new emerging diseases to reach cellular blood components has been considered more hypothetical than real. In 2019, a coronavirus-related disease (COVID-19) became a pandemic. This episode should help when reconsidering the possibility of future blood transmissible threats.

Areas covered: We have critically appraised available evidence through a structured literature review, investigating effective empiric antibiotic administration and appropriateness on outcomes of critically ill patients with an increased risk of developing resistant pathogens. The use of new antibiotics should be determined based on relevant knowledge of their spectrum and properties to provide effective mode of action for critically ill patients. Expert Opinion: Restricting severely ill patients access to new broad-spectrum empirical drugs is not the answer. Rather there should be a focus on identifying host response to infection to differentiate between colonization or contamination and true infection, and the sensitivity to antibiotics used in the intensive care unit (ICU). Management relies on adequate antibiotic administration, the ability to monitor response, and facilitate the cessation of antibiotic treatment. The major determinant of patient success in a patient with a severe infection is the ‘right’ antibiotic or complementary course of treatment.

Study design: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating nonpharmacologic treatments in children with functional constipation which reported at least 1 outcome of the core outcome set for children with functional constipation. Results: We included 52 RCTs with 4668 children, aged between 2 weeks and 18 years, of whom 47% were females. Studied interventions included gut microbiome-directed interventions, other dietary interventions, oral supplements, pelvic floor-directed interventions, electrical stimulation, dry cupping, and massage therapy.

However, the efficacy and safety of SBS in treating chronic diarrhea have not been fully assessed. Objective: This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of the herbal formula SBS in symptomatic relief of chronic diarrhea. Methods: English and Chinese language databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal Database, Wanfang Data, and SinoMed electronic databases) were searched through April 2020 for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The outcomes in these RCTs included stool frequency, stool consistency, patient-reported satisfaction of chronic diarrhea treatment, quality of life and adverse events. Paired reviewers independently extracted data and conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses. The Cochrane revised risk of bias RoB-2 tool was applied to assess the risk of bias for each trial whereas the RevMan 5.3 software was used for outcomes data synthesis and meta-analysis. Mean difference (MD) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to measure continuous data. The dichotomous data were analyzed via the relative risk (RR) with 95% CIs. Results: Fourteen RCTs including 1158 participants (54% males) with chronic diarrhea were included. Shenling Baizhu San combined with or without conventional medicine (CM) was associated with greater patient-reported satisfaction than CM alone. There was no increased risk of adverse events (AEs) during treatment. Conclusion: Treatment with SBS was associated with significant improvement in patient-reported satisfaction, irrespective of conventional medicine use.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic recurrent inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an emerging therapy that modifies the patient's gut microbiota by transplanting feces from a healthy donor to achieve disease remission. However, its efficacy and safety need to be further investigated. Methods. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar databases (up to 8th November 2021) were searched and literature was screened by title and abstract as well as full text. The primary outcome was clinical remission, with the clinical response as a secondary outcome. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. Results. A total of 14 trials were included in this study. In terms of clinical remission, FMT had a significant effect compared to placebo (RR = 1.44, 95 CI%: 1.03 to 2.02, I2 = 38%, P=0.03), with no significant risk of study heterogeneity. Moreover, FMT led to significant results in clinical response compared to placebo with moderate between-study heterogeneity (RR = 1.34, 95 CI%: 0.92 to 1.94, I2 = 51%, P=0.12). Subgroup analysis showed a higher clinical remission for fresh fecal FMT (40.9%) than that for frozen fecal FMT (32.2%); the efficacy of gastrointestinal (GI) pretreatment, the severity of disease, route of administration, and the donor selection remain unclear and require more extensive study. Safety analysis concluded that most adverse events were mild and self-resolving. The microbiological analysis found that the patient's gut microbiota varied in favor of the donor, with increased flora diversity and species richness. Conclusion. FMT is a safe, effective, and well-tolerated therapy. Studies have found that fresh fecal microbiota transplant can increase clinical remission rates.

Date of Publication: 2022,Canadian Journal of Infectious Diseases and Medical Microbiology,2022,2022,,,,2022,Article,"1918-1493 (electronic),1712-9532","According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, approximately 62,050 people were living with HIV in Canada in 2018, and of those, 13% were undiagnosed. Currently, no single strategy provides complete protection or is universally effective across all demographic groups at risk for HIV. However, HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the newest HIV prevention strategy that shows promise. To date, two products have received an indication for PrEP by Health Canada: emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada®; FTC/TDF) and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Descovy®; FTC/TAF). Despite the high efficacy of these PrEP intervention methods, access to PrEP in Canada remains low. Identifying and addressing barriers to PrEP access, especially in high-risk groups, are necessary to reduce HIV transmission in Canada. While guidelines published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) include FTC/TAF information, the efficacy of FTC/TAF for PrEP has not yet been considered in Canada's clinical practice guidelines. Thus, the current paper reviews data regarding the use of FTC/TDF and FTC/TAF for PrEP, which may be useful for Canadian healthcare providers when counseling and implementing HIV prevention methods. The authors highlight these data in relation to various at-risk populations and review ongoing clinical trials investigating novel PrEP agents. Overall, FTC/TDF PrEP is effective for many populations, including men who have sex with men, transgender women, heterosexuals with partners living with HIV, and people who use drugs. While there is fewer data reported on the efficacy of FTC/TAF to date, recent clinical trials have demonstrated noninferiority of FTC/TAF in comparison to FTC/TDF. Notably, as studies have shown that FTC/TAF maintains renal function and bone mineral density to a greater extent than FTC/TDF, FTC/TAF may be a safer option for patients experiencing renal and/or bone dysfunction, for those at risk of renal and bone complications, and for those who develop FTC/TDF-related adverse events.",,,10.1155/2022/3913439,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/3913439

A systematic review on outcome measures of long-term efficacy in clinical trials concerning crohn's disease patients,,"Janssen L., Creemers R., Van Bodegraven A., Pierik M.",,3/1/22,Journal of Crohn's and Colitis (2022) 16 Supplement 1 (i248-i249). Date of Publication: 1 Jan 2022,Journal of Crohn's and Colitis,2022,16,,i248,i249,1-Jan-22,Conference Abstract,1876-4479,"Background: Treatment goals for Crohn's disease (CD) tend to shift from clinical towards endoscopic remission as a potential means to reduce intestinal damage. Additionally, sustained corticosteroid (CS) free remission is warranted to prevent drug related side effects. In clinical trials, long-term efficacy of treatment is assessed by a range of outcome measures at variable time points. Besides clinical activity, it is recommended by the EMA to measure biochemical and endoscopic activity, given the poor correlation between commonly applied clinical activity indices and mucosal inflammation. Finally, STRIDE advices to add a PROM given the frequent perception gap in disease control between patient and health care professionals. Moreover, the relapsing-remitting nature of CD challenges timing of efficacy evaluations. Use of cross-sectional outcomes only on predetermined moments disregards the health status in between these measurements. In this systematic review, we provide an overview of the outcomes employed to assess long-term efficacy of maintenance (drug) therapy or treatment strategies in randomized controlled trials and their open label extensions in CD patients. Methods: A systematic search of Pubmed and Embase databases was performed. Giving the emerging treatment goals, the search was restricted to trials published since 2007. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts and selected eligible trials. We assessed whether and when long-term (i.e. >48 weeks) clinical, biochemical and/or endoscopic efficacy outcomes were used. In addition, data on patient perspective and CS use were collected. Results: Sixty-seven out of 1947 articles were included (figure 1). Clinical activity indices were used in 66 studies (99%) as long-term efficacy outcome, with 20 studies (30%) taking into account concomitant CS use. C-reactive protein concentration was (part of) an outcome in 29 studies (43%), and faecal calprotectin in 15 studies (22%). Endoscopic activity was evaluated in 30 studies (45%). PROMs were used in 29 studies (43%), with IBDQ being the most frequently used. Seven studies measure long-term clinical, biochemical, endoscopic activity and patient perspective, in three studies a sustained CS free status as part of the outcome was required (table 1). In most studies cross-sectional measures or multiple measurements over time, so-called panel data, were used. Conclusion: We established a lack of objective outcome measures of inflammation and patient perspective in clinical trials in CD, consequently missing pivotal data to evaluate current treatment goals. Additionally, cross-sectional outcomes on fixed time points were mostly applied, resulting in loss of efficacy information in chronic relapsing-remitting diseases.",,,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjab232.311,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjab232.311

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the clinical effects and safety of CGEC for IBS-D were included. Global improvement of IBS-D symptoms was used as the primary outcome. The data were analyzed by RevMan 5.3 software. Risk ratio (RR) calculations and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) with 95% CI were used for continuous outcomes. Results: Twelve RCTs involving 1232 participants were included. Compared with western conventional medicine (WCM) alone (i.e. gastrointestinal spasmodic and probiotics), CGEC demonstrated no significant differences in global improvement of IBS-D symptoms (RR 1.09, 95% CI [0.97, 1.23]), reduction in stool frequency (MD 0.14, 95% CI [-0.18, 0.46]) and relief of abdominal pain (MD 0.12, 95% CI [-0.27, 0.52]). The combination of CGEC and WCM had advantages over WCM alone in terms of global improvement of IBS-D symptoms (RR 1.37, 95% CI [1.25, 1.49]). Regarding the recurrence rate, both the CGEC group and the combined drug group were lower than the WCM group. In terms of safety, there is currently no evidence to suggest that CGEC can cause adverse reactions/events in patients with IBS-D.

In bacteremia, this pathogen is associated with higher mortality than other Gram-negative pathogens. This increase in mortality was also found globally for multi-resistant compared to susceptible strains. Several factors have been associated with the development of resistance: previous ICU stay, use of carbapenems, and comorbidities were identified in multivariate analysis. In the therapeutic choice, previous antibiotic treatment remains the strongest driver suggesting a potential resistant strain. These risk factors will decide whether multi-resistant strains must be considered in the empiric coverage. For susceptible strains, a single agent can be used, β-lactams are usually the first choice. Associations do not provide any advantage on mortality. Optimization of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters, such as prolonged infusion (for time-dependent antibiotics), increased dosage (for concentration-dependent antibiotics), and therapeutic drug monitoring, also influences the outcome. The increasing number of resistant strains led the clinician to use either recently approved new molecules but also associations. For multi-resistant strains, new molecules such as ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, and cefiderocol have shown an adequate activity against P. aeruginosa. Older molecules like colistin and fosfomycin are also used in this indication. The complexity of the resistance and consequences on a larger scale of antibiotic prescription will probably lead to more individualized prescriptions.",,"Bloodstream infections,Multidrug resistance,P. aeruginosa,Ventilator-associated pneumonia",10.1007/978-3-031-08491-1_16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-08491-1_16

Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) is an important morbidity in cystic fibrosis. It is the result of the accumulation of viscid faecal material within the bowel which combines with thick, sticky mucus produced in the intestines of people with cystic fibrosis. The intestine may be completely blocked (complete DIOS) or only partially blocked (incomplete DIOS). Once a diagnosis of DIOS has been made, the goal of therapy is to relieve the acute complete or incomplete faecal obstruction and ultimately prevent the need for surgical intervention. Objectives: This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different treatment regimens for the treatment of DIOS (complete and incomplete) in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of search: 09 September 2021. We also searched online trial registries. Date of last search: 12 October 2021. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials (including cross-over trials (to be judged on an individual basis)) comparing the use of laxative agents or surgery for treating DIOS in children, young people and adults with cystic fibrosis to each other, placebo or no intervention. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed for risk of bias. The authors assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. Main results: There was one trial with 20 participants (16 females) included in the review. The mean age of participants was 13.1 years. The trial was a double-blinded, randomised cross-over trial which had a duration of 12 months in total and compared high-dose and low-dose pancreatic enzyme therapy. As only the abstract of the trial was available, the overall risk of bias was judged to be unclear. The trial did not address either of our primary outcomes (time until resolution of DIOS and treatment failure rate), but reported episodes of acute DIOS, presence of abdominal mass and abdominal pain. There were no numerical data available for these outcomes, but the authors stated that there was no difference between treatment with high-dose or low-dose pancreatic enzymes. The overall certainty of the evidence was found to be very low. Authors' conclusions: There is a clear lack of evidence for the treatment of DIOS in people with cystic fibrosis. The included abstract did not address our primary outcome measures and did not provide numerical data for the two secondary outcomes it did address. Therefore, we cannot justify the use of high-dose pancreatic enzymes for treating DIOS, nor can we comment on the efficacy and safety of other laxative agents.

HIV infection adversely influences the richness and diversity of the intestinal microbiome, resulting in structural and functional impairment of the intestinal barrier and an increased intestinal permeability. Pathogens and metabolites may thus cross the “leaky” intestinal barrier and enter the systemic circulation, which is a significant factor accounting for the persistent underlying chronic inflammatory state present in people living with HIV (PLWH). Additionally, alcohol use and abuse has been found to be prevalent in PLWH and has been strongly associated with the incidence and progression of HIV/AIDS. Recently, converging evidence has indicated that the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is related to intestinal microbiome and barrier function through numerous pathways. Alcohol acts as a “partner” with HIV in disrupting microbiome ecology, and thus impairing of the intestinal barrier. Optimizing the microbiome and restoring the integrity of the intestinal barrier is likely to be an effective adjunctive therapeutic strategy for PLWH.

Six in 10 people lacked access to safely managed sanitation facilities in 2015. Numerous community- and school-based approaches have been implemented to eradicate open defecation practices, promote latrine ownership, improve situation sanitation, and reduce waterborne disease. Objective: Given that current evidence for sanitation interventions seem promising, the aim of this study was to systematically summarize existing research on the effectiveness of community- and school-based randomized controlled sanitation intervention in improving (1) free open defecation (safe feces disposal), (2) latrine usage, (3) latrine coverage or access, and (4) improved latrine coverage or access. Methods: Eight electronic databases were searched: PubMed, Scopus, WHO Global Health Library (GHL), Virtual Health Library (VHL), POPLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar up to 26 April 2019. Original randomized clinical trials addressing community-based or school-based intervention that reported feces disposal and latrine coverage were deemed eligible. More than two researchers independently contributed to screening of papers, data extraction, and bias assessment. We conducted a meta-analysis by random-effects model. The risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: Eighteen papers that matched all criteria and 16 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Compared to the control, the sanitation intervention significantly increased safe feces disposal (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.51–3.19, p < 0.05, I(2) = 97.28), latrine usage (OR 3.72, 95% CI 1.71–8.11, p < 0.05, I(2) = 91.52), latrine coverage or access (OR 3.95, 95% CI 2.08–7.50, p < 0.05, I(2) = 99.07), and improved latrine coverage or access (OR 3.68, 95% CI 1.52–8.91, p < 0.05, I(2) = 99.11). A combination of education and latrine construction was more effective compared to educational intervention alone.

Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2021,Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology,2021,14,,,,1-Dec-21,Review,"1756-2848 (electronic),1756-283X","Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infection attributing to substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. Recurrent CDI (rCDI) is common and occurs after effective treatment of first episode. Treatment of rCDI is based on accurate diagnoses, due to difficulty in distinguishing between colonization of C. difficile spores or CDI; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) added to the complexity of diagnoses as both entities can co-occur. It is difficult to eradicate rCDI, and there remains a critical gap regarding treatment of rCDI. The treatment goal of rCDI is to reestablish normal microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is suggested as a treatment for second episode of rCDI. Based on the collective evidence of all randomized controlled trials, FMT was reported more efficacious compared with vancomycin or fidaxomicin; however, these trials had limited number of patients and all patients were pre-treated with vancomycin prior to FMT. Furthermore, when comparing various routes of instillation and types of preparation of fecal microbiota, no difference was observed in cure rate. Despite the success rate of FMT, there remains a concern for transmission of infectious agents, such as Gram negative bacteremia or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), adverse events (diarrhea and abdominal pain), and reports of new diagnoses (inflammatory bowel disease, weight gain and irritable bowel syndrome). To lessen the risk of transmissible infections, donor screening should be performed, which includes screening for medical comorbidities and infectious pathogens in blood and feces. Scheduling complexities and reimbursement places an additional roadblock for using FMT. Microbiome-based therapies are being developed to eliminate the logistical challenges related to FMT. Large prospective and placebo-controlled studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and long-term safety of FMT, so its use can be justified in clinical practice.",,"Clostridioides difficile,fecal microbiota transplantation",10.1177/17562848211053105,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/17562848211053105

Although the etiology of this syndrome is likely heterogenous, it presents with its hallmark symptoms of abdominal pain and altered intestinal motility. Moreover, it is considered to be a disorder of the gut-brain interaction, and the microbiome has often been implicated as a central player in its pathophysiology. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome display altered composition and function of the gut microbiota compared to healthy controls. Microbiome direct-ed therapies, such as probiotics, antibiotics and fecal micro-biome transplantation, appear to be beneficial for both gut symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities.

The heightened interest is accompanied by concerns over adverse events (AE) and safety. To further understand that in FMT, we performed a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of high-quality, prospective randomized controlled trials FMT. Methods Studies were selected based on predefined exclusion criteria and were assessed for quality. Only prospective, randomized, controlled studies of high quality were included in the final analysis. Data were extracted on demographics, AE, indication, delivery method and follow-up duration. Results Out of 334 articles reviewed, 9 high quality studies with 756 FMTs were selected for final analysis. The pooled rate of AE was 39.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19-0.642) as they were reported by 112 patients who received FMT. The SAE rate was 5.3% (95%CI 3.1-8.8%). The most common AE reported was abdominal pain, followed by diarrhea. The most common SAE was Clostridium difficile infection. Upper gastrointestinal tract delivery was associated with a higher rate of total AE, but not SAE. Conclusions Based on the selected studies, the AE rate of FMT is 39.3%, with most AE being mild and self-limiting. SAE were uncommon at 5.3%, and many were only possibly related to the FMT.

Plasma TMAO increases following consumption of red meat. This metabolic change is thought to be partly because of the expansion of gut microbes able to use nutrients abundant in red meat. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used data from a randomized crossover study to estimate the degree to which TMAO can be es-timated from fecal microbial composition. Healthy participants received a series of 3 diets that differed in protein source (red meat, white meat, and non-meat), and fecal, plasma, and urine samples were collected following 4 weeks of exposure to each diet. TMAO was quantitated in plasma and urine, while shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on fecal DNA. While the cai gene cluster was weakly correlated with plasma TMAO (rho=0.17, P=0.0007), elastic net models of TMAO were not improved by abundances of bacterial genes known to contribute to TMAO synthesis. A global analysis of all taxonomic groups, genes, and gene families found no meaningful predictors of TMAO. We postulated that abundances of known genes related to TMAO production do not predict bacterial metabolism, and we measured choline-and carnitine-trimethylamine lyase activity during fecal culture. Trimethylamine lyase genes were only weakly correlated with the activity of the enzymes they encode. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal microbiome composition does not predict systemic TMAO because, in this case, gene copy number does not predict bacterial metabolic activity.

Although IBS is a benign condition, it reduces the quality of life considerably. While there is currently no effective treatment for this disorder, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) seems to be promising. Purpose: The aim of this review was to analysis possible factors affecting the success or failure of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of FMT for IBS and highlighting the gaps in our knowledge that need to be filled and of sketching a possible model for successful FMT in IBS patients. Methods: A systematic search was conducted of literature published in English from January 2015 to December 2020 using the keywords: fecal microbiota transplantation, randomized trials, and IBS. Key Results: Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of FMT for IBS were found in the literature. Four of the seven RCTs found various positive effects, while the other three did not find any effect. Conclusions and Inferences: The efficacy of FMT for IBS appears to be donor-dependent. The effective (super) donor would need to have a favorable microbiota signature, and 11 clinical criteria that are known to be associated with a favorable microbiota have been suggested for selecting FMT donors for IBS. Comparing the microbiota of the effective donors with those of healthy subjects would reveal the favorable microbiota signature required for a super-donor. However, the studies reviewed were not designed to compare efficacy of different donor types. The dose of the fecal transplant is also an important factor influencing the outcome of FMT for IBS. However, further studies designed to test the effect of fecal transplant dose are needed to answer this question. Administering the fecal transplant to either the small or large intestine seems to be effective, but the optimal route of administration remains to be determined. Moreover, whether single or repeated FMT is more effective is also still unclear. A 1-year follow-up of IBS patients who received FMT showed that adverse events of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation were both mild and self-limiting.",,"fecal transplant,microbiota,short-chain fatty acids,super-donor,therapy",10.1111/nmo.14157,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nmo.14157

LT success can be hampered by several short-term and long-term complications. Among them, bacterial infections, especially those due to multidrug-resistant germs, are particularly frequent, with a prevalence between 19 and 33% in the first 100 days after transplantation. In the last decades, a number of studies have highlighted how the gut microbiota (GM) is involved in several essential functions to ensure intestinal homeostasis, becoming one of the most important virtual metabolic organs. The GM works through different axes with other organs, and the gut-liver axis is among the most relevant and investigated ones. Any alteration or disruption of the GM is defined as dysbiosis. Peculiar phenotypes of GM dysbiosis have been associated with several liver conditions and complications, such as chronic hepatitis, fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, there is growing evidence of the crucial role of the GM in shaping the immune response, both locally and systemically, against pathogens. This paves the way to the manipulation of the GM as a therapeutic instrument to modulate infectious risk and outcome.

Currently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) recommend metronidazole and/or vancomycin for pediatric CDI depending on disease severity. Recently however, the first and only RCT of CDI treatment in children demonstrated fidaxomicin to be non-inferior to vancomycin, proving its safety and efficacy in this population. Additionally, observational data published since the IDSA/SHEA guidelines were released suggest metronidazole has lower rates of clinical improvement when compared to vancomycin in hospitalized children with non-severe CDI.

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2021,Blood,2021,138,SUPPL 1,4869,,1-Nov-21,Conference Abstract,1528-0020,"Introduction: In recent years, there has been an expanding focus on interplay between intestinal microbiotal diversity and outcome of acute graft versus host disease(GVHD) in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) recipients. One of the compelling intervention to maintain healthy gut microbiota for better outcome of GVHD in HCT recipients is Fecal microbial transplantation(FMT). Several non randomized small clinical studies and case reports on the efficacy and safety of FMT were reported so far. However, the ultimate role of FMT as a therapeutic option to treat GVHD is yet to be determined due to lack of randomised, large scale, statistically significant studies. Here in, we report a systemic review of literature available so far in an effort to establish a definite role of FMT. Methodology: A systemic literature search was conducted using various electronic databases. The case reports, case series and clinical studies related to FMT were used as a therapeutic or preventative modality specifically for GVHD are included. Results: Upon pooling of data, 87 patients from 6 studies and 5 case reports were included in the study in which complete remission(CR) occured in 43.7% and partial remission(PR) occured in 20.7% patients which is equivalent to 64.4% overall response rate in treating GVHD. Furthermore, out of all the species in fecal matter, clostridium was found to be the most valuable species in decreasing the rates of GVHD re-occurrence. Only a limited number of patients had treatment-related mortality (TRM) from GVHD while few showed mild GI-related (abdominal pain/distention, nausea, regurgitation) and non-GI adverse reactions including infections, anemia, thrombocytopenia, paroxysmal, and atrial fibrillation. We emphasize that the most of the patients did not have any major complications after FMT. Conclusion: We conclude that the FMT is a safe and effective strategy for the management of GVHD based on our study. The establishment of gut diversity along with the patient's intrinsic factors like fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) secretor status and baseline gut microbial diversity play a major role in the success of FMT. Given the restricted size and absence of randomized data, one cannot portray FMT as a standard of care yet, however, the low or absent toxicity along with improvement in survival justifies this modality to be tested in a randomized fashion. We strongly encourage the transplant community to enroll patients in innovative trials utilizing FMT, as this may be a one of the safest strategies for both prevention and treatment of GVHD.",,,10.1182/blood-2021-151904,http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood-2021-151904

The pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of PPIs, however, are influenced by genetic factors such as variants in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes (e.g., cytochrome P450 2C19 [CYP2C19]) and drug transporters. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the influence of CYP2C19 genotype and PPI class, PPI dose, treatment duration and clarithromycin dose on the cure rate of PPI-containing Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. Methods: Randomized control trials (RCTs) investigating cure rates using a PPI-amoxicillin-clarithromycin regimen among different CYP2C19 genotypes through May 2021 were included. Results: A total of 25 studies (5,318 patients) were included. The overall eradication rate in the intention-to-treat analysis was 79.0% (3,689/4,669, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.8–80.2%), and that in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers (EMs), intermediate metabolizer (IMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) was 77.7% (1,137/1,464, 95% CI: 75.3–79.6%), 81.2% (1,498/1,844, 95% CI: 79.3–83.0%) and 86.8% (644/742, 95% CI: 83.9–88.9%), respectively. Meta-analysis showed that the relaTakashitive risk of failed eradication in CYP2C19 EMs compared with IMs and PMs was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.06–1.39, P = 0.006) and 1.57 (95% CI: 1.27–1.94, P < 0.001), respectively, in the fixed-effects model. The cure rate of omeprazole and lansoprazole-containing eradication regimens differed among CYP2C19 genotypes (P < 0.05), while that of rabeprazole and esomeprazole-containing regimens was similar. Conclusion: The cure rates of PPI-amoxicillin-clarithromycin H. pylori eradication regimen, especially those containing omeprazole and lansoprazole, differ among CYP2C19 genotypes. Therefore, selection of a second-generation PPI or tailored treatment may achieve higher eradication rates than first-generation PPI-amoxicillin-clarithromycin triple regimen.",,"CYP2C19,eradication,esomeprazole,H. pylori,rebaprezole,tailored treatment",10.3389/fphar.2021.759249,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.759249

Inadequate water and sanitation services, compounded by exposure to flooding and climate change risks, expose inhabitants to environmental contamination causing poor health and wellbeing and degrading ecosystems. However, the exact nature and full scope of risks and exposure pathways between human health and the environment in informal settlements are uncertain. Existing models are limited to microbiological linkages related to faecal-oral exposures at the individual level, and do not account for a broader range of human-environmental variables and interactions that affect population health and wellbeing. Methods: We undertook a 12-month health and environmental assessment in 12 flood-prone informal settlements in Makassar, Indonesia. We obtained caregiver-reported health data, anthropometric measurements, stool and blood samples from children < 5 years, and health and wellbeing data for children 5–14 years and adult respondents. We collected environmental data including temperature, mosquito and rat species abundance, and water and sediment samples. Demographic, built environment and household asset data were also collected. We combined our data with existing literature to generate a novel planetary health model of health and environment in informal settlements. Results: Across the 12 settlements, 593 households and 2764 participants were enrolled. Two-thirds (64·1%) of all houses (26·3–82·7% per settlement) had formal land tenure documentation. Cough, fever and diarrhoea in the week prior to the survey were reported among an average of 34.3%, 26.9% and 9.7% of children aged < 5 years, respectively; although proportions varied over time, prevalence among these youngest children was consistently higher than among children 5–14 years or adult respondents. Among children < 5 years, 44·3% experienced stunting, 41·1% underweight, 12.4% wasting, and 26.5% were anaemic. There was self- or carer-reported poor mental health among 16.6% of children aged 5–14 years and 13.9% of adult respondents. Rates of potential risky exposures from swimming in waterways, eating uncooked produce, and eating soil or dirt were high, as were exposures to flooding and livestock. Just over one third of households (35.3%) had access to municipal water, and contamination of well water with E. coli and nitrogen species was common. Most (79·5%) houses had an in-house toilet, but no houses were connected to a piped sewer network or safe, properly constructed septic tank. Median monthly settlement outdoor temperatures ranged from 26·2 °C to 29.3 °C, and were on average, 1·1 °C warmer inside houses than outside. Mosquito density varied over time, with Culex quinquefasciatus accounting for 94·7% of species. Framed by a planetary health lens, our model includes four thematic domains: (1) the physical/built environment; (2) the ecological environment; (3) human health; and (4) socio-economic wellbeing, and is structured at individual, household, settlement, and city/beyond spatial scales. Conclusions: Our planetary health model includes key risk factors and faecal-oral exposure pathways but extends beyond conventional microbiological faecal-oral enteropathogen exposure pathways to comprehensively account for a wider range of variables affecting health in urban informal settlements. It includes broader ecological interconnections and planetary health-related variables at the household, settlement and city levels. It proposes a composite framework of markers to assess water and sanitation challenges and flood risks in urban informal settlements for optimal design and monitoring of interventions.",,"Faecal-oral exposure,Indonesia,Informal settlements,Makassar,Planetary health,RISE,Urban,WASH",10.1016/j.envint.2021.106679,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.106679

The majority of trials evaluated FMT for induction of remission, with follow-up duration varying from 4 to 52 weeks. One RCT in 21 patients, of single-dose FMT versus placebo, following steroid-induced remission, showed a higher rate of steroid-free clinical remission in the FMT group compared to the control group: 87.5% vs 44.4% at week 10 (P = 0.23). Another RCT, two-dose FMT in 31 patients, showed an overall clinical remission rate of 36% at week 8, however, with no difference in clinical or endoscopic endpoints between FMT administered by gastroscopy and colonoscopy. Considering all studies, the clinical response rates in early follow up were higher following multiple FMT than with single FMT. FMT dose did not appear to influence clinical outcomes, nor did whether FMT was fresh or frozen. FMT delivered via upper gastrointestinal route demonstrated higher early efficacy rates of 75 to 100% compared with lower delivery route rates of 30% to 58%, but on follow up beyond 8 weeks, this difference was not maintained. Whether pre-FMT antibiotic administration was beneficial was not able to be determined due to the limited number of patients receiving antibiotics and varying antibiotic regimens. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Preliminary studies suggest that FMT may be an effective therapy in Crohn's disease. However large controlled trials are needed. No serious safety concerns have been identified.",,"Crohn's disease,Fecal microbiota transplantation,Microbiome,Therapeutics",10.1111/jgh.15598,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15598

Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2021,Biomolecules,2021,11,10,,,1-Oct-21,Review,2218-273X (electronic),"The human gut microbiota consists of bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses. It is a dynamic ecosystem shaped by several factors that play an essential role in both healthy and diseased states of humans. A disturbance of the gut microbiota, also termed “dysbiosis,” is associated with increased host susceptibility to a range of diseases. Because of splanchnic ischemia, exposure to anti-biotics, and/or the underlying disease, critically ill patients loose 90% of the commensal organisms in their gut within hours after the insult. This is followed by a rapid overgrowth of potentially path-ogenic and pro-inflammatory bacteria that alter metabolic, immune, and even neurocognitive functions and that turn the gut into the driver of systemic inflammation and multiorgan failure. Indeed, restoring healthy microbiota by means of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in the critically ill is an attractive and plausible concept in intensive care. Nonetheless, available data from controlled studies are limited to probiotics and FMT for severe C.difficile infection or severe inflammatory bowel disease. Case series and observational trials have generated hypotheses that FMT might be feasible and safe in immunocompromised patients, refractory sepsis, or severe antibiotic-associated diarrhea in ICU. There is a burning need to test these hypotheses in randomized controlled trials powered for the determination of patient-centered outcomes.",,"Critically ill,Fecal microbial transplantation,Gut microbiota,Multiorgan failure",10.3390/biom11101459,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biom11101459

One related area of interest is the relationship between dysbiosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as the global prevalence of NAFLD, and its resultant complications, increases.Recent findingsIn this review, we summarize the hypothesized pathophysiology of dysbiosis-mediated progression of NAFLD, including promotion of an inflammatory intestinal environment, increased intestinal permeability, endogenous ethanol production, short-chain fatty acid production, secondary bile acid metabolism, and choline depletion. We also review potential therapeutic interventions of the microbiome to slow or prevent NAFLD progression, including antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplant, and farnesoid × receptor agonism.SummaryMuch of the evidence supporting dysbiosis-mediated NAFLD progression has been gathered in high-quality animal trials.

Lactulose and rifaximin are thought to alter gut flora thereby reducing ammonia production. Recent studies have investigated the benefit of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in preventing HE in patients with liver cirrhosis. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the benefit of FMT versus SOC in preventing HE and various outcomes in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. Methods: A literature search was performed using Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases from inception to June 2021. Studies included in our meta-analysis involved adult patients diagnosed with decompensated liver cirrhosis who received prophylactic FMT versus standard of care (SOC). Analysis was conducted using the Mantel-Haenszel model to assess the rate of HE, severe adverse events (SAE), death, variceal bleeding, and infection risk. The results were pooled together using Reviewer Manager 5.4 software, and heterogeneity was quantified using I2 statistics. Results: Five clinical trials involving 129 patients were included in the final analysis. All studies but one were randomized controlled trials. Our findings suggest that FMT provides a significant benefit in preventing HE in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis (OR 0.12, 95% CI [0.02, 0.58], P=0.009) compared to SOC. The rate of severe adverse events was significantly lower in the FMT group (OR 0.07, P<0.0001). The rates of death (OR 0.33, P=0.05), variceal bleeding (OR 0.51, P=0.30), and infection (OR 1.01, P=0.98) was similar between both groups. Only one study investigated the rate of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, as a result, analysis was not performed for this outcome. Conclusion: Prophylactic use of fecal microbiota transplantation demonstrated a significant benefit in preventing hepatic encephalopathy and serious adverse events in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis as compared to standard of care. There were no differences noted in terms of death rate, variceal bleeding, or the incidence of infection. The major limitation of this systematic review is the scarcity of studies about this topic and the small sample size of the analyzed studies..",,,10.14309/01.ajg.0000778492.86774.24,http://dx.doi.org/10.14309/01.ajg.0000778492.86774.24

In patients with severe perianal disease, the creation of ostomy for fecal diversion (FD) may be necessary. Of those patients, a subgroup will end up with a permanent stoma. The rate of stoma reversal with subsequent intestinal continuity restoration varies in the literature and data in the post biologic era has been controversial. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a metaanalysis study of comparative studies comparing the use of anti tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents versus not and the rate of successful restoration of intestinal continuity and ostomy closure. Methods: A comprehensive search of Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus was conducted from each database's inception to January 16th, 2021. We included comparative studies of anti TNF agents versus nonbiologic therapies in Crohn's disease patients with fecal diversion and looked at the outcome of ostomy reversal and restoration of bowel continuity. Results: A total of seven studies assessed the use of anti TNF agents in post ostomy. Of this, data from five studies with a total of 348 patients were able to be extracted. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that the use of anti TNF agents post fecal diversion was not associated with a statistically significant risk of reducing the need for permanent ostomy (OR of 01.193; 95% CI: 0.618-2.303; I(2)= 22.7%). No publication bias was seen among the included studies as seen in the funnel plot. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis showed no difference in ostomy closure rate among patients with Crohn's disease with ostomy whether anti TNF therapy was used or not.

However, the safety of MB is being questioned since serious adverse events (AEs) such as hemodynamic instability, hemolysis, and serotonin syndrome were reported. The aim of this study is a systematic analysis of the literature to obtain an evidence-based overview of AEs due to oral administration of MB and to determine its safety as a food dye during swallowing assessment. Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Two reviewers independently selected articles describing oral administration of MB as a main diagnostic/therapeutic intervention, dosage, and AEs. Expert opinions, conference papers, sample size < 10, and animal studies were excluded. Level of evidence of the included studies was determined. Results: A total of 2264 unduplicated articles were obtained. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria with 100% agreement between the two reviewers. Among these, twelve studies were randomized controlled trials. In a pooled population of 1902 patients receiving oral MB, three serious AEs were reported related to MB. Non-serious AEs showed a dose-related trend and were usually mild and self-limiting. A meta-analysis could not be performed as studies were methodologically too heterogeneous. Conclusion: Serious AEs due to oral administration of MB are rare (n = 3, 0.16%). MB-related non-serious AEs are mild, self-limiting, and show a dose-related trend.

However, in clinical practice, the data regarding how each etiology contributes to the diarrheal episodes are limited. We identify the causes and factors associated with post-feeding diarrhea. Methods: Using the data of patients enrolled in “Effect of Psyllium Fiber Supplementation on Diarrhea Incidence in Enteral Tube-Fed Patients: A Prospective, Randomized, and Controlled Trial”, the randomized controlled trial showed no difference in diarrheal incidences between fiber-added and fiber-free formulas. Hence, we analyzed the data of all enrolled patients. The causes of diarrhea were classified according to pre-specified definitions. The factors associated with diarrhea were analyzed using logistic regression. Results: Diarrhea was found in 37.3% (n = 31/83). The most common cause was medication associated (61.3%). CDAD and EN-associated diarrhea were found in only 9.7% and 6.5%, respectively. Patients with baseline albumin <3 g/dL and underlying cerebrovascular disease were more likely to develop diarrhea (adjusted odds ratio 5.70, 95% confidence interval 1.79–20.51, and adjusted odds ratio 10.83, 95% confidence interval 2.96–48.57, respectively). Compared with those without diarrhea, the length of hospital stay in CDAD patients was significantly longer (+23.1 days, P = 0.02), a trend of longer hospital stay in patients with diarrhea from other causes was observed (+3.2 days, P = 0.096). Conclusions: Our study found that the most common cause of post-feeding diarrhea is medication associated. Review and cessation of possible drugs should be undertaken before EN modification.

After birth, our intestine is colonized by microbes like Escherichia coli, Clostridium spp., Streptococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides spp., and Bifidobacterium spp. Our intestine is an extremely complex living system that participates in the protection of host through a strong defence against external aggregations. The microbial ecosystem of the intestine includes many native species of Bacteroides and Firmicutes that permanently colonize the gastrointestinal tract. The composition of flora changes over time depending upon diet and medical emergencies which leads to the diseased condition. Probiotics exert their mode of action by altering the local environment of the gut by competing with the pathogens, bacteriocins production, H2O2 production etc. Obesity is one of the major health problems and is considered as the most prevalent form of inappropriate nutrition. Probiotics like Lactobacillus Sp., Bifidobacterium Sp., Streptococcus Sp. are successfully used in the treatment of obesity proved in clinical trials. Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT), also known as a stool transplant, is the process of transplantation of Faecal bacteria from a healthy donor into a recipient's gut to restore normal flora in the recipient.

Objectives: To review the literature about the impact of environmental interventions (non-related to sanitizers) in the clinical impact of MDROs. Methods: Studies were identified through electronic literature search of PubMed, CINAHL, and SCOPUS, by two independent authors. Any type of environmental interventions in surgical centers, ICUs and wards were evaluated. No restrictions regarding patients and microorganisms were applied. Bench studies, MDROs inocula on surfaces, studies based on sanitizers (disinfectants or detergents) or animal studies were excluded. Quality of randomized controlled trials and non-randomized ones were evaluated by the Cochrane Collaboration's tool, and Newcastle-Ottawa scale, respectively. Results: The search strategy identified 1173 studies. Of those, 20 studies were included in systematic review. Only 4 studies were randomized, and those, only 1 (a bundle-based intervention), assessed the impact on clinical outcomes. Bundle of interventions (including educational procedures) were the most frequently non-sanitiser method found (7 studies). Ultraviolet light (UV, 2 studies) and hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV, 4 studies) seemed to be promising methods to improve cleaning processes. Wipe-based methods were assessed in 2 prospective studies, and one of them highlights the potential of spread MDROs in case of not properly used. Other cleaning methods (for instance, testing more cloths, electrolysed water, extra cleaning etc.), were evaluated in 5 studies.

Efficacy outcomes included change from baseline in HbA1c, body weight, and blood pressure. Safety outcomes included cardiovascular endpoints, serious adverse events, discontinuation due to any adverse event, hypoglycaemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, diarrhoea, volume depletion, and genital infections. We performed random effects meta-analyses and calculated mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes, alongside 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: We included 10 trials with 16231 patients. Mean trial duration was 50 weeks, while patient's mean age at baseline was 63.8 years, mean HbA1c was 8.2% and mean systolic blood pressure was 135.6 mmHg. Nine trials compared sotagliflozin with placebo, two with empagliflozin and one with glimepiride.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Data sources We performed a literature search of the electronic databases CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, MEDLINE (Ovid) and Web of Science from database inception to May 2021 as well as hand searching of trial registries and reference lists of related reviews. Study selection Two reviewers identified whether RCTs met the following inclusion criteria: adult population to whom antibiotics were administered; a probiotic intervention; a placebo, alternative dose, alternative probiotic strain or no treatment control; and incidence of AAD as the outcome. Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers independently collected data and assessed risk of bias using preconstructed data extraction forms. We used a random effects model for all analyses. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate species-specific and dose-specific response. Results Forty-two studies (11,305 participants) were included in this review. The pooled analysis suggests that co-administration of probiotics with antibiotics reduces the risk of AAD in adults by 37% (risk ratio (RR)=0.63 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.73), p<0.00001). The overall quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) criteria was found to be moderate. In subgroup analyses, high dose compared with low dose of the same probiotic demonstrated a positive protective effect (RR 0.54 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.76), p<0.01), and only certain species, mainly of the lactobacillus and bifidobacteria genera, were found to be effective.

Recent studies have demonstrated a relationship between gut bacteria and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Approximately 10%–20% of NAFLD patients develop nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and endotoxins produced by Gram-negative bacilli may be involved in NAFLD pathogenesis. NAFLD hyperendotoxicemia has intestinal and hepatic factors. The intestinal factors include impaired intestinal barrier function (leaky gut syndrome) and dysbiosis due to increased abundance of ethanol-producing bacteria, which can change endogenous alcohol concentrations. The hepatic factors include hyperleptinemia, which is associated with an excessive response to endotoxins, leading to intrahepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Clinically, the relationship between gut bacteria and NAFLD has been targeted in some randomized controlled trials of probiotics and other agents, but the results have been inconsistent. A recent randomized, placebo-controlled study explored the utility of lubiprostone, a treatment for constipation, in restoring intestinal barrier function and improving the outcomes of NAFLD patients, marking a new phase in the development of novel therapies targeting the intestinal barrier.

Over time this relationship is thought to shape critical aspects of human function such as metabolism, brain development, immune response, and overall gut health. Recent advances in technology have allowed us to begin understanding this complex relationship and have demonstrated that microbes within the gut ecosystem can be influ-enced by a variety of factors including mode of delivery, diet, and medication exposure, all of which can impact host health in either positive or detrimental ways. Perturbations of gut homeostasis have been implicated in many forms of digestive disease such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, Helicobacter pylori infection, and even in cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. As such, researchers have sought methods to either restore gut homeostasis or prevent dysregulation of the gut community, also known as dysbiosis, through an emerging field known as microbial therapeutics. Examples of existing modalities are reviewed here such as prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbial trans-plantation, and dietary therapy. As these therapies become further substantiated through research and increasingly desired by patients and their families, there is a need for pro-viders caring for children to familiarize themselves with the existing data and indications for use. As we look to the future, machine-learning algorithms and more readily available next-generation sequencing of fecal samples may allow us to harness data from a per-son’s gut microbiota to predict response to a particular intervention and tailor therapeu-tic options with an aim toward precision medicine.

Objectives: We conducted an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews on the effectiveness and risks of interventions to treat overweight and obesity in children and adolescents. Methods: In June 2019, we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for eligible reviews. The primary outcomes were change in adiposity (body mass and body mass index [BMI] z-score) and adverse events. Two reviewers screened studies and one reviewer extracted and another verified data. Two reviewers assessed methodological quality and reached consensus. Data were synthesized narratively. Results: We included seven Cochrane reviews published between 2011 and 2017 containing evidence from 167 randomized controlled trials with 21,050 participants. Lifestyle and behavioural interventions more effectively reduced weight compared with no intervention, usual care, or another behavioural treatment (three reviews, low-to-moderate certainty). Parent-child lifestyle and behavioural interventions more effectively reduced BMI z-score compared with no intervention (one review, low certainty). Decision support tools for healthcare providers more effectively limited increases in BMI z-score compared with usual care (one review, moderate certainty). Pharmacologic treatments combined with behavioural modification more effectively reduced adiposity compared with placebo or usual care (one review, low certainty), but the risk of adverse events was greater than non-pharmacologic therapy. Surgical interventions (e.g., LAP-BAND) combined with behavioural modification more effectively reduced adiposity compared with behavioural modification alone (one review, low certainty). Those who underwent surgery reported a higher number of adverse events compared with those treated with lifestyle modification. Conclusions: There is low-certainty evidence that lifestyle and behavioural interventions, pharmacologic interventions, and surgical interventions are effective in weight management for children with overweight and obesity. Safety data remain lacking across all intervention modalities. Future research should focus on implementation strategies. Further, a focus on overall well-being may be more beneficial than weight management specifically.",,"Child health,Obesity,Overview of Reviews,Overweight,Systematic reviews",10.1093/pch/pxaa085,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxaa085

In addition, short-term (48 h) medication with bismuth subsalicylate is known to be effective against infectious gastroenteritis such as travelers’ diarrhea. Aims: Previous studies have documented the bacteriostatic/bactericidal effects of bismuth subsalicylate against a variety of pathogenic gastrointestinal bacteria. However, meta-analyses of the clinical efficacy of bismuth subsalicylate for both prevention and treatment of travelers’ diarrhea have not yet been published. Methods: A total of 14 clinical studies (from 1970s to 2007) comprised the core data used in this assessment of efficacy of bismuth subsalicylate against infectious (including travelers’) diarrhea. These studies allowed for statistical meta-analyses regarding prevention (three travelers’ diarrhea studies) and treatment of infectious diarrhea (11 studies [five travelers’ diarrhea]). Results: The results show that subjects treated with bismuth subsalicylate for up to 21 days have 3.5 times greater odds of preventing travelers’ diarrhea compared with placebo (95% CI 2.1, 5.9; p < 0.001). In addition, subjects with infectious diarrhea treated with bismuth subsalicylate had 3.7 times greater odds of diarrhea relief (recorded on diaries as subjective symptomatic improvement) compared to those receiving placebo (95% CI 2.1, 6.3; p < 0.001).

The primary objective of this study was to characterize alterations in microRNAs (miRs) following FMT for rCDI. Methods: Sera from 2 prospective multicenter randomized controlled trials were analyzed for miRNA levels with the use of the Nanostring nCounter platform and quantitative reverse-transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, rCDI-FMT and toxin-treated animals and ex vivo human colonoids were used to compare intestinal tissue and circulating miRs. miR inflammatory gene targets in colonic epithelial and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were evaluated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and 3′UTR reporter assays. Colonic epithelial cells were used for mechanistic, cytoskeleton, cell growth, and apoptosis studies. Results: miRNA profiling revealed up-regulation of 64 circulating miRs 4 and 12 weeks after FMT compared with screening, of which the top 6 were validated in the discovery cohort by means of RT-qPCR. In a murine model of relapsing-CDI, RT-qPCR analyses of sera and cecal RNA extracts demonstrated suppression of these miRs, an effect reversed by FMT. In mouse colon and human colonoids, C difficile toxin B (TcdB) mediated the suppressive effects of CDI on miRs. CDI dysregulated DROSHA, an effect reversed by FMT. Correlation analyses, qPCR, and 3′UTR reporter assays revealed that miR-23a, miR-150, miR-26b, and miR-28 target directly the 3′UTRs of IL12B, IL18, FGF21, and TNFRSF9, respectively. miR-23a and miR-150 demonstrated cytoprotective effects against TcdB. Conclusions: These results provide novel and provocative evidence that modulation of the gut microbiome via FMT induces alterations in circulating and intestinal tissue miRs.

Date of Publication: 30 Jun 2021,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2021,2021,6,,,30-Jun-21,Article,1465-1858,"Background: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects between 4% and 12% of people aged 55 to 70 years, and 20% of people over 70 years. A common complaint is intermittent claudication (exercise-induced lower limb pain relieved by rest). These patients have a three- to six-fold increase in cardiovascular mortality. Cilostazol is a drug licensed for the use of improving claudication distance and, if shown to reduce cardiovascular risk, could offer additional clinical benefits. This is an update of the review first published in 2007. Objectives: To determine the effect of cilostazol on initial and absolute claudication distances, mortality and vascular events in patients with stable intermittent claudication. Search methods: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and AMED databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registries, on 9 November 2020. Selection criteria: We considered double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of cilostazol versus placebo, or versus other drugs used to improve claudication distance in patients with stable intermittent claudication. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trials for selection and independently extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. For dichotomous outcomes, we used odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and for continuous outcomes we used mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs. We pooled data using a fixed-effect model, or a random-effects model when heterogeneity was identified. Primary outcomes were initial claudication distance (ICD) and quality of life (QoL). Secondary outcomes were absolute claudication distance (ACD), revascularisation, amputation, adverse events and cardiovascular events. Main results: We included 16 double-blind, RCTs (3972 participants) comparing cilostazol with placebo, of which five studies also compared cilostazol with pentoxifylline. Treatment duration ranged from six to 26 weeks. All participants had intermittent claudication secondary to PAD. Cilostazol dose ranged from 100 mg to 300 mg; pentoxifylline dose ranged from 800 mg to 1200 mg. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded by one level for all studies because publication bias was strongly suspected. Other reasons for downgrading were imprecision, inconsistency and selective reporting. Cilostazol versus placebo. Participants taking cilostazol had a higher ICD compared with those taking placebo (MD 26.49 metres; 95% CI 18.93 to 34.05; 1722 participants; six studies; low-certainty evidence). We reported QoL measures descriptively due to insufficient statistical detail within the studies to combine the results; there was a possible indication in improvement of QoL in the cilostazol treatment groups (low-certainty evidence). Participants taking cilostazol had a higher ACD compared with those taking placebo (39.57 metres; 95% CI 21.80 to 57.33; 2360 participants; eight studies; very-low certainty evidence). The most commonly reported adverse events were headache, diarrhoea, abnormal stools, dizziness, pain and palpitations. Participants taking cilostazol had an increased odds of experiencing headache compared to participants taking placebo (OR 2.83; 95% CI 2.26 to 3.55; 2584 participants; eight studies; moderate-certainty evidence).Very few studies reported on other outcomes so conclusions on revascularisation, amputation, or cardiovascular events could not be made. Cilostazol versus pentoxifylline. There was no difference detected between cilostazol and pentoxifylline for improving walking distance, both in terms of ICD (MD 20.0 metres, 95% CI -2.57 to 42.57; 417 participants; one study; low-certainty evidence); and ACD (MD 13.4 metres, 95% CI -43.50 to 70.36; 866 participants; two studies; very low-certainty evidence). One study reported on QoL; the study authors reported no difference in QoL between the treatment groups (very low-certainty evidence). No study reported on revascularisation, amputation or cardiovascular events. Cilostazol participants had an increased odds of experiencing headache compared with participants taking pentoxifylline at 24 weeks (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.17; 982 participants; two studies; low-certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: Cilostazol has been shown to improve walking distance in people with intermittent claudication. However, participants taking cilostazol had higher odds of experiencing headache. There is insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of cilostazol for serious events such as amputation, revascularisation, and cardiovascular events. Despite the importance of QoL to patients, meta-analysis could not be undertaken because of differences in measures used and reporting. Very limited data indicated no difference between cilostazol and pentoxifylline for improving walking distance and data were too limited for any conclusions on other outcomes.",,,10.1002/14651858.CD003748.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003748.pub5

Hence, this review was undertaken to analyse the available evidence on bioaerosols in OSPs, and their significance in COVID-19 transmission. Methods: A systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv and Lancet preprint databases for studies on bioaerosols in OSPs. Random-effects metanalysis was conducted to determine pooled estimates of key bioaerosol characteristics. Risk of bias was assessed by the RoB-SPEO tool; overall strength of evidence was assessed by the GRADE approach. Results: 17 studies were included in the systematic review, and 6 in different sets of meta-analyses. The pooled estimate of particle density was 390.74 μg/m(3), Total Particle Count, 6.08 × 10(6)/m(3), and Microbial Air Contamination, 8.08 CFU/m(3). Small sized particles (</ = 0.5 μm) were found to be 37 and 1604 times more frequent in the aerosol cloud in comparison to medium and large sized particles respectively. 4 studies reported that haemoglobin could be detected in aerosols, and one study showed that HIV could be transmitted by blood aerosolized by electric saw and burr. The risk of bias for all studies in the review was determined to be high, and the quality of evidence, low. Conclusion: Whereas there is evidence to suggest that OSPs generate large amounts of bioaerosols, their potential to transmit infectious diseases like COVID-19 is questionable. High-quality research, as well as consensus minimum reporting guidelines for bioaerosol research in OSPs is the need of the hour.",,"Aerosol,Aerosol generating procedure (AGP),Coronavirus,COVID19,Guideline,Orthopaedics surgical procedures,Personal protective equipment (PPE),Review,SARS",10.1016/j.jcot.2021.03.016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcot.2021.03.016

Objective: To systematically review the effectiveness, test accuracy, and harms of screening for CRC to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. Data Sources: MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant studies published from January 1, 2015, to December 4, 2019; surveillance through March 26, 2021. Study Selection: English-language studies conducted in asymptomatic populations at general risk of CRC. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers independently appraised the articles and extracted relevant study data from fair- or good-quality studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. Main Outcomes and Measures: Colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, test accuracy in detecting cancers or adenomas, and serious adverse events. Results: The review included 33 studies (n = 10776276) on the effectiveness of screening, 59 (n = 3491045) on the test performance of screening tests, and 131 (n = 26987366) on the harms of screening. In randomized clinical trials (4 trials, n = 458002), intention to screen with 1- or 2-time flexible sigmoidoscopy vs no screening was associated with a decrease in CRC-specific mortality (incidence rate ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.68-0.80]). Annual or biennial guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) vs no screening (5 trials, n = 419966) was associated with a reduction of CRC-specific mortality after 2 to 9 rounds of screening (relative risk at 19.5 years, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.84-0.98]; relative risk at 30 years, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.65-0.93]). In observational studies, receipt of screening colonoscopy (2 studies, n = 436927) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) (1 study, n = 5.4 million) vs no screening was associated with lower risk of CRC incidence or mortality. Nine studies (n = 6497) evaluated the test accuracy of screening computed tomography (CT) colonography, 4 of which also reported the test accuracy of colonoscopy; pooled sensitivity to detect adenomas 6 mm or larger was similar between CT colonography with bowel prep (0.86) and colonoscopy (0.89). In pooled values, commonly evaluated FITs (14 studies, n = 45403) (sensitivity, 0.74; specificity, 0.94) and stool DNA with FIT (4 studies, n = 12424) (sensitivity, 0.93; specificity, 0.85) performed better than high-sensitivity gFOBT (2 studies, n = 3503) (sensitivity, 0.50-0.75; specificity, 0.96-0.98) to detect cancers. Serious harms of screening colonoscopy included perforations (3.1/10000 procedures) and major bleeding (14.6/10000 procedures). CT colonography may have harms resulting from low-dose ionizing radiation. It is unclear if detection of extracolonic findings on CT colonography is a net benefit or harm. Conclusions and Relevance: There are several options to screen for colorectal cancer, each with a different level of evidence demonstrating its ability to reduce cancer mortality, its ability to detect cancer or precursor lesions, and its risk of harms.",,,10.1001/jama.2021.4417,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.4417
The effect of perioperative administration of probiotics on colorectal cancer surgery outcomes,,"Pitsillides L., Pellino G., Tekkis P., Kontovounisios C.",5/20/21,8/9/21,Nutrients (2021) 13:5 Article Number: 1451. Date of Publication: 1 May 2021,Nutrients,2021,13,5,,,1-May-21,Review,2072-6643 (electronic),"1 Abstract: The perioperative care of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients includes antibiotics. Although antibiotics do provide a certain protection against infections, they do not eliminate them completely, and they do carry risks of microbial resistance and disruption of the microbiome. Probiotics can maintain the microbiome’s balance postoperatively by maintaining intestinal mucosal integrity and reducing bacterial translocation (BT). This review aims to assess the role of probiotics in the perioperative management of CRC patients. The outcomes were categorised into: postoperative infectious and non-infectious complications, BT rate analysis, and intestinal permeability assessment. Fifteen randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. There was a trend towards lower rates of postoperative infectious and non-infectious complications with probiotics versus placebo. Probiotics reduced BT, maintained intestinal mucosal permeability, and provided a better balance of beneficial to pathogenic microorganisms. Heterogeneity among RCTs was high. Factors that influence the effect of probiotics include the species used, using a combination vs. single species, the duration of administration, and the location of the bowel resection. Although this review provided evidence for how probiotics possibly operate and reported notable evidence that probiotics can lower rates of infections, heterogeneity was observed. In order to corroborate the findings, future RCTs should keep the aforementioned factors constant.",,"Colonic resection,Colorectal cancer,Colorectal surgery,Perioperative care,Probiotics",10.3390/nu13051451,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu13051451

The infection is most likely secondary to the autograft becoming contaminated during harvest and preparation, introducing bacteria into the joint on insertion. Presoaking ACL grafts in 5 mg/mL vancomycin is a novel method developed to eradicate this bacterial contamination and is supported by compelling Level III evidence from multiple observational trials showing a dramatic reduction in infection rates without any evidence of increased graft failure. As such, it is time for this technique to become a universal recommendation? That said, as observational studies using a historical cohort as a comparator are at risk of various biases, Level I evidence is ultimately required for infection prophylaxis methods to be recognized as a universal recommendation in infection control guidelines. Consequently, future research endeavors on the “vancomycin wrap” should focus on randomized controlled trials, possibly nested within ACL registries.",,,10.1016/j.arthro.2021.02.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2021.02.002

Aim: Microscopic colitis (MC) presents with chronic watery diarrhea, abdominalpain, cramping, bloating, nocturnal defecation, and occasional weight loss. The diagnosisis based on colonic tissue biopsy to reveal specific histological features. Several drugs,including mesalamine, budesonide, and other immunomodulators, are used for treating thedisease process. In this meta-analysis, we compared treatment efficacy and adverse events(AEs) of budesonide and mesalamine therapy in MC. Methods: We searched the CochraneLibrary, Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed, comparing mesalamine or budesonide witha control group in the treatment of MC. Outcomes included clinical remission (three orfewer stools/day), stool characteristics (daily stool weight, daily stool frequency, daily stoolconsistency), and the number of patients with clinical response (<50% in the disease activity).Safety endpoints included: any AE-related discontinuation, including abdominal discomfort,constipation, flatulence, nausea, dizziness, headache, bronchitis, nasopharyngitis, and depression.The meta-analysis was conducted using the generic inverse variance method andperformed a subgroup analysis based on the intervention. Results:Our literature search retrieved 19 randomized clinical trials with a total of 821 patients.We report that after eight weeks of follow-up, budesonide showed significantly higher clinicalremission rates RR=2.29 [2.14, 2.45], than mesalamine RR= 1.7 [1.41, 2.05], p=0.003. Aftereight weeks, no difference in stool weight was seen in the budesonide group (MD=-351.62[-534.25, -168.99]) compared to mesalamine (MD=-104.3 [-372.34, 163.74]), p=0.14.However, the daily stool frequency was significantly less in the budesonide group thanmesalamine (p<0.001). Also, significantly lower endpoint AEs were reported with budesonideas compared to mesalamine (p=0.002). Conclusion: Treatment with budesonide was foundto be superior to mesalamine in microscopic colitis patients in terms of clinical remissionrate (stool frequency), especially after eight weeks of follow up. Budesonide also showed asignificantly fewer AEs. There is a need for randomized, double-blinded clinical trials toprovide direct evidence for our results.

Diarrhea not only affects the overall treatment effectiveness but also reduces patients' quality of life. Severe diarrhea can lead to electrolyte imbalance and even be life-threatening. Although acupuncture has been widely used in clinical practice and its effectiveness for managing functional diarrhea has been recognized, there is no sound evidence of its efficacy in managing CID. Therefore, the aim of the proposed randomized controlled trial is to examine the effectiveness and potential risks of using acupuncture for the management of CID and to describe its protocol herein. Methods: This trial will be conducted in a double-blinded manner and comprise two arms that will be investigated across multiple centers in parallel. The study cohort will comprise 168 outpatients who have CID from six Chinese hospitals. The patients will be randomly and equally divided between an intervention group (electroacupuncture) and a control group (micro-electroacupuncture). In the former, acupuncture will be performed with the conventional method to induce the de qi sensation, and in the latter group, acupuncture will be performed with a sham procedure that does not involve the insertion of needles. The acupoints ST25, SP14, SP6, and ST37 will be applied in the two methods. These procedures will be performed three times a week for four consecutive weeks. The number of days on which CID occurred, the incidence of CID, and fecal characteristics are considered as the primary outcomes, and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy for Patients with Diarrhea subscale score and the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment are considered as secondary outcomes. The patients will be closely observed for complications and fluctuations in vital signs. Discussion: If the findings from the trial demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of using acupuncture to treat CID, they could serve as evidence for the clinical application of acupuncture as a complementary treatment for cancer patients during chemotherapy.",,"Acupuncture,Cancer,Chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (CID),Randomized controlled trial",10.21037/tcr-20-3400,http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/tcr-20-3400

Termed the brain-gut axis, this bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and enteric nervous system relies on immune, endocrine, neural, and metabolic pathways. There is increasing evidence that the gut microbiome is a key part of this system, and dysregulation of the brain-gut-microbiome axis (BGMA) has been implicated in disorders of brain-gut interaction, including irritable bowel syndrome, and in neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorder. Further, alterations in the gut microbiome have been implicated in the pathogenesis of organic gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. The BGMA is an attractive therapeutic target, as using prebiotics, probiotics, or postbiotics to modify the gut microbiome or mimic gut microbial signals could provide novel treatment options to address these debilitating diseases. However, despite significant advancements in our understanding of the BGMA, clinical data is lacking. In this article, we will review current understanding of the comorbidity of gastrointestinal diseases and psychological disorders.

AIM To develop more effective clinical strategies and techniques for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections in burn patients. METHODS Clinical samples with positive bacteria were collected from patients at the burn ward in Beijing Jishuitan Hospital in China between January 2006 and December 2019. The samples were retrospectively analyzed, the distribution of pathogenic bacteria was determined, and the trends and changes in bacterial drug resistance during different period were assessed. Drug resistance in several main pathogenic bacteria from 2006 to 2011 and from 2012 to 2019 was comparatively summarized and analyzed. RESULTS Samples from 17119 patients were collected and analyzed from 2006 to 2019. Surprisingly, a total of 7960 strains of different pathogenic bacteria were isolated at this hospital. Among these bacteria, 87.98% (7003/7960) of the strains were isolated from burn wounds, and only 1.34% (107/7960) were isolated from the blood of patients. In addition, 49.70% (3956/7960) were identified as Gram-positive bacteria, 48.13% (3831/7960) were Gram-negative bacteria, and the remaining 2.17% (173/7960) were classified as fungi or other pathogens. Importantly, Staphylococcus aureus (21.68%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.23%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (9.61%) were the top three pathogens most frequently isolated from patients. CONCLUSION In patients treated at the burn ward in this hospital from 2006 to 2019, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the predominant clinical pathogens responsible for bacterial infections. The circumstantial detection and detailed monitoring of the intensity and growth of different pathogenic bacteria in clinical patients as well as tests of drug sensitivity during burn recovery are particularly important to provide guidelines for the application of antibiotics and other related drugs. Careful collection and correct, standard culture of bacterial specimens are also crucial to improve the efficiency of bacterial infection detection. Effective monitoring and timely clinical treatment in patients may help reduce the possibility and rate of infection as well as alleviate the effects of drug resistance among patients in burn centers.",,"Bacterial species,Burn,Drug resistance,Infection,Pathogen distribution",10.12998/wjcc.v9.i10.2228,http://dx.doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i10.2228

Although antibiotics still represent the standard treatment to manage recurrent UTI (rUTI), D-mannose, an inert monosaccharide that is metabolized and excreted in urine and acts by inhibiting bacterial adhesion to the urothelium, represents a promising nonantibiotic prevention strategy. The aim of this narrative review is to critically analyze clinical studies reporting data concerning the efficacy and safety of D-mannose in the management of rUTIs. Methods: A nonsystematic literature search, using the Pubmed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Central Database of Systematic Reviews databases, was performed for relevant articles published between January 2010 and January 2021. The following Medical Subjects Heading were used: “female/woman”, “urinary tract infection”, and “D-mannose”. Only clinical studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses reporting efficacy or safety data on D-mannose versus placebo or other competitors were selected for the present review. Evidence was limited to human data. The selected studies were organized in two categories according to the presence or not of a competitor to D-mannose. Results: After exclusion of non-pertinent studies/articles, 13 studies were analyzed. In detail, six were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one a randomized cross-over trial, five prospective cohort studies, and one a retrospective analysis. Seven studies compared D-mannose to placebo or others drugs/dietary supplements. Six studies evaluated the efficacy of D-mannose comparing follow-up data with the baseline. D-mannose is well tolerated, with few reported adverse events (diarrhea was reported in about 8% of patients receiving 2 g of D-mannose for at least 6 months). Most of the studies also showed D-mannose can play a role in the prevention or rUTI or urodynamics-associated UTI and can overlap antibiotic treatments in some cases. The possibility to combine D-mannose with polyphenols or Lactobacillus seems another important option for UTI prophylaxis. However, the quality of the collected studies was very low, generating, consequently, a weak grade of recommendations as suggested by international guidelines. Data on D-mannose dose, frequency, and duration of treatment are still lacking. Conclusion: Dmannose alone or in combination with several dietary supplements or Lactobacillus has a potential role in the non antimicrobial prophylaxis or recurrent UTI in women. Despite its frequent prescription in real-life practice, we believe that further well-designed studies are urgently needed to definitively support the role of D-mannose in the management of recurrent UTIs in women.",,"Cystitis,D-mannose,Female,Prevention,Treatment,Urinary tract infections,UTI",10.3390/antibiotics10040373,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10040373

It has a long half-life and activity against liver-stage malaria parasites, so may be useful for chemoprophylaxis. Antimalarial agents are drugs used for the treatment or prophylaxis of malaria. Malaria is caused by four species of Plasmodium, such as Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax. Arakoda contains tafenoquine succinate, an antimalarial agent for oral administration. The molecular formula of tafenoquine succinate is C(24)H(28)F(3)N(3)O(3)∙C(4)H(6)O(4) and its molecular weight is 581.6 as the succinate salt. It is given in prophylaxis of malaria patient aged 18 years older. Tafenoquine is active against pre-erythrocytic (liver) and erythrocytic (asexual) forms as well as gametocytes of Plasmodium species. G6PD test is performed before giving the drug. Analytical studies were on NMR, IR, MS, HPLC, Flourimetry analysis. In vitro studies have shown that tafenoquine presents an average 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.436mcg against blood stages of seven strains of P. falciparum.

Its prevention is vital to improve prognosis of cirrhotic patients. The main objective of this systematic review was to evaluate what is the most efficacious and safest antibiotic prophylactic strategy. Methods: Studies were located by searching PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library until February 2019. Randomized controlled trials evaluating primary or secondary spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with ascites were included. The selection of studies was performed in two stages: screening of titles and abstracts, and assessment of the full papers identified as relevant, considering the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted in a standardized way and synthesized qualitatively. Results: Fourteen studies were included. This systematic review demonstrated that daily norfloxacin is effective as a prophylactic antibiotic for the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis. Once weekly ciprofloxacin was not inferior to once daily norfloxacin, with good tolerance and no induced resistance. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and norfloxacin have similar efficacy for primary and secondary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, however, trimethoprim-sulfa-methoxazole was associated with an increased risk of developing an adverse event. Rifaximin was more effective than norfloxacin in the secondary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, with a significant decrease in adverse events and mortality rate.

Up to 2/3 of Crohn Disease patients have impaired weight at diagnosis, and up to 1/3 have impaired height. Ulcerative colitis usually manifests earlier with less impaired growth, though patients can be affected. Ultimately, growth delay, if not corrected, can reduce final adult height. Weight loss, reduced bone mass, and pubertal delay are also concerns associated with growth delay in newly diagnosed PIBD patients. The mechanisms for growth delay in IBD are multifactorial and include reduced nutrient intake, poor absorption, increased fecal losses, as well as direct effects from inflammation and treatment modalities. Management of growth delay requires optimal disease control. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN), biologic therapy, and corticosteroids are the primary induction strategies used in PIBD, and both EEN and biologics positively impact growth and bone development. Beyond adequate disease control, growth delay and pubertal delay require a multidisciplinary approach, dependent on diligent monitoring and identification, nutritional rehabilitation, and involvement of endocrinology and psychiatry services as needed. Pitfalls that clinicians may encounter when managing growth delay include refeeding syndrome, obesity (even in the setting of malnutrition), and restrictive diets. Although treatment of PIBD has improved substantially in the last several decades with the era of biologic therapies and EEN, there is still much to be learned about growth delay in PIBD in order to improve outcomes.",,"Bone mass,Crohn disease,Height,Puberty,Ulcerative colitis,Weight",10.1007/s10620-020-06759-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10620-020-06759-5

The etiology of IBS is not completely understood, but diet appears to play an important role in its pathophysiology. Asian diets differ considerably from those in Western countries, which might explain differences in the prevalence, sex, and clinical presentation seen between patients with IBS in Asian and Western countries. Dietary regimes such as a low-fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet and the modified National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) diet improve both symptoms and the quality of life in a considerable proportion of IBS patients. It has been speculated that diet is a prebiotic for the intestinal microbiota and favors the growth of certain bacteria. These bacteria ferment the dietary components, and the products of fermentation act upon intestinal stem cells to influence their differentiation into enteroendocrine cells. The resulting low density of enteroendocrine cells accompanied by low levels of certain hormones gives rise to intestinal dysmotility, visceral hypersensitivity, and abnormal secretion. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that changing to a low-FODMAP diet restores the density of GI cells to the levels in healthy subjects. These changes in gut endocrine cells caused by low-FODMAP diet are also accompanied by improvements in symptoms and the quality of life.",,"Cellophane noodles,Chili,Enteroendocrine cells,Fecal microbiota transplantation,Fibers,FODMAP,Intestinal microbiota,NICE-modified diet,Rice",10.1007/s12664-020-01144-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12664-020-01144-6

Phenotypically, frontotemporal dementia can present with a behavioral variant or a language variant called primary progressive aphasia. To date, there are no approved symptomatic or disease-modifying treatments for frontotemporal dementia. Currently used therapies are supported by low-level of evidence (mostly uncontrolled) studies. The off-label use of drugs is also limited by their side-effect profile including an increased risk of confusion, parkinsonian symptoms, and risk of mortality. Emerging disease-modifying treatments currently target the progranulin and the expansion on chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 genes as well as tau deposits.

Recent trials suggest the possible use of prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics can helpovercome gastrointestinal and dermatological symptomsthrough increasing the proportion of faecal bacteria (1)Aim: This review aims to determine the effectiveness ofprebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics when added to formulain alleviating allergy symptoms and increasing faecal bacteria in CMPA among infants and children up to the age of 3.Methods: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, CINAHLand Cochrane Library was conducted using a search strategyinvolving subject heading, keywords and Boolean operators(AND/OR) between January 1999 to November 2019. Aninvestigator, who was not blinded, assessed the eligibility ofthe studies against an inclusion and exclusion criteria, established a priori which included any strain or dose of synbiotic,prebiotic or probiotic taken in any form alongside formulawithin infants and children. The same investigator extractedthe data from a modified extraction form. The Cochranerisk of bias tool and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist was conducted to assess quality and level of confidence of each review. Ethical approval was approved byCoventry University Ethics Committee.Result: From 94 screened titles, eight randomised controltrials involving 623 patients with CMPA met eligibility criteria with a mean age between 2.2 months and 9.5 months.Therefore, the studies did not focus on effects in children.The duration of the intervention ranged from 4 to 26 weeksand no studies reported prebiotics as their sole intervention. Five studies added the intervention to formula eitherto amino acid, casein or whey-based formula. However, theother three studies used liquid drops, a capsule or a freezedried powder to be added to formula. All trials used a control group with the same standard formula alone or witheither a placebo capsule, drops or powder. The primary interest, relief of symptoms, was measured using eczema assessment or through assessor or parent-reported outcomes.These pooled results showed mixed evidence around reliefof diarrhoea in both probiotics and synbiotics but showedno significant improvement in respiratory, dermatologicaland other symptoms reported. For the secondary outcomeof interest, results from five studies showed benefit of probiotics and synbiotics in increasing faecal bifidobacteriaand E. rectale/C. coccoides (ER/CC) strains which is ofimportance as low levels of bifidobacteria colonisation inparticular has been linked to allergy development (2) andlinks between microbiota have found in development ofasthma, inflammatory bowel disease and metabolic disorders (3)Discussion: Five of the eight studies raised concerns overthe risk of bias which limits the validity of these results.Furthermore, one study was stopped early due to adverseevents, there is more likely to show extreme intervention effects. Also, there were differences in the type of interventionutilised (different strains or forms such as liquids and powders) and a difference in symptom which lead to difficultymaking comparisons.Conclusions: Overall, there is low certainty that the use ofprobiotics and synbiotics, when added to formula, can improve symptom relief and increase faecal bacteria in infantswith CMPA due to low sample size and mixed bias from thestudies included. No papers focused on prebiotics so there isno certainty of the effects on alleviating symptoms or changing faecal bacteria.",,,10.1111/jhn.12891,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jhn.12891

Meta-analyses assessing the primary outcomes at the age of 4 months included four studies (814 children) comparing the MFGM-supple-mented formulas and SF, and two trials (549 children) comparing the MFGM-supplemented formulas and breastfeeding. The primary outcomes were non-inferior in all the experimental MFGM formulas compared to SF, or even represented more similar results to breastfed infants. The promising effects, including a lower incidence of acute otitis media and improved cognitive development, can-not be firmly confirmed due to the small amount of existing evidence.

In addition, H(2) plays protective roles mainly through anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, the regulation of autophagy, and preservation of mitochondrial function and the blood-brain barrier. Further, H(2) is easy to use and has neuroprotective effects with no major side-effects, indicating that H(2) administration is a potential therapeutic strategy in clinical settings. Here we summarize the H(2) donors and their pharmacokinetics. Meanwhile, we review the effectiveness and safety of H(2) in the treatment of various nervous system diseases based on preclinical and clinical studies, leading to the conclusion that H(2) can be a simple and effective clinical therapy for CNS diseases such as ischemia-reperfusion brain injury, Parkinson’s disease, and diseases characterized by cognitive dysfunction.

In this network meta-analysis, we aimed to compare all available therapies against multiple recurrent CDI (mrCDI) and rank them by efficacy. Methods: After a systematic search, randomized controlled trials (RCT) with any interventions against mrCDI were included. Data were extracted to the study database using Excel. Risk of bias assessment was performed with the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. The primary outcome was the clinical cure of CDI and the secondary outcome was the recurrence of CDI. A Bayesian method was performed to investigate the efficacy rank order of therapies. We registered our protocol with the Prospero Center for Reviews and Dissemination (registration no. CRD42020160365). Results: Six RCTs with seven interventions were included in the quantitative synthesis. According to the surface under the cumulative ranking curve values, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) after a short course of vancomycin therapy (83%) shows the highest efficacy for clinical cure.

The Japanese Society of Gastroenterology (JSGE) published the first edition of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for IBS in 2015. Much more evidence has accumulated since then, and new pharmacological agents and non-pharmacological methods have been developed. Here, we report the second edition of the JSGE-IBS guidelines comprising 41 questions including 12 background questions on epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnostic criteria, 26 clinical questions on diagnosis and treatment, and 3 questions on future research. For each question, statements with or without recommendations and/or evidence level are given and updated diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms are provided based on new evidence. Algorithms for diagnosis are requisite for patients with chronic abdominal pain or associated symptoms and/or abnormal bowel movement. Colonoscopy is indicated for patients with one or more alarm symptoms/signs, risk factors, and/or abnormal routine examination results. The diagnosis is based on the Rome IV criteria. Step 1 therapy consists of diet therapy, behavioral modification, and gut-targeted pharmacotherapy for 4 weeks. For non-responders, management proceeds to step 2 therapy, which includes a combination of different mechanistic gut-targeted agents and/or psychopharmacological agents and basic psychotherapy for 4 weeks. Step 3 therapy is for non-responders to step 2 and comprises a combination of gut-targeted pharmacotherapy, psychopharmacological treatments, and/or specific psychotherapy.

A plant-derived, highly purified CBD formulation with a known and constant composition has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome, Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex. In the European Union, the drug has been authorized by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, in conjunction with clobazam, and is under regulatory review for the treatment of seizures in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. Objectives: This systematic review aimed to summarize the currently available body of knowledge about the use of this US Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency-approved oral formulation of pharmaceutical-grade CBD in patients with epileptic conditions, especially developmental and epileptic encephalopathies other than Dravet syndrome and Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. Methods: The relevant studies were identified through MEDLINE and the US National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry in October 2020. There were no date limitations or language restrictions. The following types of studies were included: clinical trials, cohorts, case-control, cross-sectional, clinical series, and case reports. Participants had to meet the following criteria: any sex, any ethnicity, any age, diagnosis of epilepsy, receiving plant-derived, highly purified (> 98% w/w) CBD in a sesame oil-based oral solution for the treatment of seizures. Data extracted from selected records included efficacy, tolerability, and safety outcomes. Results: Five hundred and seventy records were identified by database and trial register searching. Fifty-seven studies were retrieved for detailed assessment, of which 42 were eventually included for the review. The participants of the studies included patients of both pediatric and adult age. Across the trials, purified CBD was administered at dosages up to 50 mg/kg/day. In a randomized double-blind controlled trial in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, CBD was associated with a significantly greater percent reduction in seizure frequency than placebo over the treatment period. Open-label studies suggested the effectiveness of CBD in the treatment of children and adults presenting with other epilepsy syndromes than those addressed by regulatory trials, including CDKL5 deficiency disorder and Aicardi, Dup15q, and Doose syndromes, SYNGAP1 encephalopathy, and epilepsy with myoclonic absences. The most common adverse events observed during treatment with CBD included somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and increased serum aminotransferases. Conclusions: The currently available data suggest that response to treatment with a highly purified, plant-derived CBD oil-based solution can be seen in patients across a broad range of epilepsy disorders and etiologies.

Phase 3 trials demonstrated significant improvements in anemia and serum iron parameters in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Common adverse effects were gastrointestinal intolerance. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: FM is an effective and well-tolerated alternative to oral iron salts for patients with IBD or CKD and IDA. Emerging data suggest that FM is noninferior to intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose in patients with IBD and IDA. Prior to selecting FM over IV iron products, consideration should be given to time to normalization of Hb, ease of administration, cost, and tolerability.

Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is associated with reduction in antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) burden in patients without cirrhosis; however, the impact in cirrhosis is unclear. We aimed to study the effect of capsule and enema FMT on ARG abundance in fecal samples, which were collected during two published FMT trials in patients with cirrhosis on rifaximin, lactulose, and proton pump inhibitors. ARGs were identified using metagenomics and mapped against the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database. Changes in ARG abundance were studied within/between groups. The capsule FMT trial involved a one-time FMT or placebo capsule administration with stool collection at baseline and week 4 postintervention. Antibiotics+enema FMT included preprocedure antibiotics followed by FMT enema versus standard-of-care (SOC). Stool was collected at baseline, postantibiotics, and day 7/15 postintervention. Both trials included 20 patients each. There was no safety/infection signal linked to FMT. In the capsule trial, beta-lactamase (OXY/LEN) expression decreased post-FMT versus baseline. Compared to placebo, patients who were post-FMT had lower abundance of vancomycin (VanH), beta-lactamase (ACT), and rifamycin ARGs; the latter was associated with cognitive improvement. No changes were seen within patients treated with placebo. In the antibiotics+enema trial for postantibiotics at day 7 versus baseline, there was an increase in vancomycin and beta-lactamase ARGs, which decreased at day 15. However, quinolone resistance increased at day 15 versus baseline. Between SOC and FMT, day 7 had largely lower ARG (CfxA beta-lactamase, VanW, and VanX) that continued at day 15 (cepA beta-lactamase, VanW). No changes were seen within the SOC group. Conclusion: Despite differences in routes of administration and preintervention antibiotics, we found that ARG abundance is largely reduced after FMT compared to pre-FMT baseline and non-FMT groups in decompensated cirrhosis.",,,10.1002/hep4.1639,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hep4.1639

The objective of this study was to evaluate Fecal Calprotectin (FC) and Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) in individuals infected and non-infected with STHs to identify potential intestinal morbidity markers. Methods: Stool from participants diagnosed positive for Trichuris trichiura and concomitant STH infections from three countries was used to perform FC and FOB point-of-care assays. Simultaneously, identified STH negative participants underwent FC and FOB testing as controls. Potential associations between test results and determinants were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Findings: In total, 1034 T. trichiura infected cases (mostly light infections) and 157 STH negative controls were tested for FC and FOB. Among all participants tested, 18·5% had ≥ 50 µg/g FC concentration, while 14 (1·2%) were positive for FOB. No statistically significant association was found between T. trichiura infection or Ascaris lumbricoides co-infection and FC concentration, while an inverse association (odds ratio (OR): 0·45, 95% credible intervals (CrI): 0·26, 0·75) was found between hookworm co-infection and FC concentration. In Lao PDR, the proportion of participants in the ≥ 50 µg/g FC category was significantly higher in the oldest age category compared to the 5–11 years group (OR: 3·31, 95% CrI: 1·62, 7·24). Too few participants were found positive for FOB to derive any conclusions. Interpretation: Studies are needed to better understand the relationship between intestinal morbidity and STH infections. Suitable, standardized, low-cost markers of STH attributable morbidity to better monitor the impact of STH control interventions are necessary.

We conducted a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial in a high-risk, highly mobile fishing community (HIV prevalence: approximately 38%) in Rakai, Uganda, to assess the impact of a community health worker-delivered, theory-based (situated Information, Motivation, and Behavior Skills), motivational interviewing-informed, and mobile phone application-supported counseling strategy called “Health Scouts” to promote engagement in HIV treatment and prevention services. Methods and findings The study community was divided into 40 contiguous, randomly allocated clusters (20 intervention clusters, n = 1,054 participants at baseline; 20 control clusters, n = 1,094 participants at baseline). From September 2015 to December 2018, the Health Scouts were deployed in intervention clusters. Community-wide, cross-sectional surveys of consenting 15 to 49-year-old residents were conducted at approximately 15 months (mid-study) and at approximately 39 months (end-study) assessing the primary programmatic outcomes of self-reported linkage to HIV care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, and male circumcision, and the primary biologic outcome of HIV viral suppression (<400 copies/mL). Secondary outcomes included HIV testing coverage, HIV incidence, and consistent condom use. The primary intent-to-treat analysis used log-linear binomial regression with generalized estimating equation to estimate prevalence risk ratios (PRR) in the intervention versus control arm. A total of 2,533 (45% female, mean age: 31 years) and 1,903 (46% female; mean age 32 years) residents completed the mid-study and end-study surveys, respectively. At mid-study, there were no differences in outcomes between arms. At end-study, self-reported receipt of the Health Scouts intervention was 38% in the intervention arm and 23% in the control arm, suggesting moderate intervention uptake in the intervention arm and substantial contamination in the control arm. At end-study, intention-to-treat analysis found higher HIV care coverage (PRR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.10, p = 0.011) and ART coverage (PRR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.10, p = 0.028) among HIV–positive participants in the intervention compared with the control arm. Male circumcision coverage among all men (PRR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.96 to 1.14, p = 0.31) and HIV viral suppression among HIV–positive participants (PRR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.12, p = 0.20) were higher in the intervention arm, but differences were not statistically significant. No differences were seen in secondary outcomes. Study limitations include reliance on self-report for programmatic outcomes and substantial contamination which may have diluted estimates of effect. Conclusions A novel community health worker intervention improved HIV care and ART coverage in an HIV hyperendemic setting but did not clearly improve male circumcision coverage or HIV viral suppression. This community-based, implementation strategy may be a useful component in some settings for HIV epidemic control.",,,10.1371/journal.pmed.1003475,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003475
Rescuing the last-line polymyxins: Achievements and challenges,,"Nang S.C., Azad M.A.K., Velkov T., Tony Zhou Q., Li J.",4/2/21,9/10/21,Pharmacological Reviews (2021) 73:2 (679-728).

Polymyxins have been revived as a last-line therapeutic option for the treatment of infections caused by multidrugresistant Gram negative bacteria, in particular Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacterales. Polymyxins were first discovered in the late 1940s but were abandoned soon after their approval in the late 1950s as a result of toxicities (e.g., nephrotoxicity) and the availability of “safer” antibiotics approved at that time. Therefore, knowledge on polymyxins had been scarce until recently, when enormous efforts have been made by several research teams around the world to elucidate the chemical, microbiological, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, and toxicological properties of polymyxins. One of the major achievements is the development of the first scientifically based dosage regimens for colistin that are crucial to ensure its safe and effective use in patients. Although the guide-line has not been developed for polymyxin B, a large clinical trial is currently being conducted to optimize its clinical use. Importantly, several novel, safer polymyxin-like lipopeptides are developed to overcome the nephrotoxicity, poor efficacy against pulmonary infections, and narrow therapeutic windows of the currently used polymyxin B and colistin. This review discusses the latest achievements on polymyxins and highlights the major challenges ahead in optimizing their clinical use and discovering new-generation polymyxins. To save lives from the deadly infections caused by Gram negative “superbugs,” every effort must be made to improve the clinical utility of the last-line polymyxins. Significance Statement——Antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to global health. The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections has been highlighted by leading global health organizations and authorities. Polymyxins are a last-line defense against difficult-to-treat MDR Gram negative pathogens. Unfortunately, the pharmacological information onpolymyxinswas very limiteduntil recently. This review provides a comprehensive overview on the major achievements and challenges in polymyxin pharmacology and clinical use and how the recent findings have been employed to improve clinical practice worldwide.",,,10.1124/pharmrev.120.000020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1124/pharmrev.120.000020

Prevalence of DKD is raising continuously with disparate growth in low to middle-income countries and under-recognized as a global burden of disease. DKD imposes an enormous humanistic, economic, and societal burden. DKD in the initial stage is often undiagnosed until the manifestations of serious complications. The major hurdle in the early diagnosis is limited knowledge, unroutine screening. Timely diagnosis and appropriate interventions are the best approaches to deal with this catastrophic condition. Early diagnosis can have lifetime benefits by controlling the progression of the disease, increasing life expectancy, decreasing the humanistic and economic burden.

Methods The review was conducted to get eligible published studies from 1(st) January 2016 to 25(th) March 2020 based on PRISMA protocol. A combination of related words from the Medical Subject Heading Terms (MeSH), with (AND, OR) were used to search for published studies reporting the prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Sciences, Google Scholar, and Iranian databases. Then data from the studies were extracted and reported. Results Our study showed that different water sources of hospitals were contaminated with NTMs. The prevalence of RGM isolates in hospital water samples varied between 42.2%–67.5%, and the prevalence of SGM varied between 32.5%–57.7%, respectively. M. lentiflavum (84.7%), M. avium complex (2.8%–56.4%) and M. gordonae (2.8%–56.2%) were the most prevalent NTM species amongst SGM, whereas M. fortuitum (2.9%–44.2%), M. chelonae (8%–36.8%), M. mucogenicum (8%–25.6%) were the most leading NTM isolates among RGM.

However, several studies documented significant toxic effects induced by preservatives, especially on the ocular surface. Consequently, most of the ophthalmic medications became progressively available in preservative-free (PF) formulations. Areas covered: We analyzed pre-clinical and clinical studies on PF eyedrops with particular attention to common chronic diseases such as dry eye and glaucoma. We discussed about the pros and cons of using PF eyedrops, in terms of efficacy, safety, and social-economic aspects. Expert opinion: There are still unresolved issues that make hard for PF medications to definitively conquer the drug market. Despite robust pre-clinical evidences of less toxicity, the low number of randomized clinical trials does not permit to state that PF eyedrops have, in clinical practice, a similar efficacy or a higher safety compared to preserved forms.

The role of faecal microbiota transplantation: looking beyond Clostridioides difficile infection,,"D. Goldenberg S., Merrick B.",2/2/21,2/15/21,Therapeutic Advances in Infectious Disease (2021) 8. Date of Publication: 2021,Therapeutic Advances in Infectious Disease,2021,8,,,,2021,Review,"2049-937X (electronic),2049-9361","Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the transfer of screened and minimally processed faecal material from a ‘healthy’ donor to ‘diseased’ recipient. It has an established role, and is recommended as a therapeutic strategy, in the management of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Recognition that gut dysbiosis is associated with, and may contribute to, numerous disease states has led to interest in exploiting FMT to ‘correct’ this microbial imbalance. Conditions for which it is proposed to be beneficial include inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, liver disease and hepatic encephalopathy, neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety, systemic inflammatory states like sepsis, and even coronavirus disease 2019. To understand what role, if any, FMT may play in the management of these conditions, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of the therapy. Regardless, there are several barriers to its more widespread adoption, which include incompletely understood mechanism of action (especially outside of CDI), inability to standardise treatment, disagreement on its active ingredients and how it should be regulated, and lack of long-term outcome and safety data. Whilst the transfer of faecal material from one individual to another to treat ailments or improve health has a history dating back thousands of years, there are fewer than 10 randomised controlled trials supporting its use. Moving forward, it will be imperative to gather as much data from FMT donors and recipients over as long a timeframe as possible, and for trials to be conducted with rigorous methodology, including appropriate control groups, in order to best understand the utility of FMT for indications beyond CDI. This review discusses the history of FMT, its appreciable mechanisms of action with reference to CDI, indications for FMT with an emerging evidence base above and beyond CDI, and future perspectives on the field.",,"clostridioides difficile infection (CDI),dysbiosis,faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT),inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),liver disease",10.1177/2049936120981526,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2049936120981526

We undertook a systematic review to characterize the gut microbiome in pancreatitis patients. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for studies on microbiota in pancreatitis published from January 1, 2000 to June 5, 2020. Animal studies, reviews, case reports, and non-English articles were excluded. A frequency analysis was performed for outcomes reported in ≥2 studies and studies were analyzed for risk of bias and quality of evidence. Results: 22 papers met inclusion criteria; 15 included AP, 7 included CP. No studies were appropriately designed to assess whether alterations in the gut microbiome exacerbate pancreatitis or develop as a result of pancreatitis. We did identify several patterns of microbiome changes that are associated with pancreatitis. The gut microbiome demonstrated decreased alpha diversity in 3/3 A P studies and 3/3 C P studies. Beta diversity analysis revealed differences in bacterial community composition in the gut microbiome in 2/2 A P studies and 3/3 C P studies. Functionally, gut microbiome changes were associated with infectious pathways in AP and CP. Several studies suffered from high risk of bias and inadequate quality.

Excessive and prolonged alcohol use leads to ALD, which ranges from early forms such as alcoholic fatty liver (AFL) and alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), through progressive fibrosis to cirrhosis and the development of hepatocellular cancer (HCC). In addition, patients with underlying ALD and continuous alcohol use can develop alcoholic hepatitis (AH), which presents a rapid progression of liver failure and has a high short-term mortality. Genetic, environmental and epigenetic factors influence the progression of ALD to more severe forms. The pathogenesis of ALD is complex and involves multiple pathways. Recent translational studies have demonstrated a key role of the gut-liver axis and innate immunity in hepatocellular damage and fibrosis. In severe forms of AH, hepatocellular de-differentiation and systemic inflammation contribute to liver failure and multiorgan failure. Alcohol abstinence is the cornerstone of therapy for ALD and the prevention of its complications, but the efficacy and accessibility of psycho-familial-social interventions is still poor and effective public health policies to limit problematic alcohol use need to be implemented. Prednisolone is the only current option for AH, with a transient beneficial effect over placebo. For patients with decompensated ALD-cirrhosis and/or development of HCC, liver transplantation (LT) may be required. In recent years, early LT is being increasingly offered to carefully selected AH patients, with excellent long-term survival.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on postoperative outcomes of a preoperative screening and decolonization strategy of nasal carriers for Staphylococcus aureus prior to lung cancer surgery. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study comparing 2 cohorts of patients undergoing major lung resection: a control group of patients from the placebo arm of the randomized Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Chlorhexidine Mouthwashes operated on between July 2012 and April 2015 without any nasopharyngeal screening (N = 224); an experimental group, with preoperative screening for S. aureus of nasal carriers and selective 5-day decolonization in positive carriers using mupirocin ointment between January 2017 and December 2017 (N = 310). The 2 groups were matched according to a propensity score analysis with 1:1 matching. The primary outcome was the rate of postoperative HAIs, and the secondary outcome was the need for postoperative mechanical ventilation after surgery. RESULTS: After matching, 2 similar groups of 108 patients each were obtained. In the experimental group, 26 patients had positive results for nasal carriage, and a significant decrease was observed in the rate of overall postoperative HAIs [control n = 19, 17.6%; experimental group n = 9, 8.3%; P = 0.043; relative risk 0.47 (0.22-1)] and in the rate of postoperative mechanical ventilation [control n = 12, 11.1%; experimental group n = 4, 3.7%; P = 0.038; relative risk 0.33 (0.11-1)]. After logistic regression and multivariable analysis, screening of S. aureus nasal carriers reduced the rate of HAIs [odds ratio (OR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11-0.76; P = 0.01] and reduced the risk of the need for postoperative mechanical ventilation (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05-0.74; P = 0.02). There was no significant statistical difference between the 2 groups regarding the rate of postoperative S. aureus-associated infection (control group n = 6, 5.6%; experimental group n = 2, 1.9%; P = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: Identification of nasal carriers of S. aureus and selective decontamination using mupirocin appeared to have a beneficial effect on postoperative infectious events after lung resection surgery.",,"Lung cancer surgery,Mupirocin,Pneumonia,Postoperative complications,Respiratory insufficiency",10.1093/ICVTS/IVZ305,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ICVTS/IVZ305

Patients with chronic liver disease are predisposed to HE due to metabolic failure and portosystemic shunting of toxins, of which ammonia is believed to be the main toxic chemical. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may reduce ammonia synthesis by altering the gut microbiota composition to a taxon low in urease, diminish uptake of ammonia by reestablishing the integrity of the intestinal barrier and increase ammonia clearance by improving liver function. In this systematic review, we summarize the insights of the current literature examining FMT as a treatment for HE. PubMed and EMBASE were searched on 08 February 2021 using the MeSH terms ‘fecal microbiota transplantation & hepatic encephalopathy’ and the abbreviations ‘FMT & HE’. Eight studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria, comprising two randomized clinical trials, three case reports and three rodent studies. Thirty-nine patients with HE were treated with FMT. Thirty-nine rodents received FMT in laboratory tests. FMT improved neurocognitive test results in four human studies and two rodent studies. Microbiota originating from donors was found in human recipients one year post-FMT. Readmission of patients was lower after treatment with FMT compared to standard of care. FMT may improve neurocognitive function and reduce serious adverse events in patients with HE, but the studies conducted so far have been small and their long-term follow-up is limited. Large-scale, randomized and controlled trials are needed to validate and help standardize the clinical application of FMT in cases of HE.",,"cirrhosis,Fecal microbiota transplantation,FMT,HE,hepatic encephalopathy,hyperammonemia",10.1080/00365521.2021.1899277,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00365521.2021.1899277

Goals of therapy consisting of symptom control and steroid sparing have shifted to control of disease activity with endoscopic remission being an important endpoint. Unfortunately, this requires ileocolonoscopy, an invasive procedure. Biomarkers [C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FCP)] have emerged as surrogates for endoscopic remission and disease activity, but also have limitations. Despite this evolution, we must not lose sight that CD involves transmural inflammation, not fully appreciated with ileocolonoscopy. Therefore, transmural assessment of disease activity by cross-sectional imaging, in particular with magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) and intestinal ultrasonography (IUS), is vital to fully understand disease control. Bowel-wall thickness (BWT) is the cornerstone in assessment of transmural inflammation and BWT normalization, with or without bloodflow normalization, the key element demonstrating resolution of transmural inflammation, namely transmural healing (TH) or transmural remission (TR). In small studies, achievement of TR has been associated with improved long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced hospitalization, surgery, escalation of treatment, and a decrease in clinical relapse over endoscopic remission alone. This review will focus on the existing literature investigating the concept of TR or residual transmural disease and its relation to other existing treatment targets. Current data suggest that TR may be the next logical step in the evolution of treatment targets.",,"Crohn’s disease,cross-sectional imaging,inflammatory bowel disease,transmural healing",10.1177/17562848211006672,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/17562848211006672

Alternative and complementary strategies to classical “Fleming antibiotics” comprise microbiota-based treatments such as fecal microbiota transfer and administration of probiotics, live-biotherapeutics, prebiotics, and postbiotics. Other promising interventions, whose efficacy may also be influenced by the human microbiota, are phages and vaccines.

The rate of IE after TAVI is similar to that after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), but mortality and prevalence of Enterococcus spp. as causing pathogens are significantly higher. Guidelines on infection prevention measures before TAVI procedures are currently lacking. We performed a structured review of the available data to provide interim recommendations based on guidelines to prevent infections issued by the World Health Organization as well as guidelines by professional societies from Europe and the USA. Such interim recommendations based on expert opinions are probably justified until large randomised trials provide strong evidence for infection control in TAVI, because IE after TAVI is often related to the TAVI procedure itself and the associated mortality rate is high. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be adapted from an intravenous cephalosporin to, e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, to cover enterococci. In addition, infection control should follow operating room standards as far as is reasonable, even if the evidence for this recommendation is very low.

Additionally, the use of a helicase-primase (HP) inhibitor (HPI), amenamevir, is changing the treatment of herpes zoster (HZ). Area covered: VZV infection is prevented by vaccines and is treated with antiviral agents. Acyclovir and penciclovir are phosphorylated by viral thymidine kinase and work as chain terminators. Improvements in the management of immunocompromised patients have reduced severe and prolonged immunosuppression and chronic VZV infection with acyclovir-resistant mutants has become rarer. The HP is involved in the initial step of DNA synthesis and amenamevir has novel mechanisms of action, efficacy to acyclovir-resistant mutants, and pharmacokinetic characteristics. The literature search for PUBMED was conducted on 10 April 2020 and updated on 4 November 2020. Expert opinion: Amenamevir has been used to treat HZ in Japan. Although the number of patients with VZV infection will decrease owing to the use of vaccines, the addition of HPI will improve treatment and treatment options for resistant viruses.

This article aims to provide a narrative updated review on the evaluation and management of viral gastroenteritis in children. Methods: A PubMed search was performed with Clinical Queries using the key term 'viral gastroenteritis'. The search strategy included clinical trials, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, observational studies and reviews. The search was restricted to the English literature and the paediatric population. Results: Acute viral gastroenteritis is usually self-limiting. However, it can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance if not properly treated. Adequate fluids containing physiological concentrations of glucose and electrolytes should be provided to compensate for gastrointestinal losses and cover maintenance needs. Oral rehydration therapy is as effective as intravenous (IV) fluid therapy for rehydration for children with mild-to-moderate dehydration. Measurements of serum electrolytes, creatinine and glucose are usually not necessary and should only be considered in a subset of children with severe dehydration who require hospitalization and IV therapy. Judicious use of ondansetron can increase the success rate of oral rehydration therapy and minimize the need for IV therapy and hospitalization. Conclusion: Acute viral gastroenteritis is associated with substantial morbidity in developed countries and significant mortality in developing countries. Physicians should educate caregivers on proper personal hygiene and handwashing to prevent faecal to oral transmission of the pathogen as well as the importance of rotavirus vaccine in the prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis. Several norovirus vaccines are currently undergoing clinical trials with promising results.

The pooled relative risks (RRs) and weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random-effects model. Results: Twelve trials recruited a total of 868 IMN patients were identified and contained in final meta-analysis.

Cancer-free controls were matched 1:1 by age (±5 years), race, gender, and BMI (±5 kg/m(2)). All participants provided faecal samples; isolated bacterial DNA were PCR amplified at the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and analysed using the QIIME pipeline. Tests compared cases versus controls, then separately by gender. Microbial alpha-diversity and beta-diversity were assessed, and relative abundance of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU’s) were compared at the genus level, with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. 22 overweight and obese cancer patients were matched with 22 cancer-free controls, with an average BMI of 30.5±4.3 kg/m(2), age 54.4±5.3 years, and 54.5% were black. Fourteen matches were made between breast cancer cases and healthy female controls, and 8 matches were made with prostate cancer cases and healthy male controls. Comparison of all cases and controls revealed no differences in alpha diversity, though prostate cancer patients had higher Chao1 (P=0.006) and Observed Species (P=0.036) than cancer-free males.

Encapsulated administration may be equivalent in efficacy to delivery through other routes. Methods: A systematic review was undertaken of studies using encapsulated FMT up to 26 October 2020. Data on indication, clinical outcomes, safety, treatment protocol and capsule preparation were collected and reported. Pooled rates of clinical efficacy in rCDI were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. The impact of single variables on clinical efficacy was evaluated using univariate meta-regression. Results: A total of 35 studies reporting the treatment of 960 patients with encapsulated FMT for eight different indications met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (n = 18, 51%) and patients (n = 755, 79%) were from studies on rCDI. Cure rates after single and multiple courses of treatments with encapsulated FMT in rCDI were 85% (95% CI: 82%-88%) and 93% (95% CI: 88%-96%) respectively. The treatment outcome was not significantly affected by dose, number of delivered capsules, anaerobic/aerobic processing, single/multi-donor treatment, lyophilisation, or any other single factor in the production or delivery of encapsulated FMT. Promising but non-comparable results from the treatment of ulcerative colitis and multidrug-resistant organisms were reported. Conclusions: Encapsulated FMT is an effective and safe treatment of rCDI, with cure rates comparable to FMT delivered through other routes. The treatment is effective despite variations in donor screening, preparation and treatment protocol. For other indications, the role of FMT capsules is still not sufficiently examined, although some studies show promising results. Plain Language Summary: Transfer of faecal material through capsules in the treatment of various diseases. Evidence for clinical efficacy The bacteria and other microorganisms of the gut is different in patient with various diseases in comparison with healthy subjects. Therefore, ways to change the microorganisms of the gut in a beneficial direction has been the subject of various research projects within recent years. Faecal microbiota transplantation often referred as FMT is a method of transferring microorganisms from healthy donors to patients with various diseases and is seen as one way to change the microbial community of the gut in a beneficial direction. Faecal microbiota transplantation can be performed in different ways such as through endoscopy, enemas or capsules. The transfer through capsules is preferred by the patients and has advantages since it can be administered long-term and can be delivered to the patients in their home. In this paper, we evaluated all accessible research reporting treatment with encapsulated faecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of various diseases. We report the following major findings: -Treatment with capsules is safe when guidelines for screening donors and testing faecal material is followed. -The treatment is highly effective in the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection, a disease with high mortality often caused by repeated antibiotic treatments. The treatment was effective in 596 of 723 patients following one course of capsule treatment. -Faecal microbiota transplantation delivered through capsules is as effective as treatment delivered through other routes in the treatment of C. difficile infection. -The treatment is effective in the treatment of C. difficile infection across studies and countries, despite great differences in the ways the capsules were prepared and delivered. -Increasing the amount of faecal material used in the production did not affect the efficacy of the treatment. -There are promising results in the treatment of other diseases such as liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease and the treatment of multi-drug resistant bacteria.",,"capsules,Clostridioides difficile,encapsulated,faecal microbiota transplantation,lyophilisation,meta-analysis,microbiome,systematic review,ulcerative colitis",10.1177/17562848211041004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/17562848211041004

Behcet's disease (BD) is an autoimmune disease of systemic vasculitis with an unclear pathogenesis. Although western medicines remain the mainstay interventions, effectiveness and safety are significant challenges. Complementary and alternative medicine, including herbal medicine, are gaining more attention. Chinese medicine decoctions, which have been used for centuries, are the most common form of traditional therapies. Objective. The purpose of the review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicine decoctions in the treatment of BD. Methods. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for BD treatment with Chinese medicine decoctions were searched in six electronic databases until March 2021. Primary outcomes were total effective rate, recovery rate, and recurrence rate. Secondary outcomes were clinical feature scores (oral ulcers, eye lesions, genital ulcers, skin lesions, arthropathies, fever, and pathergy reactions) and laboratory index levels (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and immunoglobulin A). The risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Handbook, and a meta-analysis was performed with RevMan 5.4.1. Results. Sixteen RCTs with 924 patients were included in the review. The meta-analysis indicated that Chinese medicine decoctions were effective for BD when compared with control groups for all the primary outcomes and 7/10 of the secondary outcomes. Adverse events were reported in 11 of the 16 RCTs, with the Chinese medicine decoctions possibly having fewer adverse events than western drugs. This review included a range of classical prescriptions. An additional meta-analysis of modified Gancao Xiexin Decoction for BD treatment was conducted.

The clinical spectrum of CDI is broad, ranging from asymptomatic to deadly fulminant colitis. When associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), CDI is more prevalent and more severe than in the general population, due to specific risk factors such as impaired immune system, intestinal dysmotility, high antibiotic use leading to disturbed microbiota, frequent hospitalization, and PPI use. We performed a systematic review on the issue of prevention and treatment of CDI in the CKD population, analysing the suitable randomized controlled cohort studies published between 2000 and 2021. The results show that the most important aspect of prevention is isolation and disinfection with chlorine-based solution and hydrogen peroxide vapour to stop the spread of bacteria. In terms of prevention, using Lactobacillus plantarum (LP299v) proved to be more efficient than disinfection measures in transplant patients, leading to higher cure rates and less recurrent episodes of CDI. Treatment with oral fidaxomycin is more effective than with oral vancomycin for the initial episode of CDI in CKD patients. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is more effective than vancomycin in recurrent CDI in CKD patients. More large-sample RCTs are necessary to conclude on the best treatment and prevention strategy of CDI in CKD patients.",,,10.1155/2021/5466656,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/5466656

But during the last few years, a downward trend has been observed globally, except in some European countries and Asia. Until recently, C. difficile was the primary cause of nosocomial infection following antibiotic exposure, presenting a high rate of mortality and morbidity. However, the emergence and spread of a hypervirulent strain (BI/NAP1/027) and an increase in the incidence of community-acquired C. difficile infection (CDI), especially in populations not previously considered at high risk, have contributed to alterations in the infection epidemiology. After initial treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, CDI recurrence is the cause of substantial morbidity, indicating that alternative strategies to the usual therapeutics are urgently needed. Several studies have investigated probiotics to assess their preventative and/or prophylactic effects on CDI, but their use is still controversial.

Shen Ling Bai Zhu San (SLBZS) is a botanical formulation used in traditional Chinese medicine to manage diarrhea. This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the available evidence of anti-diarrheal efficacy of SLBZS. Methods: Both English and Chinese language databases were searched through April 20, 2020 for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Fourteen RCTs involving 1,158 participants were included. Reported outcomes included stool frequency, stool consistency, patient-reported satisfaction of chronic diarrhea treatment, and adverse events (AEs). Controls used were prescription drugs and in one study placebo SLBZS. Results: Quality of the studies ranged from low to high risk of bias. One small study reported SLBZ's effects on objective outcomes (no significant reduction in stool frequency but a significant improvement in stool consistency in week 12, when compared to placebo). Meta-analysis showed that SLBZS with or without conventionalmedicine was associated with higher patient-reported satisfaction compared to conventional medicine (RR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.40 to 3.29; p = 0.0004; I2 =0%; and RR, 2.34; 95%CI, 1.84 to 2.97; p < 0.00001, I2 = 0). The risk of AEs was not greater with SLBZS (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.84; p = 0.009; I2 =0%). Conclusions: This systematic review found that treatment with SLBZS significantly improved patient-reported satisfaction.

In 2016, WHO stated the Southeast Asia region as the fourth-highest incidence rate and prevalence of gonorrhea. One of the current problems with gonorrhea is related to its emerging resistance to first-line drugs such as cephalosporins, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones. This resistance has an impact on the difficulty of finding effective antibiotics to eradicate the infection, thus risking financial loss and infertility in sexually active age patients. This literature review will discuss solithromycin, the first fluoroketolide in phase III clinical trial, and show its potential as a new antibiotic against infection with resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Literatures are searched using Pubmed and Google Scholar search engines with keywords: antibiotics, CEM-101, clinical trial, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, new treatment, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, resistance, safety, and solithromycin. This semisynthetic antibiotic is supported by a different chemical structure from previous macrolides; improving solithromycin becomes more stable and able to bind easier with bacterial ribosomes. Pharmacologically, solithromycin provides an advantage in its high bioavailability, easy oral administration route, wide distribution, metabolism mainly in the liver, but not required dosage adjustments due to hepatic impairment, and a single dosage preparation that can increase patient compliance in healing gonorrhea infections. Also, its lower MIC50 than previous antibiotics makes it well-tolerated, therefore making this antibiotic as a potential recommendation for the management of multi-drug resistant gonorrhea in the future. Solithromycin is not inferior to the standard therapy (ceftriaxone and azithromycin), with 80% vs. 84% gonorrhea eradication rates. Per the anatomic site, the eradication rate is 92% in genital, 94% in the pharynx, and 83% in the rectum. However, special attention needs to be paid to the side effects of the gastrointestinal tract of solithromycin, as observed in phase III clinical trials at a dose of 1000 mg in the form of diarrhea (24%) and nausea (21%).",,"Antibiotic,CEM-101,Gonorrhea,Resistance,Solithromycin",10.22146/ijp.1123,http://dx.doi.org/10.22146/ijp.1123

Colonic diverticulosis (the presence of diverticula in the colon; referred to as diverticulosis) remains asymptomatic in most individuals but ~25% of individuals will develop symptomatic diverticulosis, termed colonic diverticular disease (also known as diverticular disease). Diverticular disease can range in severity from symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) to symptomatic disease with complications such as acute diverticulitis or diverticular haemorrhage. Since the early 2000s, a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of diverticulosis and diverticular disease, which encompasses genetic alterations, chronic low-grade inflammation and gut dysbiosis, has led to improvements in diagnosis and management. Diagnosis of diverticular disease relies on imaging approaches, such as ultrasonography, CT and MRI, as biomarkers alone are insufficient to establish a diagnosis despite their role in determining disease severity and progression as well as in differential diagnosis. Treatments for diverticular disease include dietary fibre, pharmacological treatments such as antibiotics (rifaximin), anti-inflammatory drugs (mesalazine) and probiotics, alone or in combination, and eventually surgery.

Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2020,Dental Cadmos,2020,88,10,656,669,1-Dec-20,Article,0011-8524,"BACKGROUND Many dental procedures produce aerosols that harbour various pathogenic micro-organisms and may pose a risk for the spread of infections between dentist and patient. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to greater concern about this risk. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of methods used during dental treatment procedures to minimize aerosol production and reduce or neutralize contamination in aerosols. SEARCH METHODS The following databases were searched on 17 September 2020: Cochrane Oral Health’s Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library, 2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946); Embase Ovid (from 1980); the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease; the US National Insti tutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov); the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register. SELECTION CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on aero sol-generating procedures (AGPs) performed by dental healthcare providers that evaluated methods to reduce contaminated aerosols in dental clinics (excluding pre-procedural mouthrinses). The primary outcomes were incidence of infection in dental staff or patients, and reduction in volume and level of contaminated aerosols in the operative environment. The secondary outcomes were cost, accessibility and feasibility. MAIN RESULTS We included 16 studies with 425 participants aged 5 to 69 years (8 studies at high risk of bias). No studies measured infection. All studies measured bacterial contamination using the surrogate outcome of colony-forming units (CFU). The results described below should be interpreted with caution, as the evidence is very low certainty due to heterogeneity, risk of bias, small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals. Moreover, we do not know the minimal clinically important difference in CFU. Use of a high-volume evacuator (HVE) may reduce bacterial contamination in aerosols less than one foot from a patient’s mouth, but not at longer distances (3 splitmouth RCTs, 122 participants). One RCT (50 participants) found that there may be no difference in CFU between a combination system (Isolite) and a saliva ejector during AGPs or after AGPs. One split-mouth RCT (10 participants) found that there may be a reduction in CFU with rubber dam at one metre and two-metre distance. One RCT of 47 dental students found use of rubber dam may make no difference in CFU at the forehead and occipital region of the operator. One split-mouth RCT (21 participants) found that rubber dam plus HVE may reduce CFU more than cotton roll plus HVE on the patient’s chest and dental unit light. One split-mouth CCT (2 participants) used a local stand-alone air cleaning system (ACS), which may reduce aerosol contamination during cavity preparation or ultrasonic scaling. Another CCT (50 participants) found that laminar flow in the dental clinic combined with a HEPA filter may reduce contamination approximately 76 cm from the floor and 20 cm to 30 cm from the patient’s mouth. Two RCTs evaluated use of anti microbial coolants during ultra sonic scaling. Compared with dis tilled water, coolant-containing chlorhexidine (CHX), cinnamon extract coolant or povidone iodine may reduce CFU. AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS We found no studies that evaluated disease transmission via aerosols in a dental setting; and no evidence about viral contamination in aerosols. All of the included studies measured bacterial contamination using CFU. There appeared to be some benefit from the interventions, but the available evidence is very low certainty so we are unable to draw reliable conclusions.",,"Dental rubber dam,Dental-oral procedure Decontamination,Infection,Prevention",10.19256/d.cadmos.10.2020.05,http://dx.doi.org/10.19256/d.cadmos.10.2020.05

This virus is transmitted by air and, therefore, clinical practices with the production of contaminant aerosols are highly at risk. The purpose of this review was to assess the effectiveness of bio-inspired systems, as adjuvants to nonsurgical periodontal therapy, in order to formulate bio-inspired protocols aimed at restoring optimal condition, reducing bacteremia and aerosols generation. Methods: A comprehensive and bibliometric review of articles published in English. Research of clinical trials (RCTs) were included with participants with chronic or aggressive periodontal disease, that have compared benefits for nonsurgical periodontal therapy (NSPT). Results: Seventy-four articles have been included. For probing depth (PPD) there was a statically significant improvement in laser, probiotic, chlorhexidine groups, such as gain in clinical attachment level (CAL). Bleeding on probing (BOP) reduction was statistically significant only for probiotic and chlorhexidine groups. There were changes in microbiological and immunological parameters. Conclusions: The use of bio-inspired systems in nonsurgical periodontal treatment may be useful in reducing risk of bacteremia and aerosol generation, improving clinical, microbiological and immunological parameters, of fundamental importance in a context of global pandemic, where the reduction of bacterial load in aerosols becomes a pivotal point of clinical practice, but other clinical trials are necessary to achieve statistical validity.",,"Bio-inspired,Dental hygiene,Dentistry,Nonsurgical periodontal therapy,Periodontitis",10.3390/jcm9123914,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm9123914

Methods: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Chinese CBM Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese VIP Information, and Wanfang Database from the date of the establishment of each database up to March, 2019. We included randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT) comparing acupuncture versus conventional conventional medicine or comparing acupuncture combined with conventional medicine versus conventional medicine in participants with ulcerative colitis. Two authors screened all references, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data independently. We summarized data using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for binary outcomes. We performed meta-analyses using random effects model. We assessed overall quality of evidence using GRADE. Results: We included 13 RCTs (1030 participants, 515 in the acupuncture group and 515 in the control group). Only one study tested head acupuncture, and the other 12 tested body acupuncture. The treatment duration ranged from 14 to 60 days. Seven trials compared acupuncture alone versus conventional medicine, and six compared acupuncture combined with conventional medicine versus conventional medicine. Acupuncture combined with mesalazine showed better clinical effect (improved clinical symptoms, colonoscopy results and stool examination results) (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.41; 232 participants; 4 trials; low quality evidence) and better colonoscopy curative effect (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.71; 108 participants; 2 trials; moderate quality evidence) compared to mesalazine. Acupuncture showed better clinical effect compared to the combination of metronidazole and sulfasalazine (RR 1.21, 95%CI 1.10, 1.34; 318 participants; 3 trials; moderate quality evidence). There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between groups.

Methods: The primary outcome of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to measure the effect of the intestinal microbiome modification caused by antibiotics on main alloHCT outcomes [graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), treatment-related mortality (TRM), overall survival (OS)]. The secondary outcome concerns the association of antibiotic-mediated disruption of microbiota as indicated by microbiome markers with alloHCT outcomes. We searched MEDLINE, COCHRANE, EMBASE through 14th of October 2019 for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case-control or cohort (prospective/ retrospective) studies that investigate the role of antibiotics and microbiome (as expressed though cultures or markers) on alloHCT outcomes.

Results: Among 402 screened references, 23 studies we deemed eligible for qualitative synthesis; 15 of which were included in meta-analysis. The impact of gut decontamination (measured by genomic or non-genomic markers of microbiota diversity) on GVHD or OS has been analyzed in 14 studies; among them 2 were RCTs. In studies with non-genomic markers, the gut decontamination group tended to have a favorable outcome despite the lack of statistical significance [OR 0.42 (0.13, 1.27), I2= 48%, p=0.12, Graph]. However, in recent studies which used genomic markers, the occurrence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was significantly reduced in patients not receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics as prophylaxis or treatment [OR 1.59 (1.22, 2.08), I2= 0%, p=0.0006, Graph]. When we incorporated RoB on the outcome of intestinal GVHD, we found a positive correlation of intestinal GVHD with gut decontamination [OR 1.77 (1.29, 2.44), I2= 0%, p=0.004]. Patients who received antibiotics as prophylaxis or treatment of neutropenic fever had 10% reduction on OS [RR 0.90 (0.77, 1.06), I2= 78%, p=0.23] compared with controls. Nevertheless, heterogeneity remained high and the outcome was not statistically significant even after the incorporation of RoB, or subgroup analysis of genomic versus non-genomic microbiota methods. Moreover, we confirmed that antibiotic administration increased the risk of TRM by 75% [RR 1.75 (0.96, 3.17), I2= 75%, p=0.07]. Patients with higher microbiota diversity had 86% increase in OS compared to patients with lower diversity [RR 1.86 (0.94, 3.66), p=0.07]. Nevertheless, heterogeneity was high (I2= 88%) due to the lack of a unanimous approach regarding the definition of microbiota diversity. Unfortunately, data were not sufficient to estimate the effect of microbiota on TRM. Conclusions: Our systematic review and meta-analysis confirms that broad-spectrum antibiotics increase the incidence of acute GVHD. Similarly, gut decontamination increases the risk of intestinal GVHD. Despite trends toward statistical significance, available data are not sufficient to support an association of microbiota diversity with TRM and OS. Further RCTs using standardized markers of microbiota diversity are needed to clarify its impact on survival.",,,10.1038/s41409-020-01120-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41409-020-01120-w

The condition affects between 5% and 10% of otherwise healthy individuals at any one point in time and, in most people, runs a relapsing and remitting course. The best described risk factor is acute enteric infection, but irritable bowel syndrome is also more common in people with psychological comorbidity and in young adult women than in the rest of the general population. The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome is incompletely understood, but it is well established that there is disordered communication between the gut and the brain, leading to motility disturbances, visceral hypersensitivity, and altered CNS processing. Other less reproducible mechanisms might include genetic associations, alterations in gastrointestinal microbiota, and disturbances in mucosal and immune function. In most people, diagnosis can be made on the basis of clinical history with limited and judicious use of investigations, unless alarm symptoms such as weight loss or rectal bleeding are present, or there is a family history of inflammatory bowel disease or coeliac disease. Once the diagnosis is made, an empathetic approach is key and can improve quality of life and symptoms, and reduce health-care expenditure. The mainstays of treatment include patient education about the condition, dietary changes, soluble fibre, and antispasmodic drugs. Other treatments tend to be reserved for people with severe symptoms and include central neuromodulators, intestinal secretagogues, drugs acting on opioid or 5-HT receptors, or minimally absorbed antibiotics (all of which are selected according to predominant bowel habit), as well as psychological therapies. Increased understanding of the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome in the past 10 years has led to a healthy pipeline of novel drugs in development.",,,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31548-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31548-8

The management of hidradenitis suppurativa is a challenge and usually consists of both medical and surgical approaches, which must often be combined for best outcome. The introduction of biological therapies, specifically TNFα-inhibitors such as adalimumab, has profoundly changed the therapeutic armamentarium of the disease. Areas covered: The PubMed database was searched using combinations of the following keywords: hidradentis suppurativa, biologic therapy, TNF-α inhibitors, adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, certolizumab pegol, golimumab, adverse effects, pharmacodynamics, pharmacology, adverse events, pharmacokinetics, drug interaction. This article reviews and updates the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, adverse effects, drug interactions of on-label and off-label use of TNF-α inhibitors in HS. Expert opinion: Biologic agents, particularly adalimumab, exhibit clinical efficacy in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. Careful patient selection and close monitoring during treatment are mandatory to provide safe and effective use of the TNF-α inhibitor.

This condition is distinct from acute liver failure and stable progression of cirrhosis in numerous ways, including triggering precipitant factors, systemic inflammation, rapid progression and a potential for recovery. While a clear definition of ACLF has been forwarded from a large European Consortium study, some heterogeneity remains in how patients present and the types of organ failure, depending on whether they are described in Asian or European studies. Active alcoholism, acute alcoholic hepatitis and infections are the most frequent precipitants for ACLF. Underpinning the pathophysiology of ACLF is a state of persistent inflammation and immune dysfunction, collectively driving a systematic inflammatory response syndrome and an increased propensity to sepsis. Prevention and early treatment of organ failure are key in influencing survival. Given increasing organ shortage and more marginal grafts, liver transplantation is a limited resource and emphasises the need for new therapies to improve ACLF outcomes. Recent data indicate that liver transplantation has encouraging outcomes even in patients with advanced ACLF if patients are carefully selected during the permissive window of clinical presentation. ACLF remains a significant challenge in the field of hepatology, with considerable research and resource being channelled to improve upon the definition, prognostication, treatment and unravelling of mechanistic drivers.

Methods: Primary literature review included topics: ""COVID-19,""""SARS,""""MERS,""""gut microbiota,""""probiotics,""""immune system,""""ACE2,""and ""metformin.""Results: Diabetes was prevalent (~11%) among COVID-19 patients and associated with increased mortality (about 3-fold) compared to patients without diabetes. COVID-19 could be associated with worsening diabetes control and new diabetes diagnosis that could be linked to high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors (coronavirus point of entry into the host) in the endocrine pancreas. A pre-existing gut microbiota imbalance (dysbiosis) could contribute to COVID-19 related complications in patients with diabetes. The COVID-19 virus was found in fecal samples (~55%), persisted for about 5 weeks, and could be associated with diarrhea, suggesting a role for gut dysbiosis. ACE2 expressed on enterocytes and colonocytes could serve as an alternative route for acquiring COVID-19. Experimental models proposed some probiotics, including Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, and L. salivarius, as vectors for delivering or enhancing efficacy of anti-coronavirus vaccines. These Lactobacillus probiotics were also beneficial for diabetes. The potential mechanisms for interconnections between coronavirus, diabetes, and gut microbiota could be related to the immune system, ACE2 pathway, and metformin treatment. There were suggestions but no proof supporting probiotics benefits for COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: The data suggested that the host environment including the gut microbiota could play a role for COVID-19 in patients with diabetes.

Since many individuals with CIC experience reflux and use concomitant acid suppression therapy, we explored the impact of concomitant acid suppressor use on the efficacy and safety of plecanatide in adults with CIC. METHODS: Data on two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trials of plecanatide were pooled and results were stratified by concomitant acid suppressor use. For each group, durable overall complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) response rates, changes from baseline in bowel movement frequency, stool consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale), and daily CIC symptom scores (Likert Scale, 0 5 none to 4 5 very severe) were assessed. Safety was analyzed in patients who received ≥1 dose. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat population (n = 2639) included 12.6% of patients with concomitant acid suppressor use. Patients using acid suppressors were 54.8 years (mean), vs 43.9 years in those not using acid suppressors. Gastroesophageal reflux disease was more common in patients using acid suppressors (83.1%), compared to those not on acid suppressors (6.1%). Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were used by 86.4% of patients using acid suppressors with omeprazole as the most common PPI (45.1%); H(2) blockers were used by 17.8% of subjects with ranitidine as the most common H(2) blocker (9.8%). Regardless of acid suppressor use, plecanatide-treated patients demonstrated significant improvements in the durable overall CSBM responder rates (Figure 1) and greater efficacy across almost all reported endpoints (Table 1) vs placebo, with benefits observed as early as Week 1. Comparisons between acid suppressor use groups (yes vs no) were not significantly different for plecanatide-treated patients (both doses, Table 1). Of the plecanatide-treated patients on acid suppressors, 6.4% experienced diarrhea, 1.4% discontinued due to diarrhea, and 2.3% had $ 1 serious adverse event (SAE), compared to 5.0% (diarrhea), 2.1% (discontinued due to diarrhea), and 1.0% (SAE) of patients not using acid suppressors.

CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 46-year-old female with a medical history of psoriatic arthritis was admitted with a two-week history of progressive right upper-quadrant pain, frequent nonbloody diarrhea, tenesmus, and non-bloody emesis. Her immunosuppressant therapy included certolizumab for the past five years and leflunomide for the past 17 months. She denied use of other medications. Initial laboratory evaluation was significant for a mild leukocytosis, lipase of 476 U/L (normal: 12-61 U/L) and C-reactive protein of 50.8 mg/L (normal #8.0 mg/L). A stool pathogen panel including Clostridioides difficile was negative. RUQ ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. Computed-tomography imaging with contrast revealed no evidence of pancreatitis and mild wall thickening with mucosal hyperenhancement, consistent with ileocolitis (Figure A). A subsequent colonoscopy was notable for circumferential, contiguous inflammation throughout the colon but a normal terminal ileum. Sigmoidal inflammation was mild with a decreased vascular pattern, erythema, and mild friability (Figure B). Biopsy of the descending colon (Figure C) demonstrated surface erosion, crypt abscess (arrowhead) and destruction, and increased lamina propria inflammation without the chronic inflammation classically seen in inflammatory bowel disease. Cytomegalovirus immunostaining was negative. Symptoms persisted despite a three-day course of high-dose intravenous steroids. The decision was made to stop leflunomide, the disease-modifying anti-rheumatologic drug, due to select case reports documenting rare leflunomide-induced colitis. Symptoms improved within two weeks of drug cessation, with a reduction of stool frequency to two formed bowel movements daily, resolution of abdominal pain, and improvement of erythema on repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy. DISCUSSION: This case demonstrates the value of a comprehensive medication history and the diagnostic challenge of leflunomide-induced colitis. Patients with rheumatologic diseases are often on medications with adverse gastrointestinal effects, including biologics, steroids, NSAIDs and other immunomodulators. The lack of randomized studies, vague radiologic, endoscopic and histologic findings, as well as the variable onset after medication initiation makes leflunomide-induced colitis a challenging and rare diagnosis.

AZA was discontinued before starting immunotherapy with Ipilimumab and Nivolumab. After 4 cycles of treatment she presented with symptoms of diffuse abdominal cramping, bleeding per rectum and increased bowel frequency. Initial work up revealed CRP 2.5 mg/dL, and stool studies were negative for any bacterial infection. Colonoscopy demonstrated moderate inflammation, Mayo Clinic Endoscopic Score 2 (MCS), extending continuously from the rectum proximally to 35cm from the anal verge, with gradual transition to normal healthy mucosa in the proximal colon. Pathology showed cryptitis and crypt abscesses with focal ulceration in the recto-sigmoid colon. Initial trial of oral prednisone failed to achieve induction.

She was successfully tapered off steroids and achieved clinical and endoscopic remission after 7 months of maintenance therapy with Vedolizumab every eight weeks. Follow-up colonoscopy demonstrated mildly active pan-ulcerative colitis (MCS 1). Subsequently, she was able to resume treatment with Nivolumab monotherapy without any issues. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, there is scarce data on the management of pre-existing IBD in patients with IMC. It is important to raise awareness on the aftermath of discontinuing IBD therapy for patients who are anticipating immunotherapy. Switching to therapies with a better safety profile and no systemic immunosuppression, like anti-integrins, might be a possible option both prior to and during immunotherapy. More robust data in the form of randomized clinical trials will be needed to further elucidate the use of Vedolizumab as first-line therapy for IMC in patients with underlying IBD.",,,10.14309/01.ajg.0000711064.00932.a9,http://dx.doi.org/10.14309/01.ajg.0000711064.00932.a9

It has shown to be efficacious and improves people's immune status to a certain extent to treat HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea on the basis of syndrome differentiation and treatment or Chinese herbs plus conventional treatment. Therefore, it may have a good application potential. Here, we outline a protocol for the systematic review of this health-care intervention, with the aim to evaluate the beneficial effects and safety of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for patients who suffer from HIV/AIDS-associated diarrhea. Randomized controlled trials that compare Chinese herbs with placebo or other effective treatments will be searched and included, in spite of publication status or language. The primary outcomes include diarrhea frequency and fecal character.

The estimated contamination rate of reproccessed gastroscopes: A systematic review and meta-analysis,,"Norgaard Thomsen E.M., Larsen S., Sig Sorensen A.",,2/12/21,United European Gastroenterology Journal (2020) 8:8 SUPPL (709). Date of Publication: 1 Oct 2020,United European Gastroenterology Journal,2020,8,8 SUPPL,709,,1-Oct-20,Conference Abstract,2050-6414,"Introduction: Reusable flexible gastroscopes are challenging to reprocess properly and appropriate reprocessing is essential to assure quality and patient safety. Multiple studies have found that there is a risk that reprocessed patient-ready gastroscopes remain contaminated even when following reprocessing guidelines, which increases the risk of patients acquiring an endoscope-associated infection. Aims & Methods: This study aimed to estimate the contamination rate of reusable patient-ready gastroscopes. A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed and Embase to identify studies, in which gastroscopes have been cultured for microbiological growth after reprocessing. The publication date for the studies was from January 2010 to May 6, 2020. Only full-text papers on randomized controlled trials and observational studies were included. Publication languages included English and the Scandinavian languages. Both thesaurus and free-text searches were performed. Only studies with a sample size of 10 samples or more were included to estimate the contamination rate. The outcome of the random effects model was a pooled contamination rate of patient-ready reusable gastroscopes based on each included study. Inconsistency index (I2) statistics were used to analyze inter-study heterogeneity and publication bias was assessed using Egger's regression test and funnel plots. Results: In the systematic literature review, 2,071 studies were found via PubMed and 1,624 studies via Embase. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the search was narrowed down to 45 studies which were reviewed in full detail. Five studies met the inclusion criteria and the total sample size included 524 samples from gastroscopes, of which 97 were contaminated. Studies were excluded if they did not state the total number of samples from the gastroscopes and the number of which that were contaminated. Included studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Taiwan, and China. The pooled contamination rate was 22.31% +/-0.061 (95% CI: 0.1021-0.3340). I2 was 66.54% which was considered moderate heterogeneity. Egger's regression test was significant for publication bias (p< 0.01). Conclusion: The contamination rate of patient-ready reusable gastroscopes was estimated to be 22.31% based on currently available literature. Significant publication bias and a small sample size should be considered. More high-quality studies should be performed to investigate the true contamination rate of reprocessed gastroscope more thoroughly and to assess the infection risk associated with contaminated gastroscopes.",,,10.1177/2050640620927345,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2050640620927345

Several mechanisms might explain this comorbidity, such as inflammation and immune activation; intestinal permeability; perturbations in the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis; neurotransmitter/neuropeptide dysregulation; dietary deficiencies; and disturbed gut microbiome composition. The potential of modulating the microbiome–gut–brain axis, and subsequently mental health, through the use of functional foods, is an emerging and novel topic of interest. Fermented foods are considered functional foods due to their putative health benefits. The process of microbial fermentation converts food substrates into more nutritionally and functionally rich products, resulting in functional microorganisms (probiotics), substrates that enhance proliferation of beneficial bacteria in the gut (prebiotics), and bioactive components (biogenics). These functional ingredients act biologically in the gastrointestinal tract and have the ability to modify the gut microbiota, influence translocation of endotoxins and subsequent immune activation, and promote host nutrition. This narrative review explores the theoretical potential of the functional components present in fermented foods to alter gut physiology and to impact the biological mechanisms thought to underpin depression and anxiety. Pre-clinical studies indicate the benefits of fermented foods in relieving perturbed gut function and for animal models of depression and anxiety. However, in humans, the literature relating to the relevance of fermented food for treating or preventing depression and anxiety is sparse, heterogeneous and has significant limitations. This review identifies a critical research gap for further evaluation of fermented foods in the management of depression anxiety in humans.",,"anxiety,biogenics,depression,fermented foods,gut health,prebiotics,probiotics",10.1080/1028415X.2018.1544332,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1028415X.2018.1544332

It is known that oral antibiotics manipulate the gut microbiota; however, the impact on host metabolism of obese adults without bacterial infection has not been systematically summarized. Methods: We searched for randomized, placebo-controlled trials that investigated the effects of oral antibiotics on the metabolic status in obese adults via Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Primary outcomes were homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), body weight, and rate of diarrhea. Additional outcomes included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), waist circumference, fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels, and all adverse events. We assessed the certainty of evidence based on Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations. Results: Among 1,762 articles screened, four studies were eligible for quantitative analysis, two of which were applied to meta-analysis. Oral antibiotics had low influence on HOMA-IR [mean difference (MD) 0.09 (95% CI: -0.96 to 1.13)], body weight [MD 4.1 kg (95% CI: -23.77 to 31.97)], FPG [MD -0.12 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.47 to 0.23)], and GLP-1 [MD 0.20 pmol/L (95% CI: -2.36 to 2.76)] compared to placebo. Antibiotics treatment altered fecal acetate and butyrate levels, but resulted in little difference in propionate levels [MD -13.60 µmol/g (95% CI: -22.43 to -4.77), MD -7.60 µmol/g (-10.97 to -4.23), MD -1.10 µmol/g (95% CI: -4.18 to 1.98), respectively]. Several adverse events, such as sun sensitivity and gastrointestinal discomfort, were reported following antibiotics treatment, but no diarrhea. The certainty of evidence for most outcomes was very low to low, except for fecal SCFAs. Conclusions: Our results indicate that oral antibiotics treatment is insufficient to ameliorate metabolic parameters in obese adults, suggesting that oral antibiotics treatment may not qualify as a therapeutic approach for obesity.",,"Antibiotics,Meta-analysis,Overweight,Systematic review",10.21037/atm-20-1007a,http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-1007a

Date of Publication: 14 Aug 2020,Frontiers in Physiology,2020,11,,,,14-Aug-20,Article,1664-042X (electronic),"Background: In COVID 19 related lung disease, which is a leading cause of death from this disease, cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) may be pivotal in the pathogenesis. TNF alpha reduces fluid absorption due to impairment of sodium and chloride transport required for building an osmotic gradient across epithelial cells, which in the airways maintains airway surface liquid helping to keep airways open and enabling bacterial clearance and aids water absorption from the alveolar spaces. TNF alpha can, through Rho-kinase, disintegrate the endothelial and epithelial cytoskeleton, and thus break up intercellular tight junctional proteins, breaching the intercellular barrier, which prevents flooding of the interstitial and alveolar spaces with fluid. Hypotheses: (1) Preservation and restoration of airway and alveolar epithelial sodium and chloride transport and the cytoskeleton dependent integrity of the cell barriers within the lung can prevent and treat COVID 19 lung disease. (2) TNF alpha is the key mediator of pulmonary edema in COVID 19 lung disease. Confirmation of hypothesis and implications: The role of a reduction in the function of epithelial sodium and chloride transport could with regards to chloride transport be tested by analysis of chloride levels in exhaled breath condensate and levels correlated with TNF alpha concentrations. Reduced levels would indicate a reduction of the function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel and a correlation with TNF alpha levels indicative of its involvement. Anti-TNF alpha treatment with antibodies is already available and needs to be tested in randomized controlled trials of COVID 19 lung disease. TNF alpha levels could also be reduced by statins, aspirin, and curcumin. Chloride transport could be facilitated by CFTR activators, including curcumin and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Sodium and chloride transport could be further regulated to prevent accumulation of alveolar fluid by use of Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(−) cotransporter type 1 inhibitors, which have been associated with improved outcome in adults ventilated for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in randomized controlled trials. Primary prevention of coronavirus infection and TNF alpha release in response to it could be improved by induction of antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and human beta defensin-2 and reduction of TNF alpha production by vitamin D prophylaxis for the population as a whole.",,"acute lung injury,acute respiratory distress syndrome,conductance regulator chloride channel,epithelial sodium channel,furosemide,Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(−) cotransporter type 1 cystic fibrosis transmembrane,pulmonary edema,tumor necrosis factor",10.3389/fphys.2020.00872,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00872

Date of Publication: 8 Aug 2020,Systematic Reviews,2020,9,1,,,8-Aug-20,Review,2046-4053 (electronic),"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at particular risk during pandemics and epidemics of highly virulent diseases with significant morbidity and case fatality rate. These diseases include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Ebola. With the current (SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic, it is critical to delineate appropriate contextual respiratory protection for HCWs. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) as part of respiratory protection versus another device (egN95/FFP2) on HCW infection rates and contamination. Methods: Our primary outcomes included HCW infection rates with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, Ebola, or MERS when utilizing PAPR. We included randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and observational studies. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL). Two reviewers independently screened all citations, full-text articles, and abstracted data. Due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we did not conduct a meta-analysis. Where applicable, we constructed evidence profile (EP) tables for each individual outcome. Confidence in cumulative evidence for each outcome was classified according to the GRADE system. Results: We identified 689 studies during literature searches. We included 10 full-text studies. A narrative synthesis was provided. Two on-field studies reported no difference in the rates of healthcare workers performing airway procedures during the care of critical patients with SARS-CoV-2. A single simulation trial reported a lower level of cross-contamination of participants using PAPR compared to alternative respiratory protection. There is moderate quality evidence that PAPR use is associated with greater heat tolerance but lower scores for mobility and communication ability. We identified a trend towards greater self-reported wearer comfort with PAPR technology in low-quality observational simulation studies. Conclusion: Field observational studies do not indicate a difference in healthcare worker infection utilizing PAPR devices versus other compliant respiratory equipment. Greater heat tolerance accompanied by lower scores of mobility and audibility in PAPR was identified. Further pragmatic studies are needed in order to delineate actual effectiveness and provider satisfaction with PAPR technology.

Date of Publication: 6 Aug 2020,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2020,2020,8,,,6-Aug-20,Review,1465-1858,"Background: Postpartum constipation, with symptoms, such as pain or discomfort, straining, and hard stool, is a common condition affecting mothers. Haemorrhoids, pain at the episiotomy site, effects of pregnancy hormones, and haematinics used in pregnancy can increase the risk of postpartum constipation. Eating a high-fibre diet and increasing fluid intake are usually encouraged. Although laxatives are commonly used in relieving constipation, the effectiveness and safety of available interventions for preventing postpartum constipation should be ascertained. This is an update of a review first published in 2015. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of interventions for preventing postpartum constipation. Search methods: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, and two trials registers ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (7 October 2019), and screened reference lists of retrieved trials. Selection criteria: We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any intervention for preventing postpartum constipation versus another intervention, placebo, or no intervention in postpartum women. Interventions could include pharmacological (e.g. laxatives) and non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. acupuncture, educational and behavioural interventions). Quasi-randomised trials and cluster-RCTs were eligible for inclusion; none were identified. Trials using a cross-over design were not eligible. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened the results of the search to select potentially relevant trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and the certainty of the evidence, using the GRADE approach. We did not pool results in a meta-analysis, but reported them per study. Main results: We included five trials (1208 postpartum mothers); three RCTs and two quasi-RCTs. Four trials compared a laxative with placebo; one compared a laxative plus a bulking agent versus the same laxative alone, in women who underwent surgical repair of third degree perineal tears. Trials were poorly reported, and four of the five trials were published over 40 years ago. We judged the risk of bias to be unclear for most domains. Overall, we found a high risk of selection and attrition bias. Laxative versus placebo. We included four trials in this comparison. Two of the trials examined the effects of laxatives that are no longer used; one has been found to have carcinogenic properties (Danthron), and the other is not recommended for lactating women (Bisoxatin acetate); therefore, we did not include their results in our main findings. None of the trials included in this comparison assessed our primary outcomes: pain or straining on defecation, incidence of postpartum constipation, or quality of life; or many of our secondary outcomes. A laxative (senna) may increase the number of women having their first bowel movement within 24 hours after delivery (risk ratio (RR) 2.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.24 to 3.75; 1 trial, 471 women; low-certainty evidence); may have little or no effect on the number of women having their first bowel movement on day one after delivery (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.22; 1 trial, 471 women; very low-certainty evidence); may reduce the number of women having their first bowel movement on day two (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.45; 1 trial, 471 women; low-certainty evidence); and day three (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.89; 1 trial, 471 women; low-certainty evidence); and may have little or no effect on the number of women having their first bowel movement on day four after delivery (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.87; 1 trial, 471 women; very low-certainty evidence), but some of the evidence is very uncertain. Adverse effects were poorly reported. Low-certainty evidence suggests that the laxative (senna) may increase the number of women experiencing abdominal cramps (RR 4.23, 95% CI 1.75 to 10.19; 1 trial, 471 women). Very low-certainty evidence suggests that laxatives taken by the mother may have little or no effect on loose stools in the baby (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.41; 1 trial, 281 babies); or diarrhoea (RR 2.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 26.82; 1 trial, 281 babies). Laxative plus bulking agent versus laxative only. Very low-certainty evidence from one trial (147 women) suggests no evidence of a difference between these two groups of women who underwent surgical repair of third degree perineal tears; only median and range data were reported. The trial also reported no evidence of a difference in the incidence of postpartum constipation (data not reported), but did not report on quality of life. Time to first bowel movement was reported as a median (range); very low-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference between the two groups. A laxative plus bulking agent may increase the number of women having any episode of faecal incontinence during the first 10 days postpartum (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.23; 1 trial, 147 women; very low-certainty evidence). The trial did not report on adverse effects of the intervention on babies, or many of our secondary outcomes. Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to make general conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of laxatives for preventing postpartum constipation. The evidence in this review was assessed as low to very low-certainty evidence, with downgrading decisions based on limitations in study design, indirectness and imprecision. We did not identify any trials assessing educational or behavioural interventions. We identified four trials that examined laxatives versus placebo, and one that examined laxatives versus laxatives plus stool bulking agents. Further, rigorous trials are needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of laxatives during the postpartum period for preventing constipation. Trials should assess educational and behavioural interventions, and positions that enhance defecation. They should report on the primary outcomes from this review: pain or straining on defecation, incidence of postpartum constipation, quality of life, time to first bowel movement after delivery, and adverse effects caused by the intervention, such as: nausea or vomiting, pain, and flatus.",,,10.1002/14651858.CD011625.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011625.pub3

To date, very few pharmacogenetic studies on dabigatran were published. We aimed to investigate the influence of 59 polymorphisms in 15 genes (including CES1, UGT and CYP that encode enzymes and ABCB1 and SLC that encode transporters), concomitant treatment with pantoprazole and demographic characteristics (including sex or race) on dabigatran pharmacokinetics and safety. Methods: This was a candidate gene pharmacogenetic study. The study population comprised 107 volunteers enrolled in two dabigatran bioequivalence clinical trials; they were genotyped with a ThermoFisher QuantStudio 12K Flex OpenArray instrument. SPSS software v.21 was used for statistical analysis. Results: Women showed a higher exposure to dabigatran compared to men. The concomitant treatment with pantoprazole was associated with a decreased exposure to the drug. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs) were related to lower clearance (Cl/F) (p = 0.049) and a tendency was observed towards higher area under the curve (AUC), maximum concentration (C(max)) and to lower volume of distribution (V(d)/F) (p < 0.10). SLC22A1 haplotype was related to pharmacokinetic variability (p < 0.05). The remaining genes (including CYP, UGT1A1 and ABCB1) had no effect on dabigatran pharmacokinetics (p > 0.10). Women showed more adverse drug reactions (ADR) compared to men (0.40 ± 0.68 vs 0.15 ± 0.41 ADR per person, p = 0.03) and SLC22A1 mutant haplotype was related to a lower risk of nausea (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Sex, concomitant use of pantoprazole and SLC22A1, CYP2D6 and CYP3A5 polymorphism had an effect on dabigatran pharmacokinetics and safety.

Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted among 494 children under 5 years of age in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This study was nested within the randomised controlled trial of the Cholera Hospital-Based Intervention for 7 Days (CHoBI7) mobile health (mHealth) program. The CHoBI7 mHealth program focuses on promoting handwashing with soap and water treatment to diarrhoea patients and their household members through mobile messages and a single in person visit. Mouthing and handling of faeces and fomites among young children was measured by five-hour structured observation and caregiver reports. Diarrhoea surveillance data was collected monthly for 12 months. Results: Fifty five percent of caregivers reported that their child put a visibly dirty fomite (object or soil) in their mouth in the past week. Caregivers reported that 50% of children had mouthed visibly dirty objects, 26% had mouthed dirt, and 2% had mouthed faeces. Forty five percent of children were observed mouthing a visibly dirty fomite during structured observation, 40% of children were observed mouthing a visibly dirty object, 10% were observed mouthing soil, and one child (0.2%) was observed mouthing faeces. Mouthing of visibly dirty fomites was highest for children 12-18 months of age with 69% of these children having caregiver reports and 54% having observed events. Children with caregiver reports of mouthing faeces had a significantly higher odds of diarrhoea over the subsequent month (Odds Ratio: 4.54; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.06, 19.48). Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that mouthing of contaminated fomites among young children is frequent in urban environments in Bangladesh, and that mouthing faeces is associated with a significantly higher odds of diarrhoea. Interventions are urgently needed to protect young children from faecal pathogens in their play spaces.",,"Bangladesh,child mouthing,diarrhoea,fomites,prospective cohort study,structured observation",10.1111/tmi.13413,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tmi.13413

A meticulous history and comprehensive digital rectal examination can provide clarity on the diagnosis, appropriate testing, and management of these conditions. Today, with the development of sophisticated diagnostic tools such as high-resolution and high-definition (3-D) anorectal manometry, 3-D anal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance defecography and imaging, and neurophysiological tests such as translumbosacral anorectal magnetic stimulation, it is possible to more accurately define and characterize the underlying structural and functional abnormalities.

Exploring Treatments for Idiopathic Chronic Diarrhoea (ICD) In Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta): A Systematic Review,,Robinson H.,,10/11/22,Animal Technology and Welfare (2022) 21:2 (128-130). Date of Publication: 1 Aug 2020,Animal Technology and Welfare,2022,21,2,128,130,1-Aug-20,Conference Abstract,1742-0385,"Introduction Idiopathic Chronic Diarrhoea (ICD) is an intestinal disorder prevalent in captive Non-Human primates (NHPs). It is characterised by recurrent loose stool in the absence of classically presented diarrhoeal causing pathogens (Westreich et al, 2019).1 Annually, ICD affects upwards of 15% of NHPs in a colony, posing a serious clinical threat disturbing both research and stock (Blackwood et al, 2008).2 Monkey's experiencing ICD are likely to suffer from severe dehydration, weight loss, and poor body condition. Often leading to a rapid decline in individual welfare accounting for 33% of euthanasia unrelated to research.2 The Pathogenesis of ICD is poorly understood. It is complex and seemingly multifactorial. However, an inflammatory component is strongly implicated. Histopathologic analysis of colonic tissue specimens from primates suffering from ICD, indicate surface gut epithelium changes such as goblet cell depletion (Ardeshir et al., 2013).3 A compromised mucosal barrier allows for increased bacterial attachment leading to dysbiosis of the mucosal microbiota (Broadhurst et al 2012).4 A decreased microbial diversity causes an imbalance in normal gut flora (Figure 1). Commensal bacteria may become pathogenic and trigger an immune response that leads to inflammation. Method A systematic review was conducted on three different databases Research Gate, Web of Science, and Sematic Scholar. A carefully directed search query was utilised to retrieve the most relevant articles. (Figure 2) The articles yielded were screened. All duplicates and irrelevant papers were removed. A strict inclusion and exclusion criteria was developed to select articles based on their relevance to the topic and their novel implications for use in an animal research centre. All randomised clinical trials exploring potential treatments that worked on stool consistency charts were selected. (Figure 3) The data collected was grouped in order of the most efficient and practical way of managing ICD in a research centre. Results Six randomised clinical trials (RCT), that included the use of a stool sample consistency charts, met the criteria and were included in the analysis. The RCT's were separated into treatment categories and presented in the table below (Table 1). Data was subtracted from the articles and presented in the form of a graph (Graph 1). Clinical success was measured by improvement in stool consistency. The percentage of Rhesus macaques that showed improvement was calculated and compared with the placebo group. One RCT was eligible for coconut treatment. Only one primate out of five achieved a favourable response compared with two out of five for the placebo group. The outcome was not statistically significant. One RCT was eligible for Antibiotic Treatment (Tylosin). Seven out of eleven primates displayed clinical improvement when compared with the placebo where one out of ten showed improvement. The outcome was statistically significant. Discussion Coconut The benefits of coconut are attributable to its lauric acid component which has antimicrobial properties that supposedly contribute to a healthy gut microbiome. Although the article retrieved expressed a less than favourable outcome, the small sample size and the form coconut was delivered (coconut macaroons) may have impacted the results. Coconut oil has been proven to show clinical success in mouse-models with induced Colitis (Alok, 2013).5 Perhaps, exploration into different methods of coconut consumptions and treatment quantities could hold more favourable findings. In any case coconut potentially provides an attractive option for treatment, it is palatable non-invasive and can easily be incorporated into enrichment. Although all three RCT's for prebiotics were eligible, the full articles were not accessible. Retrieving specific data was unsuccessful. However, all three articles expressed statistical significance for treatment group when compared with the placebo group. Antibiotics Although the antibiotic Tylosin showed a significant improvement in faecal stools, 39% of primates suffered a relapse, suggesting continued use of treatment is necessary to maintain positive results. Long-term antibiotic use is associated with a host of disorders and the risk of developing antibiotic resistant bacteria. Furthermore, antibiotics may not be an ideal candidate for macaques on study as it may interfere with test compounds and have major impacts on results. Prebiotics Prebiotics are indigestible substances, usually a carbohydrate that promote the growth of healthy bacteria by supplying nutrition. Improved gut flora reduces inflammation and alleviates symptoms. All three articles retrieved, expressed clinical improvement in treatment groups when compared to the placebo. A major drawback in this review was the failure to have full access to the data presented. Prebiotics like Inulin have been reported to cause side effects such as nausea and stomach pain in humans. Access to more research is essential in evaluating prebiotics as a treatment plan. Conclusions Considering the scale of ICD in primate colonies, the gap in the literature is prevalent. Clinical management of the disease is often difficult and unrewarding largely due to the lack of knowledge surrounding pathogenesis. Ideally, the best course action would be preventative care. A study by The National Primate Research Centre in California involving 1,930 R.macaques supported a relationship between stressors and the development of ICD. Particularly on primates that exhibit more gentle personality traits (Gottlieb et al, 2018).6 Applying refinement techniques and providing a fully enriched environment may well negate the effects of ICD. However, within research stressors such as procedures as well as rehousing and disturbances in social hierarchy is often unavoidable. In these cases, the necessity of research into treatment may be the only viable option. Treatment is essential in providing healthy candidates for research as well as improving welfare standards and accuracy of results.",,,,

Purpose: To conduct a narrative review that summarizes data on the efficacy and safety of two common probiotic strains–Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis BB-12 (BB-12)–when administered to children. Methods: Our search of the PubMed database identified 13 meta-analyses, three systematic reviews, and 15 randomized, controlled trials that assessed BB-12 and LGG, either alone or in combination, when administered to infants to improve growth or to children of any age to prevent or treat acute gastroenteritis (AGE), antibiotic- or healthcare-associated diarrhea (AAD and HAD, respectively), respiratory infections, otitis media, and functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Results: Our review found evidence that LGG can prevent AAD and improve the symptoms of AGE, particularly among children in Europe. However, we found only moderate evidence regarding the benefits of LGG for treating respiratory infections and IBS in children and minimal evidence to support the use of BB-12. While no serious safety concerns were identified, LGG was associated with two non-serious safety concerns of wheezing and viral skin infections. Conclusions: We propose that LGG can be safely administered to toddlers and older children to manage the symptoms of AGE and prevent AAD. These findings should be considered for incorporation into clinical practice guidelines and should help to focus the efforts of the probiotic industry.",,"BB-12,Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis BB-12,children,Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG,LGG,meta-analyses,Probiotic,randomized controlled trials,systematic reviews",10.1080/00325481.2020.1731214,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2020.1731214
Potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia in people with chronic kidney disease,,"Natale P., Palmer S.C., Ruospo M., Saglimbene V.M., Strippoli G.F.M.",7/14/20,7/15/20,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020) 2020:6 Article Number: CD013165. Date of Publication: 2 Jul 2020,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2020,2020,6,,,2-Jul-20,Review,1469-493X (electronic),"Background: Hyperkalaemia is a common electrolyte abnormality caused by reduced renal potassium excretion in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Potassium binders, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate and calcium polystyrene sulfonate, are widely used but may lead to constipation and other adverse gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, reducing their tolerability. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer ion exchange resins for treatment of hyperkalaemia which may cause fewer GI side-effects. Although more recent studies are focusing on clinically-relevant endpoints such as cardiac complications or death, the evidence on safety is still limited. Given the recent expansion in the available treatment options, it is appropriate to review the evidence of effectiveness and tolerability of all potassium exchange resins among people with CKD, with the aim to provide guidance to consumers, practitioners, and policy-makers. Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of potassium binders for treating chronic hyperkalaemia among adults and children with CKD. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 10 March 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled studies (quasi-RCTs) evaluating potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia administered in adults and children with CKD. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed risks of bias and extracted data. Treatment estimates were summarised by random effects meta-analysis and expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence interval (CI). Evidence certainty was assessed using GRADE processes. Main results: Fifteen studies, randomising 1849 adult participants were eligible for inclusion. Twelve studies involved participants with CKD (stages 1 to 5) not requiring dialysis and three studies were among participants treated with haemodialysis. Potassium binders included calcium polystyrene sulfonate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, patiromer, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. A range of routes, doses, and timing of drug administration were used. Study duration varied from 12 hours to 52 weeks (median 4 weeks). Three were cross-over studies. The mean study age ranged from 53.1 years to 73 years. No studies evaluated treatment in children. Some studies had methodological domains that were at high or unclear risks of bias, leading to low certainty in the results. Studies were not designed to measure treatment effects on cardiac arrhythmias or major GI symptoms. Ten studies (1367 randomised participants) compared a potassium binder to placebo. The certainty of the evidence was low for all outcomes. We categorised treatments in newer agents (patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) and older agents (calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate). Patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate may make little or no difference to death (any cause) (4 studies, 688 participants: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.11, 4.32; I(2) = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. The treatment effect of older potassium binders on death (any cause) was unknown. One cardiovascular death was reported with potassium binder in one study, showing that there was no difference between patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo for cardiovascular death in CKD and HD. There was no evidence of a difference between patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at the end of treatment (one study) in CKD or HD. Potassium binders had uncertain effects on nausea (3 studies, 229 participants: RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.65, 6.78; I(2) = 0%; low certainty evidence), diarrhoea (5 studies, 720 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.47, 1.48; I(2) = 0%; low certainty evidence), and vomiting (2 studies, 122 participants: RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.35 to 8.51; I(2) = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. Potassium binders may lower serum potassium levels (at the end of treatment) (3 studies, 277 participants: MD -0.62 mEq/L, 95% CI -0.97, -0.27; I(2) = 92%; low certainty evidence) in CKD and HD. Potassium binders had uncertain effects on constipation (4 studies, 425 participants: RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.71, 3.52; I(2) = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. Potassium binders may decrease systolic blood pressure (BP) (2 studies, 369 participants: MD -3.73 mmHg, 95%CI -6.64 to -0.83; I(2) = 79%; low certainty evidence) and diastolic BP (one study) at the end of the treatment. No study reported outcome data for cardiac arrhythmias or major GI events. Calcium polystyrene sulfonate may make little or no difference to serum potassium levels at end of treatment, compared to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (2 studies, 117 participants: MD 0.38 mEq/L, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.79; I(2) = 42%, low certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in systolic BP (one study), diastolic BP (one study), or constipation (one study) between calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate. There was no difference between high-dose and low-dose patiromer for death (sudden death) (one study), stroke (one study), myocardial infarction (one study), or constipation (one study). The comparative effects whether potassium binders were administered with or without food, laxatives, or sorbitol, were very uncertain with insufficient data to perform meta-analysis. Authors' conclusions: Evidence supporting clinical decision-making for different potassium binders to treat chronic hyperkalaemia in adults with CKD is of low certainty; no studies were identified in children. Available studies have not been designed to measure treatment effects on clinical outcomes such as cardiac arrhythmias or major GI symptoms. This review suggests the need for a large, adequately powered study of potassium binders versus placebo that assesses clinical outcomes of relevance to patients, clinicians and policy-makers. This data could be used to assess cost-effectiveness, given the lack of definitive studies and the clinical importance of potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia in people with CKD.",,,10.1002/14651858.CD013165.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013165.pub2

A critical factor in the development of HCC from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Moreover, current pharmacological treatments such as pioglitazone and vitamin E have limited effects on fibrosis, a key risk factor in HCC progression. As NAFLD is becoming more prevalent in developed countries due to rising rates of obesity, a need for directed treatment is imperative. Numerous novel therapies including PPAR agonists, anti-fibrotic therapies and agents targeting inflammation, oxidative stress and the gut-liver axis are currently in development, with the aim of targeting key processes in the progression of NASH and HCC.

In absence of any effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), remdesivir has been tried for a compassionate use in severe COVID-19. Newer randomized controlled studies that have recently become available, showed a mixed result. We aimed to systematically search the literature to understand the pharmacology and clinical effects of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed, ClinicalTrial.Org and MedRxiv database up till May 5, 2020 using specific key words such as “Remdesivir” or ‘GS-5734″ AND “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” and retrieved all the article published in English language, that have reported the pharmacology and the clinical outcomes of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. Results: Initial compassionate use of remdesivir has shown a fairly good result, but difficult to quantify, in the absence of control arm. While the very first double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial conducted in Wuhan, did not find any significant benefit compared to the control, the preliminary result of another similar multi-country trial has shown a significant faster time to recovery but without any difference in mortality.

Renal impairment is not a consistently cited risk factor for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI). We examined the association between renal impairment and rCDI and the effect of bezlotoxumab, an anti-toxin B monoclonal antibody, in reducing rCDI in participants with renal impairment. Methods. We pooled data from 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trials conducted in participants receiving bezlotoxumab or placebo infusion during oral antibacterial drug treatment for CDI. We assessed the association between renal impairment and rCDI in placebo-treated participants and evaluated the effect of bezlotoxumab vs placebo in reducing rCDI among participants with renal impairment, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <90 mL/min. Results. The proportion of placebo-treated participants experiencing rCDI within 12 weeks was higher in those with renal impairment (n = 919) vs those without renal impairment (n = 612; 36.6% and 27.7%, respectively; difference, 8.9%; 95% CI, 1.3% to 16.3%). Renal impairment was significantly associated with a higher rate of recurrence in placebo-treated participants lacking commonly recognized risk factors for rCDI (renal impairment as only risk factor, 28.8%; vs normal renal function and no risk factors, 12.5%; difference, 16.3%; 95% CI, 3.4% to 28.8%). Among all participants with renal impairment, the rate of rCDI was 19.5% among bezlotoxumab-treated vs 36.6% among placebo-treated participants (difference, -17.1%; 95% CI, -23.4% to -10.6%). Conclusions. This post hoc analysis adds to the literature suggesting an association of renal impairment as an independent risk factor for rCDI and provides preliminary evidence that patients with renal impairment who suffer with CDI may benefit from adjunctive treatment with bezlotoxumab.",,"Bezlotoxumab,Clostridioides difficile,Recurrence,Renal dysfunction",10.1093/ofid/ofaa248,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa248

With increasing rates of caesarean section, it is important to minimise risks to the mother as much as possible. This review focused on different skin preparations to prevent infection. This is an update of a review last published in 2018. Objectives: To compare the effects of different antiseptic agents, different methods of application, or different forms of antiseptic used for preoperative skin preparation for preventing postcaesarean infection. Search methods: For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (9 July 2019), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials, evaluating any type of preoperative skin preparation (agents, methods or forms). We included studies presented only as abstracts, if there was enough information to assess risk of bias. Comparisons of interest in this review were between: different antiseptic agents (e.g. alcohol, povidone iodine), different methods of antiseptic application (e.g. scrub, paint, drape), different forms of antiseptic (e.g. powder, liquid), and also between different packages of skin preparation including a mix of agents and methods, such as a plastic incisional drape, which may or may not be impregnated with antiseptic agents. We mainly focused on the comparison between different agents, with and without the use of drapes. Only studies involving the preparation of the incision area were included. This review did not cover studies of preoperative handwashing by the surgical team or preoperative bathing. Data collection and analysis: Three review authors independently assessed all potential studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, extracted the data and checked data for accuracy. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included 13 individually-randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with a total of 6938 women who were undergoing caesarean section. Twelve trials (6916 women) contributed data to this review. The trial dates ranged from 1983 to 2016. Six trials were conducted in the USA, and the remainder in India, Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa, France, Denmark, and Indonesia. The included studies were broadly at low risk of bias for most domains, although high risk of detection bias raised some specific concerns in a number of studies. Length of stay was only reported in one comparison. Antiseptic agents. Parachlorometaxylenol with iodine versus iodine alone. We are uncertain whether parachlorometaxylenol with iodine made any difference to the incidence of surgical site infection (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 2.99; 1 trial, 50 women), or endometritis (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.38; 1 trial, 50 women) when compared with iodine alone, because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Adverse events (maternal or neonatal) were not reported. Chlorhexidine gluconate versus povidone iodine. Moderate-certainty evidence suggested that chlorhexidine gluconate, when compared with povidone iodine, probably slightly reduces the incidence of surgical site infection (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.91; 8 trials, 4323 women). This effect was still present in a sensitivity analysis after removing four trials at high risk of bias for outcome assessment (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.23; 4 trials, 2037 women). Low-certainty evidence indicated that chlorhexidine gluconate, when compared with povidone iodine, may make little or no difference to the incidence of endometritis (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.86; 3 trials, 2484 women). It is uncertain whether chlorhexidine gluconate reduces maternal skin irritation or allergic skin reaction (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.46; 3 trials, 1926 women; very low certainty evidence). One small study (60 women) reported reduced bacterial growth at 18 hours after caesarean section for women who had chlorhexidine gluconate preparation compared with women who had povidone iodine preparation (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.70). Methods. Drape versus no drape. This comparison investigated the use of drape versus no drape, following preparation of the skin with antiseptics. Low-certainty evidence suggested that using a drape before surgery compared with no drape, may make little or no difference to the incidence of surgical site infection (RR 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.71; 3 trials, 1373 women), and probably makes little or no difference to the length of stay in the hospital (mean difference (MD) 0.10 days, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.46; 1 trial, 603 women; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial compared an alcohol scrub and iodophor drape with a five-minute iodophor scrub only, and reported no surgical site infection in either group (79 women, very-low certainty evidence). We were uncertain whether the combination of a one-minute alcohol scrub and a drape reduced the incidence of metritis when compared with a five-minute scrub, because the certainty of the evidence was very low (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.29 to 9.16; 1 trial, 79 women). The studies did not report on adverse events (maternal or neonatal). Authors' conclusions: Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that preparing the skin with chlorhexidine gluconate before caesarean section is probably slightly more effective at reducing the incidence of surgical site infection in comparison to povidone iodine. For other outcomes examined there was insufficient evidence available from the included RCTs. Most of the evidence in this review was deemed to be very low or low certainty. This means that for most findings, our confidence in any evidence of an intervention effect is limited, and indicates the need for more high-quality research. Therefore, it is not yet clear what sort of skin preparation may be most effective for preventing postcaesarean surgical site infection, or for reducing other undesirable outcomes for mother and baby. Well-designed RCTs, with larger sample sizes are needed. High-priority questions include comparing types of antiseptic (especially iodine versus chlorhexidine), and application methods (scrubbing, swabbing, or draping). We found two studies that are ongoing; we will incorporate the results of these studies in future updates of this review.",,,10.1002/14651858.CD007462.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007462.pub5
"Effect of household water treatment with chlorine on diarrhea among children under the age of five years in rural areas of Dire Dawa, eastern Ethiopia: A cluster randomized controlled trial",,"Solomon E.T., Robele S., Kloos H., Mengistie B.",7/8/20,7/9/20,Infectious Diseases of Poverty (2020) 9:1 Article Number: 64. Date of Publication: 8 Jun 2020,Infectious Diseases of Poverty,2020,9,1,,,8-Jun-20,Article,"2049-9957 (electronic),2095-5162","Background: Diarrheal disease is a leading cause of child mortality and morbidity worldwide. Household water treatment with chlorine significantly reduces morbidity due to waterborne diseases. However, the effect of point-of-use (POU) water treatment in improving the quality of water in areas where POU is not provided free of charge and the effectiveness of home visits in inspiring household members to use POU regularly have not been studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of drinking water disinfection by chlorination on diarrheal disease reduction among children under the age of 5 years in rural eastern Ethiopia. Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was carried out in rural Dire Dawa from October 2018 through January 2019. The 405 households were randomized to intervention and control arms and intervention materials were distributed after conducting a baseline survey. This trial evaluated the effectiveness of household drinking water disinfection by chlorination in reducing incidence of diarrhea among children under the age of 5 years. Intervention households received 1.2% sodium hypochlorite with demonstration of its proper use. Participants in the control households continued with their usual habits of water collection and water storage. Generalized estimation equation (GEE) with log link Poisson distribution family and exchangeable correlation matrix was used to compute crude incidence rate ratio (IRR), adjusted IRR and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Results: In the intervention households, in total, 281 cases of diarrhea were documented (8.7 cases per 100 person-weeks observation); in the control households, in total 446 cases of diarrhea were documented (13.8 cases per 100 person-weeks observation). A 36.0% (adjusted IRR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.57-0.73) reduction in incidence of diarrhea was observed in the intervention arm when compared with the control arm. The highest and the lowest reductions were obtained in children of age ranges 1 to 2 years and 3 to 4 years, 42.7 and 30.4%, respectively. Adherence to the intervention was 81.3% as measured by free residual chlorine test. Conclusions: In rural areas where diarrhea is the second leading cause of morbidity, water chlorination at the household level using liquid bleach considerably reduced episodes of diarrhea among children under the age of 5 years. Therefore, chlorinating drinking water at the household level may be a valuable interim solution for reducing the incidence of diarrheal diseases until potable water is made accessible to the majority of the population in Dire Dawa Administration and other Ethiopian communities.",,"Cluster randomized controlled trial,Diarrhea,Effect,Ethiopia,Under-five children,Water treatment with chlorine,WaterGuard",10.1186/s40249-020-00680-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00680-9

Date of Publication: 3 Jun 2020,Trials,2020,21,1,,,3-Jun-20,Article,1745-6215 (electronic),"Background: Almost 15% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) will require a proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) as a result of fulminant colitis, dysplasia, cancer, or medical refractory diseases. Around 50% will experience pouchitis, an idiopathic inflammatory condition involving the ileal reservoir, responsible for digestive symptoms, deterioration in quality of life, and disability. Though the majority of initial cases of pouchitis are easily managed with a short course of antibiotics, in about 10% of cases, inflammation of the pouch becomes chronic with very few treatments available. Previous studies have suggested that manipulating the composition of intestinal flora through antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics achieved significant results for treating acute episodes of UC-associated pouchitis. However, there is currently no established effective treatment for chronic antibiotic-dependent pouchitis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a novel therapy involving the transfer of normal intestinal flora from a healthy donor to a patient with a medical condition potentially caused by the disrupted homeostasis of intestinal microbiota or dysbiosis. Methods: Our project aims to compare the delay of relapse of chronic recurrent pouchitis after FMT versus sham transplantation. Forty-two patients with active recurrent pouchitis after having undergone an IPAA for UC will be enrolled at 12 French centers. The patients who respond to antibiotherapy will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to receive either FMT or sham transplantation. Discussion: On April 30, 2014, the World Health Organization published an alarming report on antibiotic resistance. Finding an alternative medical treatment to antibiotics in order to prevent relapses of pouchitis is therefore becoming increasingly important given the risk posed by multiresistant bacteria. Moreover, if the results of this study are conclusive, FMT, which is less expensive than biologics, could become a routine treatment in the future.

Patients bear a significant risk of cholangiocarcinoma and colorectal cancer, and frequently have concomitant inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune disease manifestations. To date, no medical therapy has proven significant impact on clinical outcomes and most patients ultimately need liver transplantation. Several treatment strategies have failed in the past and whilst prescription of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) prevails, controversy regarding benefits remains. Lack of statistical power, slow and variable disease progression, lack of surrogate biomarkers for disease severity and other challenges in trial design serve as critical obstacles in the development of effective therapy. Advances in our understanding of PSC pathogenesis and biliary physiology over recent years has however led to a surge of clinical trials targeting various mechanistic compartments and currently raising hopes for imminent changes in patient management. Here, in light of pathophysiology, we outline and critically evaluate emerging treatment strategies in PSC, as tested in recent or ongoing phase II and III trials, stratified per a triad of targets of nuclear and membrane receptors regulating bile acid metabolism, immune modulators, and effects on the gut microbiome. Furthermore, we revisit the UDCA trials of the past and critically discuss relevant aspects of clinical trial design, including how the choice of endpoints, alkaline phosphatase in particular, may affect the future path to novel, effective PSC therapeutics.",,"Alkaline phosphatase,Primary sclerosing cholangitis,Study design,Therapy",10.1007/s00535-020-01681-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00535-020-01681-z

Methodology We analyzed individual participant-level data from 16 studies (13 single-arm or cohort studies and three randomized trials), amounting to 683 preschool-age children (aged <6 years) and 2,010 school-age children (aged 6–14 years). Children had a documented Schistosoma mansoni or S. haematobium infection, were treated with single 40 mg/kg oral praziquantel, and assessed between 21 and 60 days post-treatment. Efficacy was expressed as arithmetic mean and individual egg reduction rate (ERR) and meta-analyzed using general linear models and mixed models. Safety was summarized using reported adverse events (AEs). Principal findings Preschool-age children had significantly lower baseline Schistosoma egg counts and more losses to follow-up compared to school-age children. No difference in efficacy was found between preschool-and school-age children using a general linear model of individual-par-ticipant ERR with baseline log-transformed egg count as covariate and study, age, and sex as fixed variables, and a mixed model with a random effect on the study. Safety was reported in only four studies (n = 1,128 individuals); few AEs were reported in preschool-age children 4 and 24 hours post-treatment as well as at follow-up. Three severe but not serious AEs were recorded in school-age children during follow-up. Conclusions/Significance There is no indication that single 40 mg/kg oral praziquantel would be less efficacious and safe in preschool-age children compared to school-age children, with the caveat that only few randomized comparisons exist between the two age groups. Preventive chemotherapy might therefore be extended to preschool-age children, with proper monitoring of its efficacy and safety.",,,10.1371/journal.pntd.0008277,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008277
Does suboptimal household flooring increase the risk of diarrhoea and intestinal parasite infection in low and middle income endemic settings? A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol,,"Sartorius B., Legge H., Pullan R.",6/1/20,7/10/20,Systematic Reviews (2020) 9:1 Article Number: 113. Date of Publication: 20 May 2020,Systematic Reviews,2020,9,1,,,20-May-20,Article,2046-4053 (electronic),"Background: Water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions often fail to show long-term impact on diarrhoeal and/or intestinal parasite risk in many low- A nd middle-income countries. Less attention has been paid to wider contextual factors that may contribute to high levels of contamination in the domestic environment such as household flooring. The purpose of this study will be to assess the association between diarrhoeal and/or intestinal parasite infection status and unimproved/unfinished flooring in low- A nd middle-income countries. Methods: We will conduct a comprehensive search of published studies (randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and observational studies) that examined the association between unimproved/unfinished household flooring and diarrhoeal and/or intestinal parasite infection status from January 1, 1980, onwards with no language restriction. The primary outcome will include diarrhoeal and/or intestinal parasite infection status. Databases to be searched include EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The secondary outcome will be the association between specific pathogens (laboratory confirmed) and unimproved/unfinished household flooring. Independent screening for eligible studies using defined criteria and data extraction will be completed in duplicate and independently. Any discrepancies between the two reviewers will be resolved by consensus and/or arbitration by a third researcher. If data permits, random effects models will be used where appropriate. Subgroup and additional analyses will be conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity (e.g. age group, geographical region) and potential risk of bias of included studies. Discussion: This review will provide a comprehensive examination of a possible association between suboptimal household flooring and increased risk of enteric pathogen infection, highlight gaps for future research in high risk areas, and inform intervention design for future planned studies in Kenya and/or elsewhere in the region.

Although genetic, neuroendocrine, and metabolic causes have been stated to lead to PCOS, the etiology of PCOS remains unclear. Recent studies in humans and rodent models have shown an association between changes in the gut microbiome and the metabolic and clinical parameters of PCOS. In addition, it has been proposed that dysbiosis of gut microbiota may be a potential pathogenetic factor in the development of PCOS. In this context, modification of gut microbiota with probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic agents suggests that these products may serve as new treatment options for PCOS. In this review, it is aimed to explain the relationship between PCOS and gut microbiota with possible mechanisms and to examine the new treatment approaches that can be developed in this direction. Key teaching points Studies have shown that gut microbiota may be a potential pathogenetic factor in the development of PCOS. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota in women with PCOS appears to be associated with PCOS phenotypes. Studies suggest that insulin resistance, sex hormone concentrations, and obesity may affect the diversity and composition of gut microbiota in women with PCOS.

Secondary bile acid profiles have been postulated as a potential marker for cirrhosis progression. Modulating gut microbiota dysbiosis using a nonsystemic antibiotic such as rifaximin may beneficially impact the bile acid pool. This post hoc subanalysis evaluated fecal bile acid profiles in patients with early decompensated cirrhosis treated with rifaximin soluble solid dispersion (SSD) tablets, an investigational rifaximin formulation with improved water solubility, while maintaining minimal systemic exposure. Methods: In a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial, adults with cirrhosis and ascites (grade ≥1), with no history of esophageal variceal bleeding or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, received rifaximin SSD or placebo once nightly for 24 weeks (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01904409). This post hoc subanalysis evaluated data from patients receiving rifaximin SSD immediate-release (IR) tablets 40 mg (most efficacious dose) or placebo once daily. Stool samples were collected at screening (Day -21 to Day -7), after 24 weeks of treatment, and at 2 weeks post-treatment (Week 26). Bile acids were extracted from stool and profiles were determined using highperformance liquid chromatography, per published methods (Kakiyama G, et al. J Lipid Res. 2014;55[5]:978-990). Results: Stool samples were analyzed for 48 patients in rifaximin SSD IR 40-mg group and 50 patients in the placebo group. At screening, mean (SD) total fecal bile acid concentrations were 12.2 (18.6) and 8.2 (9.8) µmol/g of stool for rifaximin SSD IR 40 mg and placebo, respectively; 3.8 (10.8) and 1.6 (3.2) µmol/g of stool for primary bile acids; and 7.7 (10.2) and 5.7 (8.4) µmol/g of stool sample for secondary bile acids. A significantly higher mean concentration of total and secondary bile acids were observed in the rifaximin SSD IR 40-mg group versus placebo at Weeks 24 and 26 (Figure): for total bile acids, the difference was 0.6 µmol/g (95% CI, 0.1-1.1; P=0.02), and for secondary bile acids, 0.9 µmol/g (95% CI, 0.0-1.7; P=0.046). Conclusions: Rifaximin SSD IR 40 mg once daily for 24 weeks increased the total and secondary fecal bile acid concentrations versus placebo in patients with early decompensated cirrhosis. This indicates that rifaximin SSD IR treatment has an impact on gut microbial function. Larger trials are warranted on rifaximin SSD IR and the role of fecal bile acid profiles as a marker for disease progression and complications of cirrhosis.

The prevalence of constipation-related complaints tends to increase with age. There are limited data regarding safety and efficacy of guanylate cyclase-C receptor agonists in the elderly. This analysis pooled data from plecanatide phase 3 trials in CIC and IBS-C to assess its safety and efficacy in patients aged ≥65 years (yrs). Methods: Populations from 2 CIC and 2 IBS-C trials of patients randomized to plecanatide 3 mg, plecanatide 6 mg, or placebo were combined for post hoc analysis. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were collected and are reported for patients ≥65 yrs and <65 yrs old, using descriptive statistics. The 4 trials shared a number of secondary efficacy endpoints related to constipation that allowed the CIC and IBS-C trial populations to be combined: changes in stool consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale [BSFS]), changes in the weekly frequency of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) and spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs), and time from start of therapy to first CSBM and first SBM. Results: The pooled safety population comprised 468 patients aged ≥65 yrs (mean: 70.0 yrs) and 4505 patients aged <65 yrs (mean: 42.0 yrs), of whom 302 and 3017, respectively, were randomized to plecanatide. The most common TEAE was diarrhea (Table 1), with rates in the pooled plecanatide dose groups similar in the older and younger cohorts. No cases of serious diarrhea were reported. Rates of discontinuation and diarrhea-related discontinuation in the plecanatide groups were low in both the older and younger cohorts. No new safety signals were observed. Efficacy data for patients aged ≥65 yrs were consistent with those in the full study populations and patients aged <65 yrs (Table 2). There were statistically significant improvements in stool consistency from baseline with plecanatide 3 and 6 mg versus placebo at Week 12, both in patients aged ≥65 yrs and in those aged <65 yrs. Changes from baseline in mean weekly CSBM frequency and mean weekly SBM frequency at Week 12 were numerically greater in the plecanatide groups, compared with placebo; differences were statistically significant versus placebo in the plecanatide 3 mg group in patients aged ≥65 yrs and in both plecanatide groups in patients aged <65 yrs. Furthermore, the times from the start of therapy to first CSBM and first SBM were significantly shorter in the plecanatide groups than in the placebo group in patients aged <65 yrs (P< 0.001 for both) and in patients aged ≥65 yrs. Discussion: Results, which include a meaningful number of elderly patients, indicate that plecanatide is a well-tolerated and effective treatment option for patients aged ≥65 yrs with CIC and IBS-C.",,,10.1016/S0016-5085(20)31676-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0016-5085(20)31676-0
ACID SUPPRESSION THERAPY DOES NOT AFFECT THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY PROFILE OF PLECANATIDE: A PATIENT-LEVEL POOLED ANALYSIS OF TWO LARGE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS IN CHRONIC IDIOPATHIC CONSTIPATION,,"Moshiree B., Schoenfeld P., Patel R., Rezaie A.",,6/2/20,Gastroenterology (2020) 158:6 Supplement 1 (S-395). Date of Publication: 1 May 2020,Gastroenterology,2020,158,6,S-395,,1-May-20,Conference Abstract,"1528-0012 (electronic),0016-5085","Introduction: Plecanatide replicates the pH-sensitive activity of uroguanylin in binding to guanylate cyclase-C receptors expressed on intestinal epithelium. This binding leads to chloride first, then water secretion into the intestinal lumen, followed by movement of stool through the colon. Since plecanatide works through a pH-dependent mechanism, this post hoc analysis was performed to explore the impact of concomitant acid suppressor use on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of plecanatide 3 or 6 mg in adults with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). Methods: Efficacy and safety data from two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trials of plecanatide were pooled. Patients were stratified by concomitant acid suppressor use. The following measures were assessed: changes from baseline at 12 weeks in complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM), spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) frequency, stool consistency as measured by the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), and daily CIC symptom scores, which were measured on a 5-point Likert Scale (0=none to 4=very severe). Standard safety evaluations were conducted in both studies. Results: Of the total pooled population, 12.6% (n=339/2683) received concomitant acid suppression medication (plecanatide 3 mg, n=107/896; plecanatide 6 mg, n=113/890; placebo, n=119/897). Most patients on acid suppression medication had gastroesophageal reflux disease (83.2%, n=282), compared with 6% (n=141) of those not on acid suppression medication. Among patients using acid suppression medications, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were used by 86.3% of plecanatide patients and 85.8% of placebo patients; H(2) blockers were also used similarly (18.1% plecanatide vs 17.5% placebo). Efficacy results from patients using acid suppressors were consistent with those in patients not using acid suppressors. Plecanatide treatment demonstrated statistically significantly greater efficacy compared with placebo across efficacy endpoints (p<0.001), including more regular and well-formed bowel movements, improvement in straining, bloating, and abdominal pain, and improved patient-reported constipation symptoms irrespective of concomitant acid suppressor use (Table 1). The treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) profile showed no new safety signals among patients using acid suppression medication. The most common TEAE was diarrhea, which was experienced in 6.2% of patients using acid suppressors and 4.6% of those who did not in the plecanatide-treated group. Patients discontinued plecanatide treatment due to diarrhea in 1.3% of the acid suppression group and 2% of the non–acid suppression group. Discussion: Plecanatide has shown to be efficacious and safe in patients taking acid suppression medication and can be administered with concomitant acid suppression medication without impacting efficacy or safety.",,,10.1016/S0016-5085(20)31678-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0016-5085(20)31678-4
Personal protective equipment for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff,,"Verbeek J.H., Rajamaki B., Ijaz S., Sauni R., Toomey E., Blackwood B., Tikka C., Ruotsalainen J.H., Kilinc Balci F.S.",5/14/20,7/19/22,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020) 2020:4 Article Number: CD011621. Date of Publication: 15 Apr 2020,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2020,2020,4,,,15-Apr-20,Review,1465-1858,"Background: In epidemics of highly infectious diseases, such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or coronavirus (COVID-19), healthcare workers (HCW) are at much greater risk of infection than the general population, due to their contact with patients' contaminated body fluids. Personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk by covering exposed body parts. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is the best way to put PPE on (i.e. donning) or to remove PPE (i.e. doffing), and how to train HCWs to use PPE as instructed. Objectives: To evaluate which type of full-body PPE and which method of donning or doffing PPE have the least risk of contamination or infection for HCW, and which training methods increase compliance with PPE protocols. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL to 20 March 2020. Selection criteria: We included all controlled studies that evaluated the effect of full-body PPE used by HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases, on the risk of infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. We also included studies that compared the effect of various ways of donning or doffing PPE, and the effects of training on the same outcomes. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in included trials. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses were appropriate. Main results: Earlier versions of this review were published in 2016 and 2019. In this update, we included 24 studies with 2278 participants, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCT), one was a quasi-RCT and nine had a non-randomised design. Eight studies compared types of PPE. Six studies evaluated adapted PPE. Eight studies compared donning and doffing processes and three studies evaluated types of training. Eighteen studies used simulated exposure with fluorescent markers or harmless microbes. In simulation studies, median contamination rates were 25% for the intervention and 67% for the control groups. Evidence for all outcomes is of very low certainty unless otherwise stated because it is based on one or two studies, the indirectness of the evidence in simulation studies and because of risk of bias. Types of PPE. The use of a powered, air-purifying respirator with coverall may protect against the risk of contamination better than a N95 mask and gown (risk ratio (RR) 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.43) but was more difficult to don (non-compliance: RR 7.5, 95% CI 1.81 to 31.1). In one RCT (59 participants), people with a long gown had less contamination than those with a coverall, and coveralls were more difficult to doff (low-certainty evidence). Gowns may protect better against contamination than aprons (small patches: mean difference (MD) −10.28, 95% CI −14.77 to −5.79). PPE made of more breathable material may lead to a similar number of spots on the trunk (MD 1.60, 95% CI −0.15 to 3.35) compared to more water-repellent material but may have greater user satisfaction (MD −0.46, 95% CI −0.84 to −0.08, scale of 1 to 5). Modified PPE versus standard PPE. The following modifications to PPE design may lead to less contamination compared to standard PPE: sealed gown and glove combination (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), a better fitting gown around the neck, wrists and hands (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55), a better cover of the gown-wrist interface (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78, low-certainty evidence), added tabs to grab to facilitate doffing of masks (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31). Donning and doffing. Using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for doffing may lead to less contamination compared to no guidance (small patches: MD −5.44, 95% CI −7.43 to −3.45). One-step removal of gloves and gown may lead to less bacterial contamination (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.77) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28) than separate removal. Double-gloving may lead to less viral or bacterial contamination compared to single gloving (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28). Additional spoken instruction may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD −0.9, 95% CI −1.4 to −0.4) and to fewer contamination spots (MD −5, 95% CI −8.08 to −1.92). Extra sanitation of gloves before doffing with quaternary ammonium or bleach may decrease contamination, but not alcohol-based hand rub. Training. The use of additional computer simulation may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD −1.2, 95% CI −1.6 to −0.7). A video lecture on donning PPE may lead to better skills scores (MD 30.70, 95% CI 20.14 to 41.26) than a traditional lecture. Face-to-face instruction may reduce noncompliance with doffing guidance more (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) than providing folders or videos only. Authors' conclusions: We found low- to very low-certainty evidence that covering more parts of the body leads to better protection but usually comes at the cost of more difficult donning or doffing and less user comfort, and may therefore even lead to more contamination. More breathable types of PPE may lead to similar contamination but may have greater user satisfaction. Modifications to PPE design, such as tabs to grab, may decrease the risk of contamination. For donning and doffing procedures, following CDC doffing guidance, a one-step glove and gown removal, double-gloving, spoken instructions during doffing, and using glove disinfection may reduce contamination and increase compliance. Face-to-face training in PPE use may reduce errors more than folder-based training. We still need RCTs of training with long-term follow-up. We need simulation studies with more participants to find out which combinations of PPE and which doffing procedure protects best. Consensus on simulation of exposure and assessment of outcome is urgently needed. We also need more real-life evidence. Therefore, the use of PPE of HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases should be registered and the HCW should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection.",,,10.1002/14651858.CD011621.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011621.pub4
Anthelmintic drugs for treating ascariasis,,"Conterno L.O., Turchi M.D., Corrêa I., Monteiro de Barros Almeida R.A.",5/14/20,5/20/20,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020) 2020:4 Article Number: CD010599. Date of Publication: 14 Apr 2020,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2020,2020,4,,,14-Apr-20,Review,1469-493X (electronic),"Background: Ascaris lumbricoides is a common infection, and mainly affects children living in low-income areas. Water and sanitation improvement, health education, and drug treatment may help break the cycle of transmission, and effective drugs will reduce morbidity. Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety of anthelmintic drugs (albendazole, mebendazole, ivermectin) for treating people with Ascaris infection. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, three other databases, and reference lists of included studies, without language restrictions, up to 4 July 2019. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCT) that compared albendazole, mebendazole, and ivermectin in children and adults with confirmed Ascaris infection. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from the included trials. A third review author checked the quality of data extraction. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool to determine the risk of bias in included trials. We used risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare dichotomous outcomes in treatment and control groups. We used the fixed-effect model for studies with low heterogeneity and the random-effects model for studies with moderate to high heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used the control rate average to provide illustrative cure rates in the comparison groups. Main results: We included 30 parallel-group RCTs, which enrolled 6442 participants from 17 countries across Africa, Asia, Central America and the Caribbean, and South America. Participants were from 28 days to 82 years of age, recruited from school, communities, and health facilities. Twenty studies were funded or co-funded by manufacturers, while 10 studies were independent of manufacturer funding. Twenty-two trials had a high risk of bias for one or two domains (blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting). Single dose of albendazole (four trials), mebendazole (three trials) or ivermectin (one trial) was compared to placebo. Parasitological cure at 14 to 60 days was high in all the studies (illustrative cure of 93.0% in the anthelmintic group and 16.1% in the placebo group; RR 6.29, 95% CI 3.91 to 10.12; 8 trials, 1578 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Single dose of albendazole is as effective as multiple doses of albendazole (illustrative cure of 93.2% with single dose, 94.3% with multiple doses; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.05; 3 trials, 307 participants; high-certainty evidence); or as single dose of mebendazole (illustrative cure of 98.0% with albendazole, 96.9% with mebendazole; RR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.02; 6 trials, 2131 participants; high-certainty evidence). Studies did not detect a difference between a single dose of albendazole and a single dose of ivermectin (cure rates of 87.8% with albendazole, 90.2% with ivermectin; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.08; 3 trials, 519 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Across all the studies, failure after single dose of albendazole ranged from 0.0% to 30.3%, mebendazole from 0.0% to 22.2%, and ivermectin from 0.0% to 21.6%. The egg reduction rate (ERR) measured up to 60 days after the treatment was high in all treated groups, regardless of the anthelmintic used (range 96% to 100%). It was not possible to evaluate parasitological cure by classes of infection intensity. No included trials reported complication or serious adverse events. Other adverse events were apparently similar among the compared anthelmintic groups (moderate- to low-certainty evidence). The most commonly reported other adverse events were nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, headache, and fever. Authors' conclusions: Single-dose of albendazole, mebendazole, and ivermectin all appeared effective against Ascaris lumbricoides infection, yielding high parasitological cure and large reductions in eggs excreted, with no differences detected between them. The drugs appear to be safe to treat children and adults with confirmed Ascaris infection. There is little to choose between drugs and regimens in terms of cure or adverse events.",,,10.1002/14651858.CD010599.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010599.pub2
Is coverage of S. aureus necessary in cellulitis/erysipelas? A literature review,,Karakonstantis S.,12/24/19,4/20/20,Infection (2020) 48:2 (183-191). Date of Publication: 1 Apr 2020,Infection,2020,48,2,183,191,1-Apr-20,Review,"1439-0973 (electronic),0300-8126","Background: Empirical treatment of patients with cellulitis/erysipelas usually targets both streptococci and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). However, the recommendation to empirically cover MSSA is weak and based on low-quality evidence. Methods and objective: A systematic review was conducted in PubMed and clinical trial registries to assess the role of S. aureus in cellulitis/erysipelas and the need for empirical MSSA coverage. Results: Combined microbiological and serological data, and response to penicillin monotherapy suggest that streptococci are responsible for the vast majority of cases of cellulitis/erysipelas. However, most cases are non-culturable and the specificity of microbiological and serological studies is questionable based on recent studies using molecular techniques. According to epidemiological data and three randomized controlled trials, empirical coverage of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is not recommended for most patients, despite the high prevalence of MRSA in many areas. If MRSA is indeed not an important cause of uncomplicated cellulitis/erysipelas, then the same may apply to MSSA. Based on indirect comparison of data from clinical studies, cure rates with penicillin monotherapy (to which most MSSA are resistant) are comparable to the cure rates reported in many studies using wider-spectrum antibiotics. Conclusion: Considering the limitations of microbiological studies in identifying the pathogens responsible for cellulitis/erysipelas, treatment needs to be guided by clinical trials. Trials comparing penicillin or amoxicillin monotherapy to MSSA-covering regimens are needed to definitively answer whether empirical coverage of MSSA is needed and to identify the subset of patients that can be safely treated with penicillin or amoxicillin monotherapy.",,"Cellulitis,Erysipelas,MRSA,MSSA,Penicillin,Staphylococcus aureus,Treatment",10.1007/s15010-019-01382-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s15010-019-01382-7

For this reason, a prompt diagnosis is fundamental to early treatment and the prevention of transmission. The aim of this article is to review diagnostic laboratory methods that are now available to detect C. difficile and to discuss the most recent recommendations on CDI treatment in children. Currently, there is no consensus on the best method for detecting C. difficile. Indeed, none of the available diagnostics possess at the same time high sensitivity and specificity, lowcost and rapid turnaround times. Appropriate therapy is targeted according to age, severity and recurrence of the episode of infection, and the recent availability of new antibiotics opens new opportunities. De-escalation of antibiotics that are directly associated with CDI remains a priority and the cautious use of probiotics is recommended. Vancomycin represents the first-line therapy for CDI, although in children metronidazole can still be used as a first-line drug. Fidaxomicin is a new treatment option with equivalent initial response rates as vancomycin but lower relapse rates of CDI. Faecal microbiota transplantation should be considered for patients with multiple recurrences of CDI. Monoclonal antibodies and vaccines seem to represent a future perspective against CDI.

Results: Sixty-five papers were eligible for inclusion. With the exception of H pylori-induced conditions, overarching gastric microbiota signatures of health or disease could not be determined. Gastric carcinogenesis induces a progressively altered microbiota with an enrichment of oral and intestinal taxa as well as significant changes in host gastric mucin expression. Proton pump inhibitors usage increases gastric microbiota richness. Bariatric surgery is associated with an increase in potentially pathogenic proteobacterial species in patient stool samples. Conclusion: While H pylori remains the single most important risk factor for gastric disease, its capacity to shape the collective gastric microbiota remains to be fully elucidated. Further studies are needed to explore the intricate host/microbial and microbial/microbial interplay.",,,10.1111/apt.15650,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/apt.15650

To control the disease, safe and effective vaccines are being used in several countries. We assessed the impact of vaccination on the risk factors for acute rotavirus diarrhea (ARD) in Bangladesh. Methods: We used the data of a cluster-randomized trial. The clusters were 142 villages, 71 in each of the two arms of study. The infants were offered human rotavirus vaccine (HRV), Rotarix, over three-year period. We divided the time period into two equal periods (T1 and T2). A generalized estimating equation with logit-link function was used to evaluate the risk factors by arm and by period. Results: Among 10,917 children, 5,759 (53%) were in the HRV villages. We had 359 cases; 44% in the HRV villages. Mean age of attack was similar between the arms of study in T1, but significantly higher in HRV villages than that in the non-HRV villages in T2. In HRV villages, males were at a higher risk of having ARD than females in T1, but not in T2. In contrast, males were at a higher risk of having ARD in both the time periods in non-HRV villages. In HRV-villages, children having literate mother were at significantly higher risk of having ARD in T1 but not in T2; whereas children in the non-HRV villages had a higher risk of having ARD in T2. Children living in an area with higher phone users had more cases than their counterpart in non-HRV villages, but not in HRV villages. Conclusion: Our study illustrates that several risk factors for ARD varied between the two arms of study as well as between the two periods of study. Assessing post-vaccination risk factors is, therefore, important for understanding the impact of vaccination and undertaking post-vaccination control measures.",,"Bangladesh,Cluster randomized trial,Matlab,Risk factors,Rotarix vaccine,Rotavirus",10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.01.041,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.01.041

Frequent recurrences have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, high healthcare costs, and lower quality of life. In this review, we compare the efficacy of interventions designed to prevent rCDI. We performed a systematic review of the English literature, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated rCDI as an outcome. Studies were included irrespective of patient demographics, disease severity, type of intervention, comparator used, or time-point of outcome evaluation. We performed a comprehensive literature search with the assistance of a research librarian. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Our search yielded 38 RCTs (8,102 participants). Nineteen RCTs (3,743 subjects) evaluated antibiotics, eight fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) (582 subjects), three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (2,805 subjects), and eight probiotics, prebiotics, or non-antibiotic polymers (972 subjects). The antibiotic and FMT therapies that demonstrated efficacy in rCDI prevention included: fidaxomicin (when compared to a ten-day vancomycin course) and FMT administered by nasogastric tube (when compared to a fourteen-day vancomycin course and a fourteen-day vancomycin course plus bowel lavage). Actoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin A; CDA1) plus bezlotoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin B; CDB1) in combination or bezlotoxumab alone appeared to be more effective in preventing rCDI compared to actoxumab alone. Of the prebiotics, probiotics, and nonantibiotic polymers, oligofructose, Saccharomyces boulardii, and the nontoxigenic C. difficile strain M3 were the most efficacious for rCDI prevention. Thirty-eight RCTs (>8,000 participants) evaluating treatment modalities for CDI were examined for efficacy in prevention of rCDI. Several CDI-specific antibiotics, FMT modalities, monoclonal antibodies, and various prebiotics and probiotics demonstrated a reduction in risk of rCDI with the greatest risk reduction observed with FMT and monoclonal antibody therapy. It is notable that the comparators in these studies were very different from one another and the relative risk reduction of rCDI may not be directly comparable from one study to the next.",,"Bezlotoxumab,Fecal microbiota transplant,Fidaxomicin,Probiotic,Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection,Vancomycin",10.1016/j.anaerobe.2019.102098,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2019.102098

A UTI is defined as complicated when urinary tract anatomical abnormalities or urinary devices are present, when it is recurrent and when associated with immunodeficiency. Complicated UTIs (cUTIs) have a higher risk of treatment failure and often require longer antimicrobial treatment courses. cUTIs, especially those which are healthcare-associated, are often due to multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs). Areas covered: This article will review the available evidence in relation to prevention of sepsis in cUTI, evaluating the risk factors associated with sepsis development. Published articles from January 2005 to September 2019 on UTIs and sepsis prevention in complicated UTIs were identified by using MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine Bethesda MD) and by reviewing the references of retrieved articles. Expert opinion: Prevention of sepsis relies on prompt and timely diagnosis of cUTI, early identification of the causative organism, removal of obstructions and source control, proper and adequate empirical/targeted antimicrobial treatment. In particular, source control, i.e. removal of urinary obstructions, infected stents, urinary catheters, nephrostomies, and drainage of hydronephrosis/abscess, is essential for preventing the development and progression of sepsis.",,"antimicrobial resistance,Complicated urinary tract infection,prevention,sepsis,urinary stones",10.1080/14787210.2020.1700794,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2020.1700794

The initial management approach for these disorders is similar, focusing on diet, lifestyle and the use of standard over-the-counter laxatives. If unsuccessful, further therapy is tailored according to subtype.

Although there have been important advances in the knowledge of the pathophysiology of PAH, it remains a debilitating, limiting, and rapidly progressive disease. Vitamin D and iron deficiency are worldwide health problems of pandemic proportions. Notably, these nutritional alterations are largely more prevalent in PAH patients than in the general population and there are several pieces of evidence suggesting that they may trigger or aggravate disease progression. There are also several case reports associating scurvy, due to severe vitamin C deficiency, with PAH. Flavonoids such as quercetin, isoflavonoids such as genistein, and other dietary polyphenols including resveratrol slow the progression of the disease in animal models of PAH. Finally, the role of the gut microbiota and its interplay with the diet, host immune system, and energy metabolism is emerging in multiple cardiovascular diseases. The alteration of the gut microbiota has also been reported in animal models of PAH.

OIC differs from other forms of constipation in that it is an iatrogenic condition that occurs when an opioid acts on the dense network of μ-opioid receptors in the enteric system, which affect a variety of functions including gastrointestinal motility, secretion, and other factors that can cause bowel dysfunction. Unfortunately, laxative products, bowel regimens, dietary changes, and lifestyle modifications have limited effectiveness in preventing OIC, Opioid-associated adverse effect which occurs in 40% to 80% of opioid patients and may led to cessation of the treatment. PAMORAs are μ-receptor opioid antagonists specifically developed so that they have very limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and thus they are able to antagonize peripheral but not central μ-opioid receptors. PAMORAs are designed to have no effect on the analgesic benefits of opioid pain relievers but to relieve but antagonizing the effects of the opioid in the gastrointestinal system. The three main PAMORAS are methyl-trexone (oral or parenteral), naldemedine (oral only), and naloxegol (oral only).

Children under the age of two and elderly individuals are at the great-est risk. Knowledge of this condition is important for an early diagnosis to be made and treatment to be initiated. Objective: The review aimed to familiarize physicians with the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of scabies. Methods: A search was conducted using Pubmed with the built-in ""Clinical Queries"" tool. The search term ""Scabies"" was used. The categories of ""epidemiology"", ""diagnosis"", ""therapy"", ""pre-vention"" and ""prognosis"" had a limited scope for primary clinical studies. Meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews were included. Only papers published in the English language were included. A descriptive, narrative synthesis was provided of the retrieved articles. Results: Worldwide, scabies affects 200 to 300 million individuals annually. The average prevalence is estimated to be 5 to 10% in children of developing countries. Transmission usually occurs after close prolonged skin-to-skin contact. Classic scabies is characterized by an erythematous papular eruption, serpiginous burrows, and intense pruritus. Sites of predilection include the webs of the fingers, volar wrists, lateral aspects of fingers, extensor surfaces of elbows and knees, waist, navel, abdomen, buttocks, groins, and, genitals. A clinical diagnosis of classic scabies can be made on the basis of the history and clinical findings. Other clinical variants include crusted scabies, nodular scabies, and bullous scabies. Finding the mite, ova, or fecal pellets on microscopic examination of scrapings taken from skin lesions confirms the diagnosis of scabies infestation. For eradi-cation of scabies mites, the drugs of choice are topical permethrin and oral ivermectin.

While pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a well-defined disease with established guidelines, Eosinophilic Gastritis (EoG), Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis (EoGE) and Eosinophilic Colitis (EoC) remain a clinical enigma with evidence based on limited anecdotal case reports. Large cross-sectional studies in the US defined a prevalence of EoG and EoGE ranging from 1,5 to 6,4/100.000 and from 2,7 to 8,3/100.000 subjects respectively, while the prevalence of EoC ranges from 1,7 to 3,5/100.000 subjects. Regarding the pathogenesis, it is hypothesized that EGIDs result from the interplay between genetic predisposition, intestinal dysbiosis and environmental triggers. Clinically, EGIDs might present with different and nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms depending on the involved intestinal tract and the extension of eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate. The diagnosis of EGIDs requires: 1. recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms, 2. increased eosinophils for high power field in biopsy specimens, 3. absence of secondary causes of gastrointestinal eosinophilia. No validated guidelines are available on the clinical management of patients with EGIDs. Evidence from case reports and small uncontrolled case series suggests the use of dietary and corticosteroids as the first-line treatments. Considering the clinical follow-up of EGIDs, three different patterns of disease course are identified: single flare, recurring course-disease and chronic course-disease.

Changes in colonic microflora may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, and improvements in the intestinal microflora may relieve the disease. Fecal bacterial transplants and oral probiotics are becoming important ways to relieve active ulcerative colitis. Purpose This systematic review with meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety of basic treatment combined with fecal microbiota transplantation or mixed probiotics therapy in relieving mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Methods The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane libraries (updated September 2019) were searched to identify randomized, placebo-controlled, or head-to-head trials assessing fecal microbiota transplantation or probiotic VSL#3 as induction therapy in active ulcerative colitis. We analyze data using the R program to obtain evidence of direct comparison and to generate intermediate variables for indirect treatment comparisons. Results Seven randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were used as the sources of the induction data. All treatments were superior to placebo. In terms of clinical remission and clinical response to active ulcerative colitis, direct comparisons showed fecal microbiota transplantation (OR = 3.47, 95% CI = 1.93–6.25) (OR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.18–5.21) and mixed probiotics VSL#3 (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.49–3.88) (OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 1.53–6.25) to have better effects than the placebo. Indirect comparison showed fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotic VSL#3 did not reach statistical significance either in clinical remission (RR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.70–2.06) or clinical response (RR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.62–1.45). In terms of safety, fecal microbiota transplantation (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.51–2.61) and VSL #3 (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.33–2.49) showed no statistically significant increase in adverse events compared with the control group. In terms of serious adverse events, there was no statistical difference between the fecal microbiota transplantation group and the control group (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.46–3.57). The probiotics VSL#3 seems more safer than fecal microbiota transplantation, because serious adverse events were not reported in the VSL#3 articles. Conclusions Fecal microbiota transplantation or mixed probiotics VSL#3 achieved good results in clinical remission and clinical response in active ulcerative colitis, and there was no increased risk of adverse reactions. There was no statistical difference between the therapeutic effect of fecal microbiota transplantation and that of mixed probiotics VSL#3. However, the use of fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics still has many unresolved problems in clinical applications, and more randomized controlled trials are required to confirm its efficacy.",,,10.1371/journal.pone.0228846,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228846

Formoterol is a highly selective and potent β(2)-agonist that relaxes airway smooth muscle to significantly improve lung function. Inhaled formoterol works within 5 minutes of administration and provides improvements in spirometry measurements over 12 hours. The lipophilicity of formoterol allows it to form a depot within the smooth muscle to provide a prolonged duration of action. Following therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations are very low or undetectable. Determination of the pharmacokinetics of formoterol following high-dose administration to healthy volunteers revealed that the drug was rapidly absorbed and excreted unchanged in the urine with a half-life of 10 hours. Inhaled formoterol, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents, is an effective and safe treatment option for patients with moderate to severe COPD. Clinical studies have demonstrated improvements in lung function and COPD symptoms, particularly dyspnea; reductions in the risk of exacerbations; and improvement in patients’ health status. The adverse event profile of inhaled formoterol is similar to that of placebo, with few adverse cardiovascular events. Formoterol is a valuable bronchodilator used in the maintenance treatment of COPD. This review describes the mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of inhaled formoterol.

Proton pump inhibitor-amoxicillin-containing high dose dual therapy (HDDT) has been proposed to treat H. pylori infection. We aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of PPI-amoxicillin HDDT for treatment of H. pylori infection in comparison with other regimens. Methods: Databases, including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, were searched to find relevant publications. Randomized controlled trials comparing HDDT with control regimens for H. pylori eradication in adult patients were included. The primary outcome was eradication rate by intention-to-treat analysis. Adverse events were analyzed as second outcome. Results: A total of 15 trials with 3818 patients qualified for inclusion. The eradication rate of HDDT was neither significantly inferior nor superior to the recommended regimens such as triple therapy, bismuth quadruple therapy, and non-bismuth quadruple therapy [relative risk (RR): 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.96–1.05, p = 0.870]. This finding was robust through subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. Trial sequential analysis showed that HDDT was equivalent to control regimens, and further similar trials were unlikely to alter the conclusions of this analysis. The frequency of adverse events was significantly lower in HDDT group (RR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.37–0.64, p < 0.001). Conclusion: HDDT was equivalent to recommended first-line or rescue regimens with fewer adverse effects. The evidence from this meta-analysis supports the use of HDDT as first-line or rescue treatment for H. pylori infection.

Selective intestinal decontamination as a method for preventing infectious complications (review),,"Barsuk A.L., Nekaeva E.S., Lovtsova L.V., Urakov A.L.",2/18/21,3/23/21,Sovremennye Tehnologii v Medicine (2020) 12:6 (86-97).

To date, there is no generally accepted method for preventing such complications in burn injury. One of the possible prevention options is selective intestinal decontamination (SID). This method is based on the enteral administration of non-absorbable antimicrobial agents. The preventive effect of SID involves inhibition of intestinal microflora translocation through the mucous membranes, inasmuch as studies demonstrate that endogenous opportunistic microorganisms are a common cause of infectious complications in various critical conditions. The SID method was originally developed in the Netherlands for patients suffering from mechanical injury. Antimicrobial drugs were selected based on their high activity in relation to the main endogenous opportunistic pathogens and minimal activity against normal intestinal microflora components. The combination of polymyxin (B or E), tobramycin, and amphotericin B with intravenous cefotaxime was chosen as the first SID regimen. Other regimens were proposed afterwards, and the application field of the method was expanded. In particular, it became the method of choice for prevention of infectious complications in patients with severe burn injury. Clinical studies demonstrate efficacy of some SID regimens for preventing infectious complications in patients with thermal injury. Concomitant administration of SID and systemic preventive antibiotics and addition of oropharyngeal decontamination increases the method efficacy. SID is generally well-tolerated, but some studies show an increased risk of diarrhea with this preventive option. In addition, SID increases the risk of developing antibiotic resistance like any other antibiotic regimens.",,"Burn injury,Infectious complications of burn injuries,Selective intestinal decontamination",10.17691/stm2020.12.6.10,http://dx.doi.org/10.17691/stm2020.12.6.10

More than 1.2 billion people have ascariasis worldwide. Objective: This article aimed to provide an update on the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of as-cariasis. Methods: A PubMed search was conducted in February 2020 in Clinical Queries using the key terms “ascariasis” OR “Ascaris lumbricoides”. The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews published within the past 10 years. The search was restricted to English literature. The information retrieved from the above search was used in the compilation of the present article. Patents were searched using the key term “ascariasis” OR “Ascaris lumbricoides” in www.freepatentsonline.com. Results: Ascaris lumbricoides is transmitted through the ingestion of embryonated eggs from fe-cal-contaminated material. Ascariasis has high endemicity in tropical and subtropical areas. Predis-posing factors include poverty, poor sanitation, inadequate sewage disposal, and poor personal hy-giene. The prevalence is greatest in children younger than 5 years of age. The majority of patients with intestinal ascariasis are asymptomatic. For those with symptoms, anorexia, nausea, bloating, abdominal discomfort, recurrent abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and intermittent diarrhea are not uncommon. Other clinical manifestations vary widely, depending on the underlying compli-cations. Complications include Löeffler syndrome, intestinal obstruction, biliary colic, recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, cholecystitis, acalculous cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, and malnutrition. The diagnosis is best established by microscopic examination of fecal smears or following concentration techniques for the characteristic ova. Patients with A. lumbri-coides infection warrant anthelminthic treatment, even if they are asymptomatic, to prevent complications from migration of the parasite. Albendazole and mebendazole are the drugs of choice for children and nonpregnant individuals with ascariasis. Pregnant women with ascariasis should be treated with pyrantel pamoate. Recent patents related to the management of ascariasis are also dis-cussed. Conclusion: The average cure rate with anthelminthic treatment is over 95%. Unfortunately, most treated patients in endemic areas become re-infected within months. Health education, personal hy-giene, improved sanitary conditions, proper disposal of human excreta, and discontinuing the use of human fecal matter as a fertilizer are effective long-term preventive measures. Targeting de-worming treatment and mass anthelminthic treatment should be considered in regions where A. lum-bricoides is prevalent.",,"Albendazole,Ascaris lumbricoides,Biliary obstruction,Intestinal obstruction,Löeffler syndrome,Mebendazole,Pancreatitis,Pyrantel pamoate",10.2174/1872213X14666200705235757,http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1872213X14666200705235757

Since the drug was first launched, much real-world evidence has also been accumulated. The efficacy and safety of saxagliptin, especially its cardiovascular safety, are of particular interest. Areas covered: This review provides an overview of the safety and efficacy of saxagliptin based on observational studies, pharmacovigilance, and meta-analyses. In addition, with the findings of recent cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs), the authors discuss, herein, the efficacious use of saxagliptin. Expert opinion: Saxagliptin exhibits a moderate glucose-lowering effect and is well tolerated by patients with T2D. SAVOR-TIMI 53, a CVOT of saxagliptin, reported neutral effects of saxagliptin in respect of the cardiovascular outcomes, but did raise a concern about the risk of heart failure. Conversely, recent CVOTs on sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have shown a favorably reduced risk of heart failure with these drugs. Also, DPP-4is decrease the serum glucagon level, whereas the SGLT2is increase it. Given the characteristics of the two classes of drugs, combined therapy with the two might be a promising option.",,"Cardiovascular outcome trial,DPP-4 inhibitor,saxagliptin,SGLT2 inhibitor,type 2 diabetes",10.1080/14656566.2020.1803280,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2020.1803280

Berberine has a broad-spectrum antibiotic activity and is very widely used to treat diarrhea in China. No systematic review has been carried out to evaluate the evidence presented in clinical trials. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of berberine in diarrhea treatment among children and adults. Methods: Seven databases and two clinical trial registries were searched on 1 September 2019. Randomized controlled trials were included, where participants were diagnosed (first diagnosed) as having diarrhea according to clear diagnostic criteria. Berberine alone or in combination with Western medication as intervention were included. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on children or adults, acute or persistent diarrhea, infectious or noninfectious and treatment courses. Primary outcomes were clinical cure rate and duration of diarrhea. The GRADE tool was used to assess the quality of evidence. Results: A total of 38 randomized controlled trials were included involving 3948 participants (including 27 trials on 2702 children) were included. Compared with antibiotics, berberine plus antibiotics showed better results in both adults and in children in general, especially when given for 7 days or 3 days in acute infectious diarrhea of children. Compared with the control groups, using berberine alone or in combination with montmorillonite, probiotics, and vitamin B increased the clinical cure rate of diarrhea. The use of berberine alone or berberine combined with montmorillonite reduced the duration of hospitalization. Using berberine had significantly better laboratory indicators (isoenzyme, inflammatory factors, myocardial enzyme, and fecal trait) and fewer systemic symptoms than the no berberine groups. Overall, 22 of 27 trials on children used berberine as an enema. No deaths and serious adverse events were reported. The quality of evidence of included trials was moderate to low or very low. The impact of different dosages, frequencies and treatment durations on the outcomes was not evaluated due to insufficient number of trials. Conclusion: This review demonstrated that berberine was generally effective in improving clinical cure rates and shortening the duration of diarrhea compared with control groups. No severe adverse event was reported. However, there is still a lack of high-quality evidence for evaluating the efficacy and safety of berberine.
