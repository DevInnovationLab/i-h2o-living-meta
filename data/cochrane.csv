Intervention components included latrine upgrades, child feces management tools, and behavioral promotion. It remains unclear which components most impacted diarrhea. METHODS: We conducted mediation analysis within a subset of households (n = 720) from the sanitation and control arms. Potential mediators were categorized into indicators of latrine quality, latrine use practices, and feces management practices. We estimated average causal mediation effects (ACME) as prevalence differences (PD), defined as the intervention's effect on diarrhea through its effect on the mediator. RESULTS: The intervention improved all indicators compared to controls. We found significant mediation through multiple latrine use and feces management practice indicators. The strongest mediators during monsoon seasons were reduced open defecation among children aged < 3 and 3‐8 years, and increased disposal of child feces into latrines. The strongest mediators during dry seasons were access to a flush/pour‐flush latrine, reduced open defecation among children aged 3‐8 years, and increased disposal of child feces into latrines. Individual mediation effects were small (PD = 0.5‐2 percentage points) compared to the overall intervention effect but collectively describe significant mediation pathways. DISCUSSION: The effect of the WASH Benefits Bangladesh sanitation intervention on diarrheal disease was mediated through improved child feces management and reduced child open defecation. Although the intervention significantly improved latrine quality, relatively high latrine quality at baseline may have limited benefits from additional improvements. Targeting safe child feces management may increase the health benefits of rural sanitation interventions.",14,3,765‐778,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 38507184,,,,,Journal article,"*Diarrhea [epidemiology, prevention & control]; *Feces; *Rural Population [statistics & numerical data]; *Sanitation [methods, standards]; *Toilet Facilities [standards, statistics & numerical data]; Bangladesh [epidemiology]; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Mediation Analysis",10.1007/s44197-024-00210-y,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02757110/full,

While access to sanitation facilities is improving, national surveys indicate that even households with latrines often do not safely dispose of their child's feces. Working with caregivers in rural Odisha, India, we co‐developed an intervention aimed at improving safe disposal of child feces and encouraging child latrine use at an earlier age. We describe the rationale for the intervention and summarize the protocol for a cluster randomized trial (CRT) to evaluate its effectiveness at changing CFM practices. METHODS: The intervention consists of six behavior change strategies together with hardware provision: wash basin and bucket with lid to aid safe management of soiled nappies and a novel latrine training mat to aid safe disposal and latrine training. The intervention will be offered at the village level to interested caregivers of children < 5 years of age by a community‐based organization. Following a baseline survey, 74 villages were randomly allocated to either intervention or control arm. The primary outcome is caregiver reported safe disposal of child feces after last defecation, either by the caregiver disposing of the child's feces into the latrine or the child using the latrine, measured approximately four to six months following intervention delivery. Secondary outcomes include fecal contamination of household drinking water and the childs' hands. A process evaluation will also be conducted to assess intervention fidelity and reach, and explore implementer and participant feedback. DISCUSSION: This study addresses a crucial knowledge gap in sanitation by developing a scalable intervention to improve safe management of child feces. The behavior change strategies were designed following the Risks, Attitudes, Norms, Abilities and Self‐Regulation (RANAS) approach, which has shown to be effective for other environmental behavior change interventions in low‐income settings. The latrine training mat hardware is a novel design developed cooperatively and manufactured locally. The evaluation follows a rigorous CRT study design assessing the impact of the intervention on CFM behavior change, as well as fecal contamination of two sources of potential exposure.

We identified key indicators for poultry feces management and investigated their social determinants using data from a baseline survey of a randomized‐controlled trial of a poultry management training program in rural Western Uganda. The baseline survey was conducted in the Masindi and Kiryandongo districts of Uganda in September 2019, and data collected from 609 households were used. We evaluated indicators for poultry feces management behaviors using scale development methods, including descriptive statistics, bivariate correlation analyses, and Factor Analysis of Mixed Data. We also investigated social determinants of key poultry feces management behaviors using logistic and multinomial logistic regression models. A significant increase in odds of having free‐roaming poultry was found for each additional poultry owned (OR = 1.18, P < 0.001). The odds of a household having an observed enclosure for poultry increased by 5% with each incremental poultry owned (OR = 1.05, P < 0.001), and by 4% with increasing wealth with each additional point on the poverty probability index score (OR = 1.04, P < 0.001). Our results also suggest enclosures are intermittently used and constructing them without further intervention likely will not be sufficient for effectively managing animal fecal contamination.

Despite high latrine coverage, only 37% of Indian households safely dispose of their child's feces into a latrine or have the child use the latrine, with the lowest rate in the state of Odisha at 12%. We evaluated a behavior change and hardware intervention designed to improve caregiver safe disposal of child feces and child latrine use. METHODS: We conducted a cluster‐randomized controlled trial among 74 villages in rural Odisha, India. Eligible villages previously participated in a water and sanitation infrastructure program. Following a baseline survey, half the villages were assigned to intervention and half to control. Caregivers of children < 5 years old from households with a latrine were eligible to participate. The intervention included five behavior change activities. Hardware was provided at the first activity, based on child age, to aid safe disposal and latrine training (wash basin and bucket with lid for children < 7 months old; latrine training mat platform with removable tray for children 7 to 48 months old). The primary outcome was caregiver reported 'safe disposal' as defined by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) which encompasses two behaviors: caregiver disposal of child's feces into a latrine and child latrine use. Safe disposal was measured four to six months after intervention delivery (endline). RESULTS: Endline analysis included 665 intervention caregivers (840 children) and 634 control caregivers (785 children). Prevalence of JMP‐defined safe disposal was 1.16 times greater in the intervention arm compared to control (77.7% vs. 65.9%; prevalence ratio [PR] 1.16, 95% CI 1.04‐1.29), with higher prevalence of caregiver safe disposal (18.6% vs. 13.6%; PR 1.46, 95% CI 1.12‐1.92) but no significant difference in child latrine use (59.0% vs. 52.2%; PR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95‐1.18). When restricted to children < 3 years old, JMP‐defined safe disposal was 1.42 times greater (67.5% vs. 46.7%; PR 1.42 95% CI 1.21‐1.67) with higher prevalence of both caregiver safe disposal (34.6% vs. 25.7%; PR 1.44, 95% CI 1.11‐1.86) and child latrine use (32.9% vs. 20.9%; PR 1.41, 95% CI 1.08‐1.83). CONCLUSIONS: The intervention increased JMP‐defined safe disposal, with substantial improvements in both caregiver safe disposal and child latrine use among children < 3 years old. While future research is needed to demonstrate sustainability of these effects, our results suggest a potentially scalable intervention for improving child feces disposal and reducing disease.

In a quantitative stepped‐wedge cluster randomized trial of a community‐based water intervention in rural India, we identified low rates of intervention uptake and reported diarrhea. To better understand and explain these findings, we performed a qualitative study examining barriers and enablers to intervention uptake and health reporting using the COM‐B model, where capabilities, opportunities, and motivators interact to generate behavior. We conducted 20 focus groups and one semi‐structured interview with participants and four focus groups with data collectors. Multifactorial barriers to intervention uptake included distorted perceptions of water‐related health effects, implementation issues that reduced treated water availability; convenience of, and preference for, alternative drinking water sources; delivery of water to plastic storage tanks (perceived as affecting water quality and taste); and resistance to change. Enablers included knowledge of water‐related health risks, proximity to tanks, and social opportunity. Barriers to health reporting included variability in interpretation of illness, suspicion regarding the consequences of reporting disease, weariness with repeated questions, and perceived inaction on health data already provided; low survey implementation fidelity was also important. Enablers included surveyor initiatives to encourage reporting and a sense of social responsibility. This qualitative explanatory study allowed better understanding of our quantitative results.

METHODS: We conducted a trial of water supply infrastructure improvements in Uvira (DRC). Our primary objective was to estimate the relationship between a composite index of water service quality and the monthly number of suspected cholera cases admitted to treatment facilities and, as a secondary analysis, the number of cases confirmed by rapid diagnostic tests. Other exposures included the quantity of supplied water and service continuity. We used Poisson generalised linear models with generalised estimating equations to estimate incidence rate ratios. FINDINGS: Associations between suspected cholera incidence and water service quality (RR 0·86, 95% CI 0·73‐1·01), quantity (RR 0·80, 95% CI 0·62‐1·02) and continuity (RR 0·81, 95% CI 0·77‐0·86) were estimated. The magnitudes of the associations were similar between confirmed cholera incidence and water service quality (RR 0·84, 95% CI 0·73‐0·97), quantity (RR 0·76, 95% CI 0·61‐0·94) and continuity (RR 0·75, 95% CI 0·69‐0·81). These results suggest that an additional 5 L/user/day or 1.2 hour per day of water production could reduce confirmed cholera by 24% (95% CI 6‐39%) and 25% (95% CI 19‐31%), respectively. INTERPRETATION: Ensuring a sufficient and continuous piped water supply may substantially reduce the burden of endemic cholera and diarrhoeal diseases but evaluating this rigorously is challenging.

Recent evidence suggests that the early‐life gut microbiome affects child growth through immune, metabolic and endocrine pathways. Using whole metagenomic sequencing, we map the assembly of the gut microbiome in 335 children from rural Zimbabwe from 1‐18 months of age who were enrolled in the Sanitation, Hygiene, Infant Nutrition Efficacy Trial (SHINE; NCT01824940), a randomized trial of improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and infant and young child feeding (IYCF). Here, we show that the early‐life gut microbiome undergoes programmed assembly that is unresponsive to the randomized interventions intended to improve linear growth. However, maternal HIV infection is associated with over‐diversification and over‐maturity of the early‐life gut microbiome in their uninfected children, in addition to reduced abundance of Bifidobacterium species. Using machine learning models (XGBoost), we show that taxonomic microbiome features are poorly predictive of child growth, however functional metagenomic features, particularly B‐vitamin and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways, moderately predict both attained linear and ponderal growth and growth velocity.

Cholera alone is estimated to cause 95,000 deaths per year, most of which occur in endemic settings with inadequate water access. Whilst a global strategy to eliminate cholera by 2030 calls for investment in improved drinking water services, there is limited rigorous evidence for the impact of improved water supply on endemic cholera transmission in low‐income urban settings. Our protocol is designed to deliver a pragmatic health impact evaluation of a large‐scale water supply intervention in Uvira (Democratic Republic of the Congo), a cholera transmission hotspot. METHODS/DESIGN: A stepped‐wedge cluster randomised trial (SW‐CRT) was designed to evaluate the impact of a large‐scale drinking water supply intervention on cholera incidence among the 280,000 inhabitants of Uvira. The city was divided into 16 clusters, where new community and household taps will be installed following a randomised sequence over a transition period of up to 8 weeks in each cluster. The primary trial outcomes are the monthly incidence of ""confirmed"" cholera cases (patients testing positive by rapid detection kit) and of ""suspected"" cholera cases (patients admitted to the cholera treatment centre). Concurrent process and economic evaluations will provide further information on the context, costs, and efficiency of the intervention. DISCUSSION: In this protocol, we describe a pragmatic approach to conducting rigorous research to assess the impacts of a complex water supply intervention on severe diarrhoeal disease and cholera in an unstable, low‐resource setting representative of cholera‐affected areas. In particular, we discuss a series of pre‐identified risks and linked mitigation strategies as well as the value of combining different data collection methods and preparation of multiple analysis scenarios to account for possible deviations from the protocol. The study described here has the potential to provide robust evidence to support more effective cholera control in challenging, high‐burden settings.

Diseases related to the consumption of contaminated drinking‐water place a major burden on human health. In 2017, 785 million people still lacked access to an improved drinking water source, and these are mostly the poor and marginalised. Almost a quarter of those people rely on surface water that is untreated and over 90% live in rural areas. Many people are forced to rely on sources that are microbiologically unsafe, leading to a higher risk of contracting waterborne diseases, including typhoid, hepatitis A and E, polio and cholera. The objectives of the SAFEWATER project is to develop technologies to provide clean water to economically deprived communities in rural Colombia and Mexico. These water technologies will be tested under real conditions with the cooperation of the rural communities. The SAFEWATER field trials aims to evaluate the health and behaviour impacts of implementing SAFEWATER water treatment technologies for drinking water disinfection, with a behavioral change intervention, within rural communities in Colombia and Mexico The project has three specific objectives: 1. Assess water quality improvement at household level 2. Assess behaviors and test behavioral interventions 3. Assess child growth and related health outcomes Three communities in Colombia and one community in Mexico were recruited to take part in the study. Communities were selected based on factors such as current availability of clean water, accessibility, safety, community size and current activities within the communities. Pilot and feasibility studies were carried out prior to commencing field trials, thus the design of the trials vary across countries. Mexico field trial: The trial in Mexico will use a stepped‐wedge design, randomized at household level over a 12‐month period (6‐12 steps dependent on adherence and feasibility). All households (max n200) willing to be involved will be recruited (separate clinicaltrials.gov registration). Colombia field trial: the trial in Colombia will use a non‐randomized parallel design (2:1; intervention:control). A maximum of 84 households (54:30; intervention:control) will be recruited to take part, with families with young children (<12 years) prioritized. Outcomes for both countries will include 1) water quality, 2) water‐related behaviour (e.g. frequency of system use, uses of treated / raw water), and 3) health, e.g. diarrhoea prevalence, growth (height/weight), school attendance, water insecurity status, gut integrity. Impact: The development and deployment of the SAFEWATER technology has the potential to impact on clean drinking water access for participating communities in Mexico and Colombia and subsequently on the health and wellbeing of those individuals involved.

The Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme reported 1,850 acute diarrhoeal disease outbreaks during 2018 throughout India, of which 19 outbreaks occurred in Bihar [2]. On July 4, 2019, the sub‐divisional hospital in Masaurhi Block, Patna, reported 28 acute diarrhoeal disease cases from Village A. This village has 164 houses with a predominantly underserved population of 1,074 persons. The district medical officer initiated the preliminary investigation, medical treatment, and referral of case‐patients. During July 5‐11, 2019, frontline health workers conducted active case searches in Village A and identified additional cases. On August 7, 2019, the World Health Organization Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer joined the outbreak investigation team to describe the epidemiology, identify risk factors, and recommend evidence‐based prevention and control measures for the outbreak. Methods We defined a diarrhoea case as three or more loose stools in less than 24 hours in Village A resident during June 27‐July 20, 2019. We searched for case‐patients with the above definition by conducting a house‐to‐house survey and reviewed outpatient records of the block sub‐divisional hospital and primary health centre. We conducted an unmatched case‐control study and compared cases with the same number of randomly selected controls for risk factors assuming 90% power, odds ratio (OR) of 3, and 50% exposure among controls using Epi Info software [https://www.cdc.gov/epiinfo]. We included apparently healthy residents during the same period of Village A, Masaurhi Block as controls. We collected information about demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, treatment history, exposure factors (source of drinking water, method of purification, and sanitation) using a semi‐structured questionnaire. We calculated proportions, median age, attack rate, case‐fatality rate, and OR with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk factors. Besides, we collected stool samples from 2 case‐patients for bacteriologic culture, tested water samples collected from government‐supplied tap water for residual chlorine, and observed drainage systems in the affected area. Results We identified 81 case‐patients (68% female) during June 20‐August 11; the median age was 25 years (range 1‐85 years). The overall attack was 7.5% (81/1,074); persons ≥60 years of age had the highest attack rate (10/68, 15%). Four (5%) persons died in 4 different households. Of the four deaths, three (75%) occurred in females; three persons who died were >65 years of age, and three were admitted to a hospital. One died at home without any treatment. Cases were distributed throughout Village A and clustered in four households that each reported more than 1 case. The outbreak began on July 2, 2019, peaked on July 3, 2019, with 28 cases, and rapidly declined after that; the last case was reported on July 12, 2019. In addition to diarrhea, case‐patients reported abdominal pain (57/81, 70%), fever (55/81, 68%), and vomiting (9/81, 11%). Eighty (99%) case‐patients visited health facilities; 34 (41%) visited more than one health facility for treatment. A local nonmedical healer conducted initial diarrhoeal management of 34 (41%) case‐patients, 61 (75%) visited the subdivisional hospital, and 19 (23%) visited private clinics. Among casepatients, 73 (90%) reported using the government tap water supply as their drinking water source, and 30 (37%) boiled water before drinking. In the case‐control study of 81 cases and 81 controls, drinking government‐supplied tap water (OR 16.4 [95% CI 6.9‐38.7]) was associated with illness. Drinking bore well water (OR 0.9 [95% CI 0.026‐0.32), hand‐pumped water (OR 0.1 [95% CI 0.05‐0.3]), and water treated before drinking (OR 0.2 [95% CI 0.1‐0.4]) were protective (Table 1). Laboratory investigation of 2 fecal samples did not detect any pathogenic organism. Testing one water sample did not detect bacteria, and the residual chlorine level was within the permissible limit of 250 mg/dL [3]. We observed a poor drainage system with waterlogging and overflowing that provided potential contamination of water supply pipes. Conclusions In this investigation of an acute diarrhoeal disease outbreak, the illness was probably more likely associated with government‐supplied tap water contamination. We recommended that local health authorities create community awareness through frontline workers to boil water or use filtration methods before drinking government‐supplied tap water. Besides, we recommended that the Masaurhi sub‐district hospital in charge and district administration ensure a regular supply of clean drinking water by regular chlorination, conduct periodic quality checks, and immediately repair the damaged drainage system. Prompt response by the district health authorities in treating case‐patients and decontaminating drinking water sources helped control the outbreak.",15,SUPPL 11,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 635914938,,,,Journal article; Conference proceeding,*Bihar; *acute diarrhea; Abdominal pain; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Attack rate; Awareness; Case control study; Case fatality rate; Child; Chlorination; Conference abstract; Contamination; Demography; Drinking; Epidemic; Female; Fever; Filtration; Government; Health care personnel; Health center; Household; Human; Human tissue; Infant; Intelligence; Loose feces; Major clinical study; Male; Maximum permissible dose; Outpatient; Patient referral; Private hospital; Public hospital; Randomized controlled trial; Resident; Risk assessment; Risk factor; Software; Structured questionnaire; Vomiting; Water supply; Waterlogging; World Health Organization,10.1186/s12919-021-00223-6,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02324345/full,

All the interventions will be applied on a community‐wide basis. Since the purpose of the intervention is to reduce diarrhea, the community would be an appropriate dimension of transmission zone, where humans, vectors, and intermediate hosts are interacting and sharing a common pool of parasites. Of the 1950 communities, 720 communities will be selected for project implementation of clean water supply, and hygiene and sanitation improvement by the selection criteria on the basis of the degree of needs. The 720 communities will be stratified by water and sanitation coverage, accessibility to the main road, and socioeconomic status. Of the 720 communities, 60 will be selected for trial arms. These 60 communities will be stratified into blocks having similar underlying, pre‐intervention, risks of diarrhea. Then they will be randomized within each block by a restricted, stratified randomization process such that 30 comparable communities will each be randomly assigned to either the intervention arm or the control arm.

In this substudy, we leveraged stool samples collected from 130 children 1 year after chlorine doser installation to examine differences between treatment and control children’s gut microbiota. Water chlorination was associated with increased abundance of several bacterial genera previously linked to improved gut health; however, we observed no effects on the overall richness or diversity of taxa. Several clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes were relatively more abundant in the gut microbiome of treatment children, possibly due to increases in Enterobacteriaceae.

Previous studies have identified lack ofcaregiver hand washing with soap and treatment of household drinking water, poor waterstorage practices, and lack of caregiver knowledge of diarrhea prevention as importantrisk factors for diarrheal disease in pediatric populations. Water, sanitation, andhygiene (WASH) interventions promoting household chlorination of drinking water and handwashing with soap have the potential to reduce diarrheal disease incidence in childrenless than five years of age an estimated 30 to 40%. However, there has been limitedsuccess in encouraging households to sustain these behaviors over time. Furthermore,community‐based WASH interventions are expensive and often difficult to implement in anurban context in low resource settings.Previous studies have found that at the time of a severe illness such as choleraoutbreaks, households have higher perceived severity and benefits of water treatment. InMadagascar an intervention which promoted the use of chlorine and 20 liter jerry cansreached peak sales during the high season for cholera. Consistent findings were observedin Zambia where sales of a water treatment product called Clorin significantly increasedduring a cholera epidemic. Furthermore in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the use of a community levelpoint of use chlorine dispenser peaked after cholera deaths in a slum area of the city.Therefore admission at a health care facility for the treatment of severe diarrhea couldpotentially serve as an ideal opportunity to promote WASH interventions on improved watertreatment and hygiene practicesThe research team developed a Hospital Based WASH intervention which is entitled CHoBI7(Cholera Hospital‐Based Intervention for 7 days). Chobi means ""picture"" in Bangla for thepictorial WASH module delivered as part of the program. The CHoBI7 intervention wasinitially designed to reduce cholera infection among family members of hospitalizedcholera cases during the one week high risk period after the case presents at thehospital. This Hospital Based WASH intervention is disseminated by health facility basedpromoters to hospitalized diarrhea patients and the family members and includes: (1) Apictorial module on diarrhea transmission and prevention, and (2) A diarrhea preventionpackage which contains chlorine tablets for water treatment, a soapy water bottle and ahand washing station, and a sealed water vessel to ensure safe water storage. Thefindings from previous recent randomized controlled trials of The Cholera Hospital BasedIntervention for 7 Days (CHoBI7) demonstrated that this intervention was effective insignificantly reducing symptomatic cholera infections, and had significant sustainedimpacts on hand washing with soap behaviors and improved water quality 12 months postintervention.In an effort to build evidence to take the CHoBI7 intervention to scale in Bangladesh,the investigators partnered with the Bangladesh Ministry of Health and Family Welfare(MoHFW) to develop and evaluate scalable approaches for CHoBI7 intervention delivery. TheCHoBI7 intervention was broaden during this time to include diarrhea patients of alletiology not just cholera. In addition, the investigators developed the CHoBI7 WASHmobile health (mHealth) program, to serve as a low cost scalable approach to reinforcethe CHoBI7 WASH pictorial module delivered in the health facility without the need forhome visits. After health facility delivery of the CHoBI7 pictorial module by a healthworker, diarrhea patient households receive weekly voice and text messages from theCHoBI7 mHealth program over a 12 month period. The CHoBI7 WASH mHealth programsignificantly decreased diarrhea and stunting among young children, and lead to sustainedhandwashing with soap practices and improved stored drinking water quality during the 12month surveillance period in an urban setting in Dhaka, Bangladesh during theinvestigators recent randomized controlled trial.The investigators goal for this study is to develop a scalable version of the CHoBI7program that can be delivered in district hospitals and sub‐district health complexes inrural and urban Bangladesh.

There are 13 endemic states and 78 cholera hotspots districts [2]. Contamination of drinking water, poor sanitation and flooding are among known risk factors for cholera outbreaks [3]. Maharashtra is an endemic state and had recent cholera outbreaks in 2016 and 2018 [4]. In October 2019, Sangli, Maharashtra, reported sudden rise in acute watery diarrhea (AWD) cases from Shivajinagar village to the central unit, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme. Sangli, a cholera hotspot district, was declared open defecation free in 2017 under countrywide Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) [5]. Shivajinagar had population of 2,563 and was served by sub‐centre, Vihapur (3km), primary health centre (PHC) Nevari (30km) and rural hospital (RH) Kadegaon (2km). Epidemic Intelligence Service officers from National Centre for Disease Control were deployed to conduct an epidemiological investigation of the outbreak. We present time, place and person distribution of cases, associated risk factors and recommendations for outbreak control and prevention. Methods For case search, suspect cholera was defined as ≥3 watery stools in 24hr duration (AWD) in a Shivajinagar resident (age ≥2year) from October 12 to November 8, 2019. Confirmed cholera was culturepositive stool of suspect case for V. cholerae. A line‐list of cases was prepared through house‐to‐house search and from RH in‐patient records on symptoms, treatment and toilet availability. We conducted an unmatched case‐control study (1:1). We calculated sample size 80 assuming odds ratio (OR) 4, 40% exposure in controls, 95% confidence interval (CI) and 80% power. Cases were selected randomly from the line‐list. Controls were Shivajinagar residents (age ≥2year) without AWD selected randomly from case‐free households using village household registers. Data on socio‐demography, exposures (suspected AWD case, mass gathering events), treatment‐seeking, household sanitation, and hygiene practices was collected from all participants with Epicollect5 software and analysed using STATAv.15. We conducted descriptive statistics and applied chi‐square, OR, and logistic regression for confounding and inference. Stool samples were collected on October 23‐24 and sent for culture, sensitivity and serotyping at government medical college, Miraj. Public and private wells were tested for faecal contamination on October 23 and 30, and residual chlorine on November 8. A common well, main village water source, was surveyed and water supply maintenance records were sought for September‐October, 2019. Results We identified 131 cholera cases (96% suspect, 4% confirmed) with median age 40years (range:2‐86), 76 (56%) females and 5% (131/ 2,563) attack rate. Ninety‐eight (75%) were hospitalized and case fatality was 2.3% (3/131). Cases were reported between October 13 and November 1, 2019 with a peak (30 cases) on 23 October. Among 40 cases interviewed, symptoms reported were abdominal pain (56%), vomiting (51%) and fever (23%). Twenty‐one (53%) cases sought treatment on the day of illness. Primarily, 18 (43%) cases were treated at a village health camp while 12 (33%) and 8 (20%) were treated at RH and nearby private facilities, respectively. Subsequently, twenty‐seven cases visited another health facility‐12 (44%) private, 11 (41%) RH and 4 (15%) visited the health camp. Notably, no patient visited PHC Nevari reportedly due to distance. Thirty‐seven (93%) cases received antibiotics and 36 (90%) received rehydration therapy. Cases (40) and controls (40) were similar demographically except for education (<5th standard, p value=0.02) and occupation (farmer and labourer, p value=0.02). Greater odds of AWD were associated with drinking water supplied from the common well (OR:47.6, 95% CI:6.4‐ 2015.6). These odds grew (OR:69.5, 95% CI:7.13‐658) after adjusting for age, education and gender. On subset analysis, odds of receiving drinking water through old pipeline system compared with others (new pipeline and private sources) were 16 times higher among cases compared to controls (OR=16.33, 95%CI=4.68‐64). Exposure to common food or water source during a local mass gathering event (assembly election on October 21) was found not significant. Among case‐control study participants, handwashing practices with soap and water before cooking (OR=2.6, 95%CI=0.54‐16.75), household water treatment (OR=1.3 95%CI=0.42‐4.12) and safe drinking water retrieval practices (OR=4.6, 95%CI=0.41‐234) were reported low. Additionally, among 14 households that treated drinking water, process of chlorination 7 (50%) and boiling 2 (14%) were found inadequate for water purification. Of 80, seven households (9%) did not own a toilet (OR=1.4, 95%CI=0.21‐9.97) and used other's or in one case practiced open defecation. And, 44 (56%) households did not have soap in handwashing area (OR=1.3, 95%CI=0.48‐3.48) when surveyed. Five of nine stool samples cultured positive for V. cholerae, El Tor O1, Ogawa. The common well water was found contaminated (>16 Coliforms/ 100ml) on October 23 and potable on October 30. Three private wells were found potable both times. The common well was found uncovered and situated on sloping terrain. Waste water drainage from upstream communities flowed within 1meter of it and drained downhill into a stream. This area was reportedly waterlogged due to heavy rains on October 18‐20, 2019. Routinely, well water was pumped into overhead water tanks, chlorinated manually and distributed in the village through old and new pipeline systems established in 1982 and 2018, respectively. Routine chlorination was reported irregular however, records of it and other maintenance activities were not available. Conclusion Shivajinagar village in Sangli, Maharashtra witnessed laboratory confirmed outbreak of El Tor V. cholerae (Ogawa) likely due to supply of contaminated drinking water. Local authorities‐initiated control measures on October 22 after two deaths. It included arranging alternate water supply following stoppage of the regular one, a health camp, active case search and health promotion activities. We report limitations due to recall bias in participants, absent water testing for cholera, and possible inclusion of baseline diarrhea cases as only nine cases were tested for cholera. We recommended health education on handwashing, household water treatment, safe storage, and promoting temporary latrines as short‐term control measures. In long term, we recommended to ensure routine water chlorination, testing and their record keeping, to continue health education, and to construct toilets under SBM after needs assessment. Replacement of old pipeline and improvement of common well surroundings were advised. Better coordination between serving government health facilities was recommended for early detection of case surge considering low utilization of PHC.",15,SUPPL 11,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 635914922,,,,Journal article; Conference proceeding,*Maharashtra; *cholera; Abdominal pain; Adult; Adverse drug reaction; Agricultural worker; Attack rate; Building; Case control study; Case fatality rate; Chlorination; Coliform bacterium; Conference abstract; Contamination; Controlled study; Cooking; Defecation; Demography; Diarrhea; Disease control; Election; Epidemic; Female; Fever; Flooding; Gender; Government; Hand washing; Health center; Health promotion; Hospital patient; Household; Human; Human cell; Information retrieval; Intelligence; Liquid feces; Major clinical study; Male; Medical record; Medical school; Needs assessment; Nonhuman; Occupation; Pipeline; Randomized controlled trial; Recall bias; Rehydration; Resident; Risk factor; Rural hospital; Sample size; Sanitation; Serotyping; Side effect; Software; Vomiting; Wastewater; Water supply; Water treatment,10.1186/s12919-021-00223-6,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02324344/full,

We implemented an integrated home‐environmental intervention package (IHIP), comprising a kitchen sink, hygiene education and a certified improved biomass cookstove, and an early child development (ECD) programme to improve children´s health and developmental outcomes in the rural high‐altitude Andes of Peru. METHODS: We conducted a one‐year cluster‐randomised controlled trial among 317 children < 36 months divided into 4 arms (IHIP + ECD, IHIP, ECD, and Control) and 40 clusters (10 clusters per arm). ECD status (socio‐emotional, fine and gross motor, communication, cognitive skills, and an overall performance) measured with the Peruvian Infant Development Scale and the occurrence of self‐reported child diarrhoea from caretakers were primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of acute respiratory infections and the presence of thermo‐tolerant faecal bacteria in drinking water. The trial was powered to compare each intervention against its control arm but it did not allow pairwise comparisons among the four arms. Primary analysis followed the intention‐to‐treat principle. For the statistical analysis, we employed generalised estimating equation models with robust standard errors and an independent correlation structure. RESULTS: We obtained ECD information from 101 children who received the ECD intervention (individually and combined with IHIP) and 102 controls. Children who received the ECD intervention performed better in all the domains compared to controls. We found differences in the overall performance (64 vs. 39%, odd ratio (OR): 2.8; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6‐4.9) and the cognitive domain (62 vs 46%, OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.1‐3.5). Data analysis of child morbidity included 154 children who received the IHIP intervention (individually and combined with ECD) and 156 controls. We recorded 110,666 child‐days of information on diarrhoea morbidity and observed 1.3 mean episodes per child‐year in the children who received the IHIP intervention and 1.1 episodes in the controls. This corresponded to an incidence risk ratio of 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8‐1.7). CONCLUSIONS: Child stimulation improved developmental status in children, but there was no health benefit associated with the home‐environmental intervention. Limited year‐round access to running water at home and the possible contamination of drinking water after boiling were two potential factors linked to the lack of effect of the home‐environmental intervention. Potential interactions between ECD and home‐environmental interventions need to be further investigated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN‐26548981.

Although the incidence of these illnesses can be reduced through improved water quality and the introduction of sanitation and hygiene programs in schools, there is limited evidence to demonstrate the impact of interventions in schools in Ethiopia. The purpose of this study was to compare the prevalence and associated factors of diarrheal diseases in school‐aged children between schools in Habru District, north‐eastern Ethiopia that adopted water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions and those that did not. METHODS: A comparative cross‐sectional study was conducted among 640 randomly selected school children (160 from schools that adopted WASH interventions and 480 from schools that did not). Trained data collectors used a pre‐tested structured questionnaire and an observational checklist to collect the data. Descriptive statistics, such as frequencies and percentages, were computed to present the prevalence of diarrheal disease. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with diarrheal disease. RESULTS: The overall 2‐week prevalence of diarrhea among school children was 30.5%. In WASH‐implementing schools, the prevalence was 21.9%, significantly lower than in non‐WASH‐implementing schools (33.3%). In non‐WASH‐implementing schools, the odds of diarrheal diseases among students were significantly decreased in those students who used a clean school latrine, self‐reported latrine utilization at home and were aware of the causes of diarrhea. Similarly, among students in WASH‐implementing schools, self‐reported latrine utilization at home, personal hygiene inspection and awareness of the causes of diarrhea were factors associated with decreasing odds of diarrhea occurrence. CONCLUSION: This study identified a high prevalence of a diarrheal disease among children in schools with no WASH interventions compared with schools that do have WASH interventions.

The investigators study in Bangladesh found thatindividuals living within 50 meters of a cholera patient were at 30 times higher risk ofdeveloping cholera than the general population during the first week after the indexpatient sought care at a health facility. However, there has been little work done todevelop and evaluate interventions for this high risk population.Objective: The investigators objective is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of acase area targeted WASH intervention in reducing cholera infections and increasingsustained WASH behaviors in transmission hotspots in a ring around cholera cases.Previous studies: The investigators research group developed theCholera‐Hospital‐Based‐Intervention‐for‐7‐Days (CHoBI7), a WASH intervention delivered tocholera patients and the participants household members in a health facility. theinvestigators randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Bangladesh of CHoBI7 demonstrated thisintervention was effective in significantly reducing cholera, and led to sustainedincreases in handwashing with soap and improved drinking water quality 12 monthspost‐intervention in cholera patient households. This intervention, however, solelyfocused on cholera patients households. There are no studies to date that have evaluatedthe impact on reducing cholera of delivering a ring WASH intervention to householdsliving near cholera patients.Design and Setting: The Director of Disease Control at the Bangladesh Ministry of Healthand Family Welfare would like to take CHoBI7 to scale across Bangladesh, and hasrequested the investigators build evidence on scalable approaches for delivering CHoBI7as a CATI in a ring around cholera patient households. This study will have 3 phases.During the formative research and planning phase the investigators will develop ascalable, theory and evidence based ring WASH intervention through in‐depth interviews,focus group discussions, workshops, and a pilot. During the intervention implementationand evaluation phase the investigators will conduct a RCT to prospectively follow 3120participants from 1040 households living in 40 rings around cholera cases to evaluate theeffectiveness of the intervention in: (1) reducing cholera infections during the firstweek after the index patient in the ring seeks care at a health facility; and (2)increasing handwashing with soap and stored water quality over a 12 month period. Thefirst arm will receive the standard recommendation given in Bangladesh during diarrheaoutbreaks on oral rehydration solution use and a leaflet on WASH practices during asingle visit.

METHODS: Through a controlled intervention study, we tested faecal and water samples collected from both the intervention and control sites before and after the interventions using microbiological, immunological and molecular assays to determine the prevalence of diarrhoeagenic agents and microbial quality of water. Data from the hospital registers were used to estimate all‐cause diarrhoea prevalence. RESULTS: After the interventions, we observed a 58.2% (95% CI: 39.4‐75.3) decline in all‐cause diarrhoea in the intervention site versus a 22.2% (95% CI: 5.9‐49.4) reduction of the same in the control site. Besides rotavirus and pathogenic Escherichia coli, the rate of isolation of other diarrhoea‐causing bacteria declined substantially in the intervention site. The microbial quality of community and household water improved considerably in both the intervention (81.9%; 95% CI: 74.5%‐87.8%) and control (72.5%; 95% CI: 64.2%‐80.5%) sites with the relative improvements in the intervention site being slightly larger. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated WASH, MNCH, nutrition and ECD interventions resulted in notable decline in all‐cause diarrhoea and improvements in water quality in the rural resource‐limited population in Kenya.

This study identified the determinants of RVV immunogenicity among infants in rural Zimbabwe. Methods: Anti‐rotavirus IgA titres were measured among a sub‐group of infants enrolled in the Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trial (NCT01824940). SHINE was a cluster‐randomized trial of improved infant and young child feeding, and improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in two rural Zimbabwean districts. Infants received RVV as part of the national immunisation programme. Among HIV‐unexposed infants in the non‐WASH trial arms, we evaluated associations between potential risk factors (vaccine schedule and dose, maternal and infant nutritional status, infant diarrhoea, and household environment) and RVV immunogenicity (seroconversion, seropositivity and geometric mean titres) using multivariable regression. Results: Among 219 infants with seroconversion data, 43 (20%) successfully seroconverted and 176 (80%) failed to seroconvert to RVV. Seroconversion was positively associated with a higher length‐for‐age Z‐score (LAZ) around the time of vaccination (adjusted RR 1.27 (95% CI 1.04, 1.55), P = 0.021), and negatively associated with concurrent OPV and RVV administration (adjusted RR 0.36 (0.19, 0.71), P = 0.003). Among 472 infants with post‐vaccination titres, a higher LAZ score was associated with increased seropositivity (aRR 1.21 (95% CI 1.06, 1.38), P = 0.004), and higher birthweight was associated with increased IgA titres (0.45 (95%CI 0.18, 1.09) U/mL greater per 100 g gain in birthweight; P = 0.001).

Inadequate MHM has been associated with urogenital infections. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a combined household‐level piped water and sanitation intervention on MHM practices and urogenital infection symptoms (UGS) among women living in rural communities of Odisha (India). This study was nested within a pair‐matched cohort study designed to assess impact of the Gram Vikas MANTRA program, which provided household‐level piped water, bathing areas and latrine to all households in intervention villages, on diarrheal disease (primary outcome). The program did not specifically promote menstrual hygiene practices. Forty‐five intervention villages were randomly selected from a list of those where implementation was previously completed at least five years before and matched to 45 control villages. Data for the main study was collected in four rounds from June 2015 to October 2016. For the MHM sub study, household surveys were administered in round four to randomly selected women aged 18 or older among study households from the 90 villages, to assess self‐reported MHM practicesand urogenital infections symptoms. MHM practices were deemed adequate if they met some of the criteria developed on the basis of international monitoring that the GV program could modify (adequate frequency of absorbent change, washing the body with soap and privacy for managing menstruation). Multilevel mixed‐effects logistic regression with a random effect distribution at the level of the pair and village was used to estimate the effect of the intervention on adequate MHM practices (primary outcome) and reported UGS (secondary outcome). A total of 1045 women (517 from intervention and 528 from control) were included in the study. Women who lived in the villages receiving the intervention, were more likely to report adequate MHM practices than those in control villages (Adjusted OR (AOR) 3.54, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.86‐6.78). 14.51% and 15.53% of women living in the control and intervention villages reported having at least one UGS. There was no evidence of an intervention effect on reported UGS (AOR = 0.97, 95%CI: 0.64‐1.46). While household latrines or bathing areas with access to piped water improve the environment that enable MHM practices related to privacy, the provision of such facilities alone had only a moderate impact in adequate MHM and did not have an effect on self‐reported UGS.

The WASH Benefits Bangladesh trial implemented a multicomponent sanitation intervention that led to a 39% reduction in the prevalence of diarrhea among children and a 25% reduction for ARI, measured 1 to 2 years after intervention implementation. We measured longer‐term intervention effects on these outcomes between 1 to 3.5 years after intervention implementation, including periods with differing intensity of behavioral promotion. METHODS AND FINDINGS: WASH Benefits Bangladesh was a cluster‐randomized controlled trial of water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition interventions (NCT01590095). The sanitation intervention included provision of or upgrades to improved latrines, sani‐scoops for feces removal, children's potties, and in‐person behavioral promotion. Promotion was intensive up to 2 years after intervention initiation, decreased in intensity between years 2 to 3, and stopped after 3 years. Access to and reported use of latrines was high in both arms, and latrine quality was significantly improved by the intervention, while use of child feces management tools was low. We enrolled a random subset of households from the sanitation and control arms into a longitudinal substudy, which measured child health with quarterly visits between 1 to 3.5 years after intervention implementation. The study period therefore included approximately 1 year of high‐intensity promotion, 1 year of low‐intensity promotion, and 6 months with no promotion. We assessed intervention effects on diarrhea and ARI prevalence among children <5 years through intention‐to‐treat analysis using generalized linear models with robust standard errors. Masking was not possible during data collection, but data analysis was masked. We enrolled 720 households (360 per arm) from the parent trial and made 9,800 child observations between June 2014 and December 2016. Over the entire study period, diarrheal prevalence was lower among children in the sanitation arm (11.9%) compared to the control arm (14.5%) (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.81, 95% CI 0.66, 1.00, p = 0.05; prevalence difference [PD] = ‐0.027, 95% CI ‐0.053, 0, p = 0.05). ARI prevalence did not differ between sanitation (21.3%) and control (22.7%) arms (PR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.82, 1.05, p = 0.23; PD = ‐0.016, 95% CI ‐0.043, 0.010, p = 0.23). There were no significant differences in intervention effects between periods with high‐intensity versus low‐intensity/no promotion. Study limitations include use of caregiver‐reported symptoms to define health outcomes and limited data collected after promotion ceased. CONCLUSIONS: The observed effect of the WASH Benefits Bangladesh sanitation intervention on diarrhea in children appeared to be sustained for at least 3.5 years after implementation, including 1.5 years after heavy promotion ceased. Existing latrine access was high in the study setting, suggesting that improving on‐site latrine quality can deliver health benefits when latrine use practices are in place. Further work is needed to understand how latrine adoption can be achieved and sustained in settings with low existing access and how sanitation programs can adopt transformative approaches of excreta management, including safe disposal of child and animal feces, to generate a hygienic home environment.

Here we provide support for the hypothesis that agricultural development and fertilizer use in West Africa increase the burden of the parasitic disease schistosomiasis by fuelling the growth of submerged aquatic vegetation that chokes out water access points and serves as habitat for freshwater snails that transmit Schistosoma parasites to more than 200 million people globally8‐10. In a cluster randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03187366) in which we removed invasive submerged vegetation from water points at 8 of 16 villages (that is, clusters), control sites had 1.46 times higher intestinal Schistosoma infection rates in schoolchildren and lower open water access than removal sites. Vegetation removal did not have any detectable long‐term adverse effects on local water quality or freshwater biodiversity. In feeding trials, the removed vegetation was as effective as traditional livestock feed but 41 to 179 times cheaper and converting the vegetation to compost provided private crop production and total (public health plus crop production benefits) benefit‐to‐cost ratios as high as 4.0 and 8.8, respectively. Thus, the approach yielded an economic incentive‐with important public health co‐benefits‐to maintain cleared waterways and return nutrients captured in aquatic plants back to agriculture with promise of breaking poverty‐disease traps. To facilitate targeting and scaling of the intervention, we lay the foundation for using remote sensing technology to detect snail habitats.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether bacterial load in drinking water is associated with altered risk of allergic diseases. METHODS: We recruited 1,110 schoolchildren aged 6‐16 years between 2011 and 2013 in Požega‐Slavonia County in Croatia, where we capitalized on a natural experiment whereby individuals receive drinking water through public mains supply or individual wells. We obtained data on microbial content of drinking water for all participants; 585 children were randomly selected for more detailed assessments, including skin prick testing. Since water supply was highly correlated with rural residence, we compared clinical outcomes across four groups (Rural/Individual, Rural/Public, Urban/Individual and Urban/Public). For each child, we derived quantitative index of microbial exposure (bacterial load in the drinking water measured during the child's first year of life). RESULTS: Cumulative bacterial load in drinking water was higher (median [IQR]: 6390 [4190‐9550] vs 0 [0‐0]; P < .0001), and lifetime prevalence of allergic diseases was significantly lower among children with individual supply (5.5% vs 2.3%, P = .01; 14.4% vs 6.7%, P < .001; 25.2% vs 15.1%, P < .001; asthma, atopic dermatitis [AD] and rhinitis, respectively).

A prospective cohort study with 4 years of follow-up in Mirpur, Bangladesh",BMJ open,2022,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between existing household water quality, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices and severe cholera risk in a dense urban slum where cholera is highly endemic. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We assembled a large prospective cohort within a cluster randomised trial evaluating the effectiveness of oral cholera vaccine. Our dynamic cohort population (n=193 576) comprised individuals living in the 'non‐intervention' clusters of the trial, and were followed over 4 years. This study was conducted in a dense urban slum community of Dhaka, Bangladesh and cholera surveillance was undertaken in 12 hospitals serving the study area. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: First severe cholera episode detected during follow‐up period. METHODS: We applied a machine learning algorithm on a training subpopulation (n=96 943) to develop a binary ('better', 'not better') composite WASH variable predictive of severe cholera. The WASH rule was evaluated for performance in a separate validation subpopulation (n=96 633). Afterwards, we used Cox regression models to evaluate the association between 'better' WASH households and severe cholera risk over 4 years in the entire study population. RESULTS: The 'better' WASH rule found that water quality and access were the most significant factors associated with severe cholera risk. Members of 'better' WASH households, constituting one‐third of the population, had a 47% reduced risk of severe cholera (95% CI: 29 to 69; p<0.001), after adjusting for covariates. The protective association between living in a 'better' WASH household and severe cholera persisted in all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Salutary existing household WASH practices were associated with a significantly reduced long‐term risk of severe cholera in an urban slum of Dhaka. These findings suggest that WASH adaptations already practised in the community may be important for developing and implementing effective and sustainable cholera control programmes in similar settings.

As such, they are termed prolonged diarrhoea, and are associated with over two‐thirds of all diarrhoeal deaths. Due to a lack of robust data, we aimed to evaluate a comparative background characteristics of young children with acute and prolonged diarrhoea, and their outcomes at day 90 follow‐up. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of data from the Antibiotics for Children with Diarrhea (ABCD) trial. Children aged 2‐23 months were enrolled between July 2017 and July 2019 from seven Asian and sub‐Saharan African countries. For this analysis, we divide diarrhoea into two categories: acute diarrhoea (duration <7 days) and prolonged diarrhoea (duration ≥7‐13 days). We used logistic regression to observe baseline crude and adjusted associations and linear regression to compare post‐discharge outcomes. Results: We analysed data on 8266 children, of whom 756 (9%) had prolonged diarrhoea and 7510 (91%) had acute diarrhoea. Pakistan had the highest proportion of children with prolonged diarrhoea (n/N = 178/1132, 16%), while Tanzania had the lowest (n/N = 12/1200, 1%). From an analysis that adjusted for sex, breastfeeding, nutritional status, clinical presentation, housing, water supply, sanitation, and country, we observed that presentation at a health facility with prolonged diarrhoea was associated with low age (2‐12 months) (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02, 1.53; P = 0.028), presence of three or more under‐five children in the family (aOR = 1.54; 95% CI = 1.26, 1.87; P < 0.001), maternal illiteracy (aOR = 1.45; 95% CI = 1.21, 1.74, P < 0.001), moderate underweight (aOR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.01, 1.55; P = 0.042) and pathogen (Campylobacter) (aOR = 1.27; 95% CI = 1.12, 1.44; P < 0.001). At day 90 follow‐up, children with prolonged diarrhoea had significantly lower weight‐for‐age z‐score compared to children with acute diarrhoea (‐1.62, standard deviation (SD) = 1.11 vs ‐1.52, SD = 1.20; P = 0.032), as well as significantly higher frequency of hospital admission (6.1% vs 4.5%; P = 0.042). Conclusions: Prolonged diarrhoea was more common in children of younger age, those who were moderately underweight, those with Campylobacter in stool, those with three or more under‐five children in a family, and those with illiterate mothers compared to those who had acute diarrhoea. Children with prolonged diarrhoea more often required hospitalisation during the three‐month follow‐up period compared to their counterparts.",14,,04196,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 39388679,,,,,Journal article,"*Anti‐Bacterial Agents [therapeutic use]; Africa South of the Sahara [epidemiology]; Asia [epidemiology]; Diarrhea [drug therapy, epidemiology]; Diarrhea, Infantile [drug therapy]; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",10.7189/jogh.14.04196,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02760445/full,

Yet, in many low‐ and middle‐income countries households with a latrine often fail to safely dispose of their child's feces into the latrine. We conducted a cluster randomized trial (CRT) in 74 villages in rural Odisha, India to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention aimed at improving caregiver safe disposal of child feces and child latrine use. The intervention was designed based on behavior change theory and novel CFM hardware was co‐developed with caregivers following a user‐centered design approach. The resultant CFM intervention consisted of six behavior change strategies together with provision of hardware: wash basin and bucket with lid to aid safe management of soiled nappies and a novel latrine training mat to aid safe disposal and latrine training. All households with a latrine and a child <5 years old were eligible. Following a baseline survey, 37 villages were randomly allocated to intervention arm and 37 to control arm. A community‐based organization delivered the intervention and an endline survey was carried out four to six months after delivery among all eligible households. The primary outcome was safe disposal of child feces after last defecation as defined by the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), which encompasses two sub‐behaviors: caregiver disposal of the child's feces into a latrine and the child using the latrine. Analysis included 662 caregivers (841 children) in the intervention arm and 631 caregivers (785 children) in control arm. We found the prevalence of JMP‐defined safe disposal at endline was 1.15 times greater (95% CI 1.03 ‐ 1.29) in the intervention arm compared to control. We separately examined the sub‐behaviors and found the prevalence of caregiver disposal in latrine at endline was 1.76 times greater (95% CI 1.33 ‐ 2.33) in the intervention arm compared to control but there was no difference observed in prevalence of child latrine use at endline (PR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 ‐ 1.17).

However, it is not clear when such programs can be discontinued and there are concerns about the sustainability of current STH control programs. The DeWorm3 project is a large multi‐country community cluster randomized trial in Benin, India and Malawi designed to determine the feasibility of interrupting the transmission of STH using community‐wide delivery of mass drug administration (MDA) with anthelmintics over multiple rounds. Here, we present baseline data and estimate key epidemiological parameters important in determining the likelihood of transmission interruption in the DeWorm3 trial. A baseline census was conducted in October‐December 2017 in India, November‐December 2017 in Malawi and in January‐February 2018 in Benin. The baseline census enumerated all members of each household and collected demographic data and information on occupation, assets, and access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Each study site was divided into 40 clusters of at least 1,650 individuals per cluster. Clusters were randomized to receive twice yearly community‐wide MDA with albendazole (GSK) targeting eligible individuals of all ages (20 clusters), or to receive the standard‐of‐care deworming program targeting children provided in each country. In each site, a randomly selected group of 150 individuals per cluster (6,000 total per site) was selected from the baseline census using stratified random sampling, and each individual provided a single stool sample for analysis of STH infection using the Kato‐Katz technique. Study site, household and individual characteristics were summarized as appropriate. We estimated key epidemiological parameters including the force of infection and the degree of parasite aggregation within the population. The DeWorm3 sites range in population from 94,969 to 140,932. The population age distribution varied significantly by site, with the highest proportion of infants and young children in Malawi and the highest proportion of adults in India. The baseline age‐ and cluster‐weighted prevalence, as measured by Kato‐Katz, varied across sites and by species, Baseline hookworm prevalence in India was 21.4% (95% CI: 20.4‐22.4%), while prevalence of Ascaris and Trichuris by Kato‐Katz was low (0.1% and 0.3% overall). In Malawi, the overall age‐ and cluster‐weighted STH prevalence was 7.7% (95% CI: 7.1‐8.4%) predominantly driven by hookworm infections (7.4%) while Ascaris (0.1%) and Trichuris (0.3%) infections were rare. In Benin, the overall age‐ and cluster‐weighted prevalence was significantly lower (5.6%, 95% CI: 5.1‐6.2%) and Ascaris (2.0%, 95% CI: 1.6‐2.3%) was more common than in other sites. Ascaris infections were more likely to be moderate‐ or heavy‐intensity (43.7%, unweighted) compared to hookworm (5.0%). The force of infection for hookworm was highest in adults in India and Malawi but appeared relatively stable across age groups in Benin. These data demonstrate the significant variability between the sites in terms of demography, socio‐economic status and environmental characteristics. In addition, the baseline prevalence and intensity data from DeWorm3 suggest that each site has unique epidemiologic characteristics that will be critical in determining correlates of achieving STH transmission interruption in the DeWorm3 trial.

This paper presents specific results on knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of a cluster‐randomized controlled trial to reduce diarrheal disease and dengue entomological risk factors in rural primary schools in Colombia. The aim was to investigate whether enhanced educational interventions on dengue and diarrheal disease in schools could improve KAP scores related to these diseases in students and teachers in rural primary schools, as well as the students' parents. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A factorial cluster‐randomized controlled trial was carried out in 35 rural primary schools in two municipalities in Cundinamarca, central Colombia. Schools were randomized into four arms: interventions related to diarrheal disease (DIA), dengue (DEN), both (DIADEN), or no interventions (control, CON). Both educational and physical interventions to reduce risk factors of dengue and diarrhea were implemented. Comprehensive teachers' manuals were developed and deployed to guide the learning activities. The intervention was carried out over two school years. The knowledge scores of students receiving dengue interventions (DEN, DIADEN) increased by 1.16 point score (0.75‐1.56, p<0.001) and those receiving diarrhea interventions (DIA, DIADEN) increased by 1.15 point score (0.67‐1.63, p<0.001). The attitude and practice scores of students receiving the diarrhea interventions increased (Attitudes: 0.41 [0.11‐0.71, p = 0.01]; Practices: 0.33 [0.01‐0.65, p = 0.042]), but not for those receiving the dengue interventions (p = 0.31 and p = 0.08, respectively). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: There were increases in knowledge scores among students, their teachers and their parents for both diseases. However, the attitudes and practices components were not affected to the same extent.

Prior to this study, a group of schools in the study's target areas were surveyedby the Tdh (in Nigeria) and Cesvi (in Palestine) using the Facility Evaluation Tool forWASH in Schools (FACET WINS) which is a monitoring tool for WASH delivery services inschools. From these schools a subsample was identified which fulfils certain inclusioncriteria (see Eligibility). This subsample was handed over to the local Tdh and Cesvicollaborators who carefully assessed the security situation around the schools. The Tdhand Cesvi collaborators then selected 26 facilities per country, which are most probableto still be accessible for data collection within the next year. These 26 schools willthen be allocated to the two arms (intervention vs. control) with covariate constrainedstratified randomization using computer‐generated randomization code provided by astatistician not involved in any field activities. The intervention arm will receive thefull intervention package (see multi‐component intervention in primary schools). Thecontrol arm will receive nothing for the duration of the intervention (12 months).Afterwards, they will receive the same intervention package with potential improvementsidentified in the former intervention group.Objectives of the study: ‐ Primary objective: Evaluate the effects of the H4H multi‐component intervention onhand hygiene of primary school students in Nigeria and Palestine. ‐ Secondary objectives: ‐ Evaluate the effects of the H4H multi‐component on the well‐being of primary school students in Nigeria and Palestine ‐ Assess the effect of the H4H multi‐component package on hygiene‐related risks, attitudes, norms, abilities and self‐regulation (RANAS) behavioural factors of primary school students ‐ Explore the associations of personal, physical and social contextual factors with hand hygiene and the well‐being of primary school students in Palestine ‐ Explore the perceived impacts of the H4H multi‐component package on the health and well‐being of primary school students ‐ Explorative object: Assess the effect of the H4H multi‐component package onhygiene‐related health outcomes and absenteeism incidence of primary school studentsin Nigeria and Palestine.In the schools, the investigators selected 50 eligible students from each school from oneor two classes within the age group of 10‐12 years using random sampling. If a school hada single class consisting of ≥ 50 students within the study's target age group, theinvestigators selected the sample from that class. However, if no class with the targetage group had more than 50 students, the investigators randomly selected two classes fromwithin the target age group and selected the sample from these classes. For differentdata collection modules, the investigators randomly selected subsets from the 50previously selected students.The modules of the study incudes qualitative and quantitative data approaches in order toenable a triangulation of the overall project results. The following modules will be usedin the cRCT and the overall project: (i) Module 1: Combined RANAS and well‐being survey,(ii) Module 2: Structured handwashing observations, (iii) Module 3: Microbiologicalanalysis of hand rinse samples, (iv) Module 4: Diary approach for health outcomes andabsenteeism, (v) Module 5: personal, physical and social contextual factors survey (vi)Module 6: Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and (vii) Module 7: Key informant interviews(KIIs)..Local collaborators from Tdh and Cesvi and the regional Ministries of Education (MoE)were involved from the study's kick‐off meeting onwards and are regularly being consultedin bi‐weekly meetings and additional ToC workshops led by Skat Foundation. The datacollection methods for each module will be described in further detail:(i) Module 1: Combined RANAS and well‐being survey: The survey will be developed throughRANAS approach that targets the underlying psychological factors that are postulated asimportant precursors for effective behaviour change by the model. These factors includehandwashing‐related perceived risks, attitudes, norms, abilities and self‐regulation. Thewell‐being of the participants will be assessed in the survey using the KINDL tool whichis designed to measure health‐related quality of life in children and adolescents bylooking into different domains of well‐being (e.g. physical, mental and school). Thesurvey will also contain questions assessing the perceived sufficiency and safety of thewater supply, satisfaction with the available infrastructure for handwashing, andobstacles to water access. The survey will be administered to a randomly selected subsetof 25 students per primary school three times in total; as a baseline survey before theimplementation of the intervention package, about three months after the intervention andabout a year after the baseline survey with the software Open Data Kit (ODK) Central(version 2022.3.1) on Android tablets. Informed consent forms will be obtained from theparticipants' guardians before the day of data collection. In addition, oral assent willalso be obtained from the participants at the beginning of the interview for filling outthe survey.(ii) Module 2: Structured handwashing observations: The observations will be administeredthree times at the same time points as the survey in Module 1. To be able to assessindividual behaviours and link them to data collected using other tools, all of thestudents in the classes selected for the study will be assigned coloured badges withtheir unique IDs. Students will be informed that they are randomly assigned the colours.However, the data collector will agree with the school teachers on a specific colour tobe assigned to the 50 students selected for the study from these classes. The observationwill start at 9:00 am (60 minutes before the breakfast break) and end at 12:00 pm (90minutes after the break). The data collector will pilot the observation process beforethe intervention and in coordination with the school staff.The occurrence of handwashing with soap will be observed for each of the two criticalhandwashing events (after using the toilet and before eating) for each included student.To observe handwashing before eating (study's primary outcome), the investigators willengage participants in a painting activity, followed by a popcorn snack, which shouldprompt handwashing. During snack time, observers stationed at handwashing points willdocument who washes their hands. Observations will also include other handwashingopportunities, such as after toilet use. Outcomes will indicate whether or nothandwashing with soap occurred at these key events, with some considerations forunforeseen field complications. If feasible, the investigators will observe thehandwashing steps of students who do wash their hands. Consent for observation will beobtained at a school level, from the principal of the school, as well as from theparents.(iii) Module 3: Microbiological analysis of hand rinse samples: This module focuses onthe microbiological analysis of hand rinse samples from a random subset of 12 studentsthree times at the same time points as the survey in Module 1 and observation in Module2. The modified glove juice method is the process used for that and it involves shakingand massaging participant's hands in 350 mL of clean water contained in a 710 mLWhirl‐Pak bag (NASCO Corp., Fort Atkinson, WI), followed by drying. The bags with samplesare kept on ice and processed within four hours. Using membrane filtration, theinvestigators will detect E. Coli and total coliforms colony‐forming units (CFUs). Thiswill involve filtering the bag contents through a 47‐mm‐diameter 0.45 µm cellulosefilter, applying the filter to growth media, and incubating it at 35°C ± 0.5°C for aduration of 24 hours. the investigators plan to filter 100 mL per bag; however, the exactamount of mL will be established during piloting as the volume used is dependent on thedegree of bacterial contamination on the hands. The investigators will utilize compactdry plates to detect E.coli and total coliforms, and the detection limits will becalculated based on the filtrate volume and Whirl‐Pak volume. The lower detection limitof CFUs will be calculated by dividing 1 CFU/plate by the filtrate volume and thenmultiplying it with the total Whirl‐Pak volume of 350 mL. The upper detection limit willbe calculated by dividing 500 CFUs/plate by the filtrate volume and then multiplying itwith the Whirl‐Pak volume. For analysis, CFUs per hand will be normalized and log10transformed.(iv) Module 4: Diary approach for health outcomes and absenteeism incidence: The approachuses a diary method to track hygiene‐related health outcomes and absenteeismpost‐intervention. The key measure is hygiene‐related absenteeism, tied to conditionslike diarrhea, respiratory and skin infections, helminth infections, head lice, andtrachoma. A teacher in each school will record daily absences and reasons in anelectronic/paper diary. To account for the cluster design, the investigators willseparately calculate hygiene‐related absenteeism rates for each medical condition in eachschool by dividing the number of absences by student‐weeks, yielding rates per 100student‐weeks.(v) Module 5: personal, physical and social contextual factors survey. The cultural andcontextual factors that may influence students' handwashing and well‐being will becovered in this survey. Given the unique stressors of military occupation in Palestine,it's crucial to understand these conditions' impact on life beyond school. Theinvestigators will analyse determinants of hygiene behaviour before starting theintervention, providing insight into how to maximize effectiveness for broader hygieneinterventions in Palestine. The study uses a cross‐sectional baseline design, with aninitial assessment conducted before school randomization. Parents of the 50 includedstudents will complete a survey assessing household hygiene services, their hygieneknowledge and habits, and their child's hygiene behaviour.(vi) Module 6: Focus Group Discussions (FGDs): The FGDs generate extensive data quickerthan individual interviews. The investigators will conduct 10 gender‐separated FGDs inthe selected schools during autumn 2023. This separation also encourages open,free‐speaking environments without fear of teasing or embarrassment. Each group willconsist of 5‐8 students, ensuring a fair representation from each class participating inthe study. To avoid dominance issues, the investigators will ensure all students within agroup are of the same age. Furthermore, there will be 5 FGDs specifically designed for5‐8 teachers from schools involved in the intervention. The team conducting the FGDs,ideally including the SwissTPH PhD student, will consist of a moderator and a note‐taker.FGDs will be tape‐recorded, transcribed, and translated into English for analysis, withobservations noted in a field research journal. Analysis will be conducted using MaxQDA(VERBI Software, Marburg, Germany) or NVivo software (QSR International, Melbourne,Australia).(vii) Module 7: Key informant interviews (KIIs): The key informant interviews will bewith education ministry stakeholders, school committee members, and community leaders, togain detailed insights into specific issues and proposed solutions. This data will becollected in autumn 2023, providing depth that FGDs might miss due to group dynamics.Interviewers, trained similarly to those for FGDs, will audio record interviews, withtranscripts translated into English for analysis using either MaxQDA (VERBI Software,Marburg, Germany) or NVivo software. In some cases, interviews may be conducted remotelyin English.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT05964478,,,Trial registry record,,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02587713/full,

Shigella is a leading contributor to diarrheal diseases caused by bacterial pathogens and is considered a significant antimicrobial resistance threat. While improvements in hygiene, and access to clean water help as control measures, vaccination remains one of the most viable options for significantly reducing morbidity and mortality. Methods: Flexyn2a is a bioconjugate vaccine manufactured using novel conjugation methodologies enzymatically linking the O‐polysaccharide of S. flexneri 2a to exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The protective capacity of Flexyn2a was assessed in a controlled human infection model after two intramuscular immunizations. Immune responses pre‐ and post‐immunization and/or infection were investigated and are described here. Findings: Flexyn2a induced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‐specific serum IgG responses post‐immunization which were associated with protection against shigellosis. Additionally, several other immune parameters, including memory B cell responses, bactericidal antibodies and serum IgA, were also elevated in vaccinees protected against shigellosis. Immunization with Flexyn2a also induced gut‐homing, LPS‐specific IgG and IgA secreting B cells, indicating the vaccine induced immune effectors functioning at the site of intestinal infection. Interpretation: Collectively, the results of these immunological investigations provide insights into protective immune mechanisms post‐immunization with Flexyn2a which can be used to further guide vaccine development and may have applicability to the larger Shigella vaccine field.

The water exchange method has the advantage of facilitating intubation during colonoscopy. Here, we evaluated the effects of water exchange on procedure‐related variables related to SBE. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary‐care referral center in China. Patients due for attempted total enteroscopy were randomly allocated to undergo water exchange‐assisted (water exchange group) or carbon dioxide‐insufflated enteroscopy (CO2 group). All patients were planned to undergo both anterograde and retrograde procedures. The primary outcome was the total enteroscopy rate. Secondary outcomes included the maximal insertion depth, positive findings, procedural time, and adverse events. RESULTS: In total, 110 patients were enrolled, with 55 in each group. Baseline characteristics between the two groups were comparable. Total enteroscopy was achieved in 58.2 % (32/55) of the water exchange group and 36.4 % (20/55) of the control group (P = 0.02). The mean (standard deviation) estimated intubation depth was 521.2 (101.4) cm in the water exchange group and 481.6 (95.2) cm in the CO2 group (P = 0.04). The insertion time was prolonged in the water exchange group compared with the CO2 group (178.9 [45.1] minutes vs. 154.2 [27.6] minutes; P < 0.001). Endoscopic findings and adverse events were comparable between the two groups.

The present controlled‐intervention study investigated the relationship between patterns of dietary intake and baseline gut microbiota in CD patients in remission and examined the effects of a dietary intervention in patients consuming a non‐diversified diet [NDD]. METHODS: Forty outpatients with quiescent CD were recruited in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Based on 3‐day food records, patients consuming a lower plant‐based and higher red and processed meat‐based diet were assigned to the NDD group [n = 15] and received a 12‐week structured dietary intervention; all other patients were assigned to the diversified diet [DD] control group [n = 25] and received conventional management. Faecal microbiota composition, short chain fatty acids [SCFAs] and calprotectin were measured. RESULTS: At baseline the NDD and DD groups had a different faecal microbial beta‐diversity [p = 0.003, permutational multivariate analysis of variance]. The NDD group had lower Faecalibacterium and higher Escherichia/Shigella relative abundances compared to the DD group [3.3 ± 5.4% vs. 8.5 ± 10.6%; 6.9 ± 12.2% vs. 1.6 ± 4.4%; p ≤ 0.03, analysis of covariance]. These two genera showed a strong negative correlation [rs = ‐0.60, q = 0.0002]. Faecal butyrate showed a positive correlation with Faecalibacterium [rs = 0.52, q = 0.002], and an inhibitory relationship with Escherichia/Shigella abundance [four‐parameter sigmoidal model, R = ‐0.83; rs = ‐0.44, q = 0.01], respectively. After the 12 weeks of dietary intervention, no difference in microbial beta‐diversity between the two groups was observed [p = 0.43]. The NDD group demonstrated an increase in Faecalibacterium [p < 0.05, generalized estimated equation model], and resembled the DD group at the end of the intervention [p = 0.84, t‐test with permutation]. We did not find an association of diet with faecal SCFAs or calprotectin. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary patterns are associated with specific gut microbial compositions in CD patients in remission. A diet intervention in patients consuming a NDD modifies gut microbial composition to resemble that seen in patients consuming a DD.

CN-02323056,"Gon, G",Clean frontline: a stepped wedge cluster trial of an environmental hygiene educational intervention across thirteen Cambodian hospitals,Antimicrobial resistance and infection control,2021,"Introduction: Environmental hygiene is a key component of infection prevention in healthcare, and a driver of healthcare associated infections. Staff who clean in many low resource countries receive no formal training on cleaning, waste disposal and linen handling. This issue has been execrated by the COVID‐19 pandemic. The only recommended training on environmental hygiene for low resourced facilities, TEACH CLEAN, uses a training of trainers model. A selected cadre “champions” which in turn train their peers with responsibilities on environmental hygiene at the facility level. Early pilot data to test its effecteveness of this training package are very promising. Objectives: The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of an environmental cleaning bundle to improve microbiological cleanliness in Cambodian hospitals. Methods: TEACH CLEAN will be implemented across all hospitals (13) of three provinces in Cambodia. A stepped wedge randomised trial will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of TEACH CLEAN to improve microbiological cleanliness in Cambodian hospitals. All facilities will receive the intervention. Hospitals are arranged in groups of three or four based on the randomisation with staggered commencement dates of the intervention at four distinct time points. The design will include nine months of data collection. Intervention months will vary between two and seven. We expect one month gap between the training of champions and the training of staff at the facility level. The main outcome is microbiological cleanliness (< 2.5 cfu/ cm2 = clean; ≥ 2.5 cfu/cm2 = not clean) measured using a non‐specific agar on one side for measuring total Aerobic Colony Counts (ACC/ cm2). A secondary outcome will be presence/absence of S.Aureus. With 30 sampling sites in each hospital and with a pre‐training cleanliness proportion ranging from 30 to 50% will give us over 85% power to detect a 10% absolute post‐intervention increase in cleanliness. Results: NOTE: This is a trial protocol presentaiton as the trial will commence in June 2021. Conclusion: Evidence from the this trial will contribute to future policy and practice guidelines about hospital environmental hygiene and ultimately reduce healthcare associated infections. This would be the first randomised trial on environmental hygiene in low resource settings.",10,SUPPL 1,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 636025451,,,,Journal article; Conference proceeding,*environmental sanitation; Cambodia; Cleaning; Comparative effectiveness; Conference abstract; Controlled study; Healthcare associated infection; Human; Multicenter study; Nonhuman; Outcome assessment; Practice guideline; Randomization; Randomized controlled trial; Responsibility; Staphylococcus aureus,10.1186/s13756-021-00974-z0,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02323056/full,
CN-02293885,"Burt, RK; Han, X; Quigley, K; Balabanov, R",Outcome of Non-Myeloablative Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Multiple Sclerosis: a Single Center Summary of 511 Patients,Bone marrow transplantation,2021,"Background: The MIST randomized trial of 100 patients (55 in each arm) of nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) versus continued disease modifying therapy (DMT) for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) demonstrated marked superiority for HSCT. However, no large trial of non‐myeloablative HSCT for RRMS has been published to date. Methods: Five hundred and eleven patients at Northwestern University between 7‐2003 and 10‐2019 underwent non‐myeloablative HSCT using a non‐selected graft and cyclophosphamide (Cy)/rabbit anti‐thymocyte globulin (ATG) (n = 376), Cy/ATG/rituximab (n = 63), Cy/ATG/intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (n = 46), or Cy/alemtuzumab (n = 26). Either an intravenous cephalosporin cefepime (maxipimeâ) or piperacillin/tozobactam (zosyn®) was started on day 0 and continued until engraftment that usually occurred on day 9 or 10. Results: There was one treatment related death (0.19%, 1/511) due to legionella pneumonia acquired from the hospital room shower head. Only one of 511 patients developed bacteremia (Klebsiella pneumonia). Overall survival was 98.6%. Six patients had late non‐treatment related deaths, a cerebrovascular accident related to medication non‐compliance, a myocardial infarction, and during an elective cholecystectomy (unknown cause); colon cancer; and one died of respiratory failure from relapsed NMO (misdiagnosed as MS). The secondary autoimmune diseases (2ndADs) that occurred post HSCT were idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) and hypo or hyperthyroidism. The incidence of ITP was highest with alemtuzumab (14%) and 0 to 2.8% for the non‐alemtuzumab regimens. Before HSCT, hypothyroidism was present in 10.4% (n = 53) and hyperthyroidism in 1.5% (n = 8) of patients. After HSCT, 16 patients developed hypothyroidism (3.5% 16/450 at risk) and 15 developed hyperthyroidism/Grave's disease (3.3%). Probability of relapse free survival at 6 months, and 1, 2, 3,4, and 5 years after HSCT was 99%, 96%, 94%, 92%, and 89.5%, respectively (figure 1A). Disability measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) improved for the entire group (figure 1B) from a mean before HSCT of 4.0, to 3.04, 2.95, 2.96, 2.86, 2.78, and 2.54 at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively (all p < 0.00001). Patients treated with different non‐myeloablative conditioning regimens had similar post improvements in baseline EDSS (figure 1 B). Conclusions: Autologous non‐myeloablative HSCT provides drug free reversal of neurologic disability of greater than 1.0 EDSS points for greater than 5 years in 89% of patients with RRMS. The low incidence of bacteremia may be related to the use of non‐myeloablative regimens that do not cause mucositis, i.e. gut endothelium bacterial barrier remains closed, placement and removal of the large bore apheresis catheter on the same day and subsequent insertion of a PICC line in the upper inner arm on day of admission resulting in less risk of cutaneous barrier breaches, a HEPAfiltered floor, and to the use of pre‐emptive antibiotics when neutropenic. On the other hand, one patient developed legionella pneumonia that was subsequently cultured from the showerhead. Control over the hospital water supply is therefore of major importance.

Secondary bile acid profiles have been postulated as a potential marker for cirrhosis progression. Modulating gut microbiota dysbiosis using a nonsystemic antibiotic such as rifaximin may beneficially impact the bile acid pool. This post hoc subanalysis evaluated fecal bile acid profiles in patients with early decompensated cirrhosis treated with rifaximin soluble solid dispersion (SSD) tablets, an investigational rifaximin formulation with improved water solubility, while maintaining minimal systemic exposure. Methods: In a phase 2, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, dose‐finding trial, adults with cirrhosis and ascites (grade ≥1), with no history of esophageal variceal bleeding or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, received rifaximin SSD or placebo once nightly for 24 weeks (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01904409). This post hoc subanalysis evaluated data from patients receiving rifaximin SSD immediate‐release (IR) tablets 40 mg (most efficacious dose) or placebo once daily. Stool samples were collected at screening (Day ‐21 to Day ‐7), after 24 weeks of treatment, and at 2 weeks post‐treatment (Week 26). Bile acids were extracted from stool and profiles were determined using highperformance liquid chromatography, per published methods (Kakiyama G, et al. J Lipid Res. 2014;55[5]:978‐990). Results: Stool samples were analyzed for 48 patients in rifaximin SSD IR 40‐mg group and 50 patients in the placebo group. At screening, mean (SD) total fecal bile acid concentrations were 12.2 (18.6) and 8.2 (9.8) µmol/g of stool for rifaximin SSD IR 40 mg and placebo, respectively; 3.8 (10.8) and 1.6 (3.2) µmol/g of stool for primary bile acids; and 7.7 (10.2) and 5.7 (8.4) µmol/g of stool sample for secondary bile acids. A significantly higher mean concentration of total and secondary bile acids were observed in the rifaximin SSD IR 40‐mg group versus placebo at Weeks 24 and 26 (Figure): for total bile acids, the difference was 0.6 µmol/g (95% CI, 0.1‐1.1; P=0.02), and for secondary bile acids, 0.9 µmol/g (95% CI, 0.0‐1.7; P=0.046).

Secondary bile acid profiles have been postulated as a potential marker for cirrhosis progression. Modulating gut microbiota dysbiosis using a nonsystemic antibiotic such as rifaximin may beneficially impact the bile acid pool. Aims & Methods: This post hoc subanalysis evaluated faecal bile acid profiles in patients with early decompensated cirrhosis treated with rifaximin soluble solid dispersion (SSD) tablets, an investigational rifaximin formulation with improved water solubility, while maintaining minimal systemic exposure. In a phase 2, randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, dose‐finding trial, adults with cirrhosis and ascites (grade ≥1), with no history of oesophageal variceal bleeding or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, received rifaximin SSD or placebo once nightly for 24 weeks (Clinical‐Trials.gov identifier: NCT01904409). This post hoc subanalysis evaluated data from patients receiving rifaximin SSD immediate‐release (IR) tablets 40 mg (most efficacious dose) or placebo once nightly at bedtime. Stool samples were collected at screening (Day ‐21 to Day ‐7), after 24 weeks of treatment, and at 2 weeks post‐treatment (Week 26). Bile acids were extracted from stool, and profiles were determined using high‐performance liquid chromatography, per published methods (Kakiyama G, et al. J Lipid Res. 2014;55[5]:978‐990). Results: Stool samples were analysed for 48 patients in the rifaximin SSD IR 40‐mg group and 50 patients in the placebo group. At screening, mean (SD) total faecal bile acid concentrations were 12.2 (18.6) and 8.2 (9.8) μmol/g of stool for rifaximin SSD IR 40 mg and placebo, respectively; 3.8 (10.8) and 1.6 (3.2) μmol/g of stool for primary bile acids; and 7.7 (10.2) and 5.7 (8.4) μmol/g of stool for secondary bile acids. A higher mean concentration of total and secondary bile acids was observed in the rifaximin SSD IR 40‐mg group versus placebo at Weeks 24 and 26; at Week 26 for total bile acids, the difference was 0.6 μmol/g (95% CI, 0.1‐1.1; P=0.02), and for secondary bile acids, 0.9 μmol/g (95% CI, 0.0‐1.7; P=0.02). Conclusion: Rifaximin SSD IR 40 mg once nightly for 24 weeks increased the total and secondary faecal bile acid concentrations versus placebo in patients with early decompensated cirrhosis.

Diarrheal diseases are the leading cause of preventable death, especially among under‐five children in developing countries, including Ethiopia. Although efforts have been made to reduce the morbidity and mortality resulting from diarrheal diseases, there is scarce information on the progress of the interventions against the burdens. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of diarrhea and its associated factors in under‐five children in Horo Guduru Wollega Zone, Oromia Region, Western Ethiopia. Methods. A community‐based cross‐sectional study was conducted. Of 12,316 households, 620 households that had under‐five children were selected by simple random sampling technique from randomly selected kebeles. Before data collection, a pretest of the structured questionnaires was done on nonselected kebeles. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the association of the diarrheal diseases with independent variables. Finally, the odds ratio along with a 95% confidence interval was used to report the significant association between the outcome variable and its associated factors. A P value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant Results. The prevalence of diarrhea among under‐five children was 149 (24%) (95% CI: 20.8, 27.3). Diarrhea was significantly associated with poor knowledge of mothers/caretakers on diarrhea prevention methods (AOR: 2.05, 95% CI (1.14, 3.69), being in the age group of 6‐11(AOR = 1.546 (1.68, 3.52), and 12‐23 months (AOR = 1.485 (1.84, 2.63)), families with poor wealth index (AOR: 2.41, 95% CI (1.29, 4.51)), children who were not vaccinated against measles (AOR: 4.73, 95% CI (2.43, 9.20)), unsafe child feces disposal (AOR = 3.75; 95% CI (1.91, 7.39)), inappropriate liquid waste disposal (AOR = 3.73 (1.94, 7.42)), and having two or more siblings (AOR: 3.11, 95% CI (1.81, 5.35)). Conclusion and Remarks. The prevalence of diarrhea among under‐five children was high. There was a statistically significant association between diarrhea and age of the child (6‐11 and 12‐23), poor knowledge of mothers/caretakers on diarrhea prevention methods, families with poor wealth index, being unvaccinated against measles, improper liquid waste disposal, unsafe child feces disposal, and having at least two siblings. The findings have a significant policy inference for childhood diarrheal disease prevention programs. Therefore, educating mothers/caregivers on diarrheal disease prevention methods, child spacing, regular hand washing practice after disposing child feces, safely disposing liquid waste, and vaccinating all eligible children against measles should be a priority area of intervention for diarrheal disease prevention. Moreover, since these associated factors are preventable, the government needs to strengthen the health extension workers program implementations to reduce childhood diarrhea.",2021,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 2013475733,,,,Journal article,*Ethiopia; *diarrhea /epidemiology; *prevalence; Adult; Article; Child; Child nutrition; Cross‐sectional study; Data quality; Feces; Female; Hand washing; Health practitioner; Household; Human; Human experiment; Information processing; Liquid waste; Major clinical study; Male; Measles; Measles vaccination; Mother; Normal human; Solid waste; Structured questionnaire,10.1155/2021/5547742,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02295077/full,

Global health,2020,"BACKGROUND: As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) spreads, weak health systems must not become a vehicle for transmission through poor infection prevention and control practices. We assessed the compliance of health workers with infection prevention and control practices relevant to COVID‐19 in outpatient settings in Tanzania, before the pandemic. METHODS: This study was based on a secondary analysis of cross‐sectional data collected as part of a randomised controlled trial in private for‐profit dispensaries and health centres and in faith‐based dispensaries, health centres, and hospitals, in 18 regions. We observed provider‐patient interactions in outpatient consultation rooms, laboratories, and dressing rooms, and categorised infection prevention and control practices into four domains: hand hygiene, glove use, disinfection of reusable equipment, and waste management. We calculated compliance as the proportion of indications (infection risks) in which a health worker performed a correct action, and examined associations between compliance and health worker and facility characteristics using multilevel mixed‐effects logistic regression models. FINDINGS: Between Feb 7 and April 5, 2018, we visited 228 health facilities, and observed at least one infection prevention and control indication in 220 facilities (118 [54%] dispensaries, 66 [30%] health centres, and 36 [16%] hospitals). 18 710 indications were observed across 734 health workers (49 [7%] medical doctors, 214 [29%] assistant medical officers or clinical officers, 106 [14%] nurses or midwives, 126 [17%] clinical assistants, and 238 [32%] laboratory technicians or assistants). Compliance was 6·9% for hand hygiene (n=8655 indications), 74·8% for glove use (n=4915), 4·8% for disinfection of reusable equipment (n=841), and 43·3% for waste management (n=4299). Facility location was not associated with compliance in any of the infection prevention and control domains. Facility level and ownership were also not significantly associated with compliance, except for waste management. For hand hygiene, nurses and midwives (odds ratio 5·80 [95% CI 3·91‐8·61]) and nursing and medical assistants (2·65 [1·67‐4·20]) significantly outperformed the reference category of assistant medical officers or clinical officers. For glove use, nurses and midwives (10·06 [6·68‐15·13]) and nursing and medical assistants (5·93 [4·05‐8·71]) also significantly outperformed the reference category. Laboratory technicians performed significantly better in glove use (11·95 [8·98‐15·89]), but significantly worse in hand hygiene (0·27 [0·17‐0·43]) and waste management (0·25 [0·14‐0·44] than the reference category. Health worker age was negatively associated with correct glove use and female health workers were more likely to comply with hand hygiene. INTERPRETATION: Health worker infection prevention and control compliance, particularly for hand hygiene and disinfection, was inadequate in these outpatient settings. Improvements in provision of supplies and health worker behaviours are urgently needed in the face of the current pandemic.

CN-02192194,"Chandra Davuluri, P",EMPYEMA THORACIS: a COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF TB AND NON-TB ETIOLOGY AND THEIR OUTCOMES,Chest,2020,"SESSION TITLE: Chest Infections Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18‐21, 2020 PURPOSE: 1. To study the tuberculous and non‐tuberculous patterns in the etiology of Empyema. 2. To compare the age, sex distribution among tuberculous and non‐tubercluous groups. 3. To know the effect of early intervention, prognosis, treatment modalities and outcomes in tuberculous and non‐tuberculous empyema. METHODS: A prospective study of empyema thoracis was conducted on 52 consecutive patients with empyema thoracis admitted to the tuberculosis and chest diseases ward of a teaching hospital over one‐and‐a‐half‐year period with the objective of comparing the etiology, clinical profiles and outcomes of patients. The demographic data, clinical presentation, microbiological findings, etiology, the clinical course and management were recorded as per a planned pro forma and analyzed. RESULTS: Out of 52 cases, 30 (57.7%) cases were of non TB etiology where as TB constitute 42.3%. Gram negative organisms 28.8% cases, Gm+ve 15.3%. In TB empyema mean age of presentation was 35.8 years & 44.46 yrs in non TB. Average duration of symptom presentation in TB & non TB empyema are 40.35 & 21.13 days respectively. Mean duration of intercostal tube drainage in TB was 33.55 days vs 18.36 days in non TB empyema. Bronchopleural fistula present in 54.54% of tuberculous versus 20% of non‐tuberculous empyema. Good lung expansion with minimal pleural thickening seen in 25(83.33%) cases of non TB cases but only 59% cases of TB empyema had good resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Empyema continues to be prevalent in our country particularly in the lower socioeconomic strata due to the delay in seeking medical care, inappropriate antibiotics and dosages and duration of antibiotic treatment. Pleural fluid biochemical parameters would also vary depending on the stage of empyema, severity and previous antibiotic therapy. Management of primary empyema continues to be controversial in terms of duration of antibiotic therapy and the indications for and timing of surgery. There is a need for randomized controlled trials for strict guidelines on the management of empyema Tuberculous empyema differs from non‐tuberculous empyema in the age profile, Clinical presentation, management issues, and has a significantly poorer outcome. All cases of empyema with bronchopleural fistula should be managed by intercostal drainage tube connected to water seal. It was also observed that all cases of empyema complicated by bronchopleural fistula were difficult to manage and needed major surgery. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Tuberculous empyema remains a significant cause of empyema thoracis in India. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of rapid diagnostic tools like CBNAAT with reliable sensitivity and specificity in the diagnostic algorithm for the early diagnosis of tuberculous empyema which would help in planning the treatment of empyema.

However, not all cases have clinical symptoms, H. pylori are described as gram negative bacteria which causes ulcers in the lining of stomach or the upper part of small intestine. For some patients, a progressive infection can cause gastric cancer which is the second widespread cancer worldwide (1). While this pathogen in Egypt is a public health issue, the propagation of H. pylori infection is approximately 80% (2), study results concluded that H. pylori infection in upper Egypt was higher than in urban areas (3). Transmission modes of H. pylori are very controversial, the reservoir of H. pylori is the human stomach. The main method of acquisition in both developing and developed countries by fecal oral route, whereas the other route of transmission in developed countries is the gastro‐oral route mainly water borne prevalence, overcrowding of the family of large number members, institutionalized children are predisposing for acquiring the infection. (4:6), and occupational risk factor for health members, in particular those working in gastrointestinal units (7). Over spread of the infection in upper Egypt could be due to the hygiene level, socioeconomic conditions, life style, and absence of sources of pure water supply in rural areas (3). H. pylori has been classified as one of the 12 bacterial species need high priority future strategies for new antibiotic development by the World Health Organization (WHO), management of H. pylori is widely debatable due to high antibiotics resistance prevalence after exclusion of inadequate gastric suppression by proton pump inhibitor and poor adherence to the therapy. Furthermore, the efficacy of many regimens has declined due to increased antibiotic resistance making H. pylori eradication challenging, H. pylori treatment has been complicated and has required 10 and 14 days of multiple daily doses of three or four different medicines. (8:13). There is no worldwide accepted regimen for the eradication of H. pylori infection. Standard triple therapy (STT) with proton pump inhibitors (PPI) in standard dose, clarithromycin (500 mg), and amoxicillin (1 g) twice daily for 14 days is the standard triple first line regimen in the published international guidelines of the European Helicobacter and Microbiota Study Group in areas of low clarithromycin resistance (14). A randomized controlled trial in Japan showed that clarithromycin resistance is a growing problem found metronidazole to be superior to clarithromycin as a 7‐day first‐line triple regimen (15). In regions with low dual clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance (<15%), either a bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT) (PPI, bismuth salt, tetracycline, and metronidazole) or non‐bismuth concomitant quadruple therapy (PPI, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole) is recommended (14,16), In areas of high dual clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance (>15%), bismuth quadruple therapy is the recommended regimen. However, bismuth isn't available in all regions and not preferred due to complexity and the high pill burden (14 pills per day). Therefore, levofloxacin, rifabutin or high dose dual (amoxicillin and PPI) therapies have been suggested (14,17). A levofloxacin triple therapy is recommended as second‐line treatment in case of first line therapy failure; However, clarithromycin‐based triple therapy or bismuth quadruple therapy are alternative second‐line options if not used as first line regimen and clarithromycin resistance is known to be low. Third‐line and subsequent treatment strategies should be guided by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, treatment durations of 14 days and the use of newer generation PPIs are recommended in all H. pylori regimens, unless local evidence suggests that 10 days therapy is efficient (14,18,19). In Egypt, the first and second line H. pylori regimens as the international guidelines are used to eradicate H.pylori. However, these recommendations should be reviewed, due to increased resistance rate and progressive decline in eradication therapy efficacy. (20). Expert groups in USA, Canada, and Europe have issued treatment guidelines for the management of H. pylori infection to overcome the global challenge of antibiotic resistance (13). Treatment of H. pylori is still widely empiric due to antibiotic resistance, which could be prevented through culture guided therapy that associated with higher eradication rates (21,22). Some experts such as the Maastricht guidelines recommend clarithromycin susceptibility testing before prescribing clarithromycin triple regimen or after second line regimen failure, its preferable to have this test in an earlier phase than waiting for two treatment failures mostly due to increased levofloxacin resistance, a component of many second line therapies (14,23,24). Antibiotic susceptibility testing can be done by culture or molecular methods, both of which require gastric biopsies. However. This test is less cost‐effective to be adopted widespread (23). The scarcity of such data in USA was an obstacle to make strong evidence‐based treatment recommendations in the 2017 ACG guideline on H. pylori treatment (19). In USA, only two publications in the previous 20 years including fewer than 500 strains of H. pylori have revealed resistance features (13,25,26) A recent study compared the efficacy of first‐line H.pylori eradication therapies including STT, BQT, sequential therapy (ST) consisting of a PPI and amoxicillin for 5‐7 days followed by a PPI, clarithromycin, and a metronidazole for 5‐7 days, and HT. Results revealed that hybrid regimen had the best H.pylori eradication rates (27). Another study compared the efficacy of different regimens for eradication of H. pylori had shown that A 14‐day hybrid therapy has attracted global attention as this regimen proved to be safe, well tolerated and effective in high antibiotic resistance settings (28,29). A current hybrid therapy (HT) (PPI and amoxicillin for 14 days followed by clarithromycin and a nitroimidazole for 7 days) is a promising first‐line strategy for H. pylori eradication due to the rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance globally (30). To the best of our knowledge there is lacking information about hybrid regimen efficacy in eradication of H.pylori infection in Egyptian patients, our study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of hybrid regimen as a first line therapy for H. pylori eradication compared to triple and quadruple regimens in attempt to overcome antibiotic resistance.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT06315478,,,Trial registry record,Amoxicillin; Clarithromycin; Communicable Diseases; Infections; Metronidazole; Omeprazole,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02681724/full,

A total of 305 household questionnaires were performed and the awareness rate of toilet related knowledge, the positive support to toilet renovation and the satisfaction rate in this aspect reached to 95.1% (290/305), 100% (303/303), and 96.7% (291/301), respectively. The publicity materials were accessible in 88.5% (270/305) residents ""s home, and 96.1% (293/305) residents knew that the fecal fluid in tank‐third compartment were used as fertilizer. In 2020, the intestinal infectious diseases cost the surveyed village 81 000 Yuan, which decreased by 53.9% compared with 176 000 yuan in 2015. Conclusion During 2016 to 2020, the accomplishment of household toilet harmless ‐ renovation reached to the defined standard of feces harmless sanitary management in rural areas of Jiangsu Province, which could be conducive to control the transmission of infectious diseases via night soil‐mouth route, including intestinal parasitic diseases, as well as to improve sanitary conditions and protect people"" s health.",39,6,794‐798,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 2015396162,,,,Journal article,*rural area; Article; Biochemical oxygen demand; Chemical oxygen demand; China; Coliform bacterium; Disease transmission; Household; Human; Intestine infection; Manure; Nanofabrication; Nonhuman; Parasite egg count; Questionnaire,10.12140/j.issn.1000-7423.2021.06.010,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02590370/full,

DESIGN: Bedside nurses prospectively documented each patient's bowel movement (BM) using the Bristol Stool Chart type and number. Research Coordinators collected baseline and daily data evaluating risk factors for diarrhea and patient outcomes. The diarrhea definition was the World Health Organization definition of ≥3 loose or watery BMs (Bristol type 6 or 7) per day. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate risk factors and the association with the risk of death in the ICU. SETTING: Forty‐four ICUs in Canada, the United States, and Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS: All 2,650 invasively ventilated critically ill patients were enrolled in this preplanned secondary analysis of a randomized trial that evaluated the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG on infectious outcomes. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 2,650 patients, the mean age (sd) was 59.8 (16.5) years, with an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II Score of 22.0 (7.8); 61.2% received inotropes/vasopressors on study day 1. Diarrhea occurred among 60.4% of patients and on 18.2% of ICU study days. Independent risk factors for diarrhea were a history of Clostridioides difficile infection, laxatives, and antibiotic use. Adjusted for these factors, enteral nutrition, particularly with moderate‐high‐protein content, also increased the risk of diarrhea. Univariable analysis suggested that diarrhea was associated with C. difficile testing, fecal management device insertion, and increased length of ICU and hospital stay. After adjusting for illness severity, mechanical ventilation, inotropes/vasopressors, renal replacement therapy, and severe infections, diarrhea was not associated with an increased risk of death.

This infection is transmitted to humans by contaminated soil by human faecescontaining parasite eggs. These infections impact the most impoverished and marginalizedcommunities that lack access to clean water, sanitation, and proper hygiene, particularlyin tropical and subtropical regions. At the same time, the highest prevalence isdocumented in sub‐Saharan Africa, China, South America, and Asia. STH is a significantpublic health threat, with an estimated 1.5 billion people or 24% of the world populationresulting in a loss of two million disability‐adjusted life years.The nutritional status of STH‐infected children is often affected, eventually leading toimpaired health, growth, cognition, and educational outcomes. High helminth intensity andpolyparasitism may cause malnourishment and morbidity, which may result in death. Becauseof physical barrier and/or competition for food, helminths may make human hosts'malnutrition worse. Insufficient absorption of micronutrients and intestinal blood lossare more intricately linked to anaemia through an unknown process. The overall effect maychange the children's cognitive development, including memory, reaction time, learning,and intrinsic intelligence. Children in preschool are not currently included in regulardeworming programs for STH. However, the research indicates that children get infectedsoon after weaning and continue to be infected throughout childhood and adolescence.Children are negatively impacted by infections long before attending school, whichexacerbates the long‐term health risks of STH infection. Epidemiological researchconducted among SACs demonstrated that STHs had a direct impact on student performanceand absenteeism. So, deworming may play vital roles for preschool‐aged children beforeentering school.Several demographic groups are considered eligible for routine deworming, includingpreschool‐aged children (PSAC) and school‐aged children (SAC). In Bangladesh, STH wasprevalent among 79.8% of school‐age children (SAC) in 2005, which dropped to 14% inrecent times. The prevalence is higher in slums or low socio‐economic clusters (around50.54%) due to poor hygiene and malnutrition, despite homogenous mass drugadministration, MDA. More than one‐third (36.3%) of SAC are re‐infected with at least onehelminth within six months of the MDA, with the highest prevalence of TT (27.5%) and 12.4% of multiple helminth infections, which indicates the inefficiency of current PC.Bangladesh Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MOHFW) and Children Without Worms (CWW)conducted the Integrated Community‐based Survey for Program Monitoring"" (ICSPM) in 4districts in 2016 and 10 districts from 2017‐2020. According to both surveys, themoderate‐to‐high intensity infection of STH (MHII) was one of the highest in Sirajganj(7.1%) and it was above the WHO‐recommended target of <1%. A. lumbricoides was the mostcommon STH parasite followed by T. trichiura and hookworm. A. lumbricoides was mostprevalent among SAC (n = 139,8.9% ), followed by PSAC (n = 114, 8.1% ) and adults n = 99,7.4%,). All polyparasitism was due to A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura (n = 14,0.3% ) andwas only identified in Sirajganj District. Sirajganj subdistricts of concern includedBelkuchi (STH prevalence in SAC: 57.1%, 20.0% MHII) and Kamarkhanda (STH prevalence inSAC: 50.0%, 28.6% MHII). Belkuchi had the highest STH prevalence in PSAC (n = 23, 60.5%), SAC (n = 20, 57.1% ), and adults (n = 15, 50.0% ). Belkuchi had the highest MHII amongPSAC [(n = 9, 23.7%) and adults (n = 6, 20.0%), and Kamarkhanda had the highest MHIIamong SAC.Treatment of STH‐ Bangladesh perspective The latest WHO roadmap for neglected tropicaldiseases aims to eliminate STHs as a public health concern in 96% of endemic countries by2030. To combat STH the WHO suggests four medications for treating STH infections:pyrantel, levamisole, mebendazole, and albendazole. WHO introduced routine preventivechemotherapy (PC) for preschool and school‐aged children, using benzimidazoles(albendazole or mebendazole) in 2001. The benzimidazole medications, such as albendazoleand mebendazole, work by disrupting the parasitic worms' microtubular system to treat arange of parasitic infections. These are the most common medications used to treatroundworm and hookworm. These are inexpensive, secure, and simple to use as children donot need to be weighed. Both adults and children receive the same dosage. However,Albendazole and mebendazole, commonly dispensed against soil‐transmitted helminths (STH),are frequently utilized in combination with other medications to establish an integratedapproach.The widespread use of these medications for treatment and preventative chemotherapy is aresult of the excellent efficacy demonstrated by the applications of scientificknowledge. Through WHO, national health ministries in endemic countries get donations ofalbendazole and mebendazole to treat school‐age children. Bangladesh implemented anational deworming program in 2008, which involves MDA at primary schools for age groups6‐12 years with Mebendazole/Albendazole (ALB) monotherapy as preventive chemotherapy(PC), conducted at six‐month intervals. The deworming program had reached a nationaltreatment coverage increasing from 86.4% to 98.3% in the four years 2015‐2019; however,only 76.2% of PSAC were found to be dewormed through self‐prescribed locally purchaseddeworming medicines.Current Treatment Review Since 1982, Albendazole has been used extensively to treatintestinal parasites. High cure rates for lumbricoides infections are attained with asingle dosage of albendazole. The cure rates attained in various trials, however, vary.The efficacy of ALB against AL infection is well established with a 94%‐100% eggreduction rate (ERR), while it has proved inefficient in curbing TT infections (ERR:39%‐60%). A single oral dose of albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoateeffectively treats infections caused by Ascaris lumbricoides, but a single dose ofmebendazole was ineffective in combating hookworm infections in school children inZanzibar and Vietnam. A quick re‐infection, especially in the case of AL and TT, wasfound in another study aiming to assess patterns and dynamics of STH reinfection afterdrug treatment. However, treating infections from Trichuris trichiura with the currentanthelmintics in a single oral dose is unsatisfactory. The side effects of albendazoleinclude headache, leukopenia, and temporary gastrointestinal distress.Scope of Repurposing Ivermectin in STH Ivermectin (IVM) is a safe and widely usedmacrocyclic lactone due to its broad‐spectrum anti‐infective and anti‐parasitic activityagainst ecto‐ and endoparasites. Ivermectin is mostly used to treat strongyloidiasis,loiasis, onchocerciasis, and lymphatic filariasis. Additionally, it has been licensed totreat human ascariasis and has a beneficial effect on Trichuris trichiura. It paralyzesadult worms and appears to be dormant. Indirect evidence suggests a decreased burden ofsoil‐transmitted helminths in regions where albendazole and ivermectin have been jointlyadministered. While ivermectin alone is recognized for having less‐than‐optimal efficacyagainst hookworm and TT infections, available data indicates that the combinedadministration of ivermectin and albendazole may exhibit greater efficacy compared tosingle‐drug regimens. The co‐administration of ivermectin and albendazole significantlyoutperformed albendazole alone in clearing TT infections, with a relative risk (RR) of0.44 (95% CI = 0.31‐0.62) for post‐treatment infection. Patients receiving thecombination treatment demonstrated higher individual egg reduction rates (ERRs) rangingfrom 91% to 100%, a cumulative cure rate (CR) of 45.8%, and an overall ERR of 84.5%,surpassing the efficacy of albendazole alone (ERR = 59.1%) and Ivermectin alone (ERR =72.1%) (p < 0.001). Ivermectin‐treated patients have not seen any significant sideeffects, according to safety trials. Adverse effects of ivermectin included abdominalpain, headache, and diarrhoea .Relevance for assessing new treatment regimen The two benzimidazole medicationsmebendazole (500 mg) and albendazole (400 mg) are currently used primarily to treat STHinfections. Both medications are highly effective against A. lumbricoides (cure rate (CR)= 96% with albendazole and CR = 96% with mebendazole), according to a 2017 meta‐analysis.However, these are less effective against hookworm (CR = 80% with albendazole and CR =33% with mebendazole), and less effective against T. trichiura (CR = 31% with albendazoleand CR = 42% with mebendazole). Given the enormous drug pressure imposed by widespreadusage and dependence on these two medications, it is imperative to step up efforts toinvestigate alternative medicines to both improve efficacy for trichuriasis and postponethe establishment of potential drug resistance.In regions where albendazole and ivermectin have been co‐administered, there is indirectevidence of a lower burden of STH. Data suggests that ivermectin and albendazoleadministered together can be more effective than single‐drug regimens, even thoughivermectin alone is thought to have inadequate efficacy against hookworm and T. trichiurainfections . As a result, the WHO Essential Medicines List now includes ivermectin andalbendazole together for the treatment of STH infection. Future MDA campaigns areexpected to support the use of ivermectin‐albendazole co‐treatment since it is listed inthe WHO Model List of Essential Medicines to treat STH.As the WHO suggested revising the frequency of MDA treatments, the discovery of therapyto increase efficacy, delay the reinfection time, and halt the emergence of potentialdrug resistance is paramount. Evidence does exist that PSAC benefits from deworming, andothers have advocated for PSAC inclusion in MDA. Deworming of PSAC will help to addressthe infections at the earlier stages, potentially preventing the progression of diseaseand associated complications. Besides that, the upscaling of PC over the past years hasincreased the selective drug pressure on STH‐affected populations, posing the risk oftriggering anthelmintic drug resistance. In addition, deworming PSAC complements effortsto break the cycle of transmission within communities, reducing the overall burden of STHinfections.Research Design and MethodsResearch plan/experimental design:Study Site The research will be conducted in rural settings in the Belkuchi sub‐district(upazila) of Sirajganj district, which had the highest STH prevalence among PSACs(60.5%). The investigators will set up a field office there for conducting patientscreening, enrolment, microscopic examination, treatment, and follow‐up.Study Population In this study, the investigators will screen about 300 preschool‐agedchildren (PSAC) by household visits to the study site, and then the investigators willrandomly select 110 pre‐SACs following all the inclusion and exclusion criteria and putthem into randomization for selecting treatment arm.Screening and enrolment of the patients:The study will be done in a rural area (Belkuchi Sub‐district) of Sirajganj District ofBangladesh. The investigators will set up a field office in the study area with a radiusof about 5 km from the office. At the initiation phase of the project, a household (HH)survey will be conducted in the study area after obtaining consent from the HH head(s).Trained field assistants will visit every house of the study site and enlist childrenfalling within the age limit. Parents or guardians of the enlisted children will beinvited and will receive detailed information about the study's objectives, procedures,potential benefits, and risks. The investigators will hold an open discussion sessionencouraging parents and others to ask questions and provide ample time for them to decidewhether to allow the children to participate. Then, the investigators will obtaininformed written consent from parents or guardians of the eligible children. At baseline,the study physician, the medical lab technician, and trained field assistants will beassigned to screen the participants and collect stool samples from potential participantsfor examination for STH. Participants will be enrolled in compliance with the studyinclusion and exclusion criteria after being examined by the study physician to ensuremaximum patient safety. All the study activities, including the participant screening,will be done after the proper consent of the parents / legal guardians of theparticipants. The investigators will document the details of all eligible children,including name, sex, age, and school grade. Then the investigators will ask them forhaving any clinical symptoms and perform physical examinations. Additionally, Theinvestigators will measure height to the nearest centimetres, and weight will be recordedto the nearest 0.1 kg. A sterile empty stool container will be provided to the parents ofeligible children, marked with unique identification numbers, and parents will be askedto return the container along with a fresh morning stool sample of the child.Treatment Allocation:The enrolled participants will be randomly assigned to one of the treatment arms throughindividual randomization using MS Excel software. Each patient will draw a sealed andnumbered envelope and thus have an equal chance to receive either of the regimens. Theinvestigators will not use block randomization. As the study participants are 2‐5 yearsold and the investigators will conduct the study on a single site, the investigators willuse open randomization using numbered envelopes. Treatment Regimen will be assigned arandom number 1‐110, 55 in each arm. Inside the chosen envelope there will be a cardspecifying the assigned treatment ‐ either the ""Standard Treatment Regimen"" (Albendazole400mg monotherapy) or the ""Combination Therapy Treatment Regimen"" (a single dose ofAlbendazole 400mg + Ivermectin (200 μg/kg). The selected card is then placed back intothe envelope for drug accountability and monitoring purposes. The approach to concealingthe treatment arm by random selection of the study participants will avoid selection biasin the study.Drug Dispensing:After being randomized to either treatment arm, children will be provided with themedication, Albendazole will be given in syrup form, and Ivermectin tablet will be givenin powdered form as Ivermectin suspension is not available in Bangladesh. Following allthe aseptic procedure, the investigatorswill crush the commercially available 6 mgunscored Ivermectin tablets make a powder form with the tablet fragments, and preservethem in an airtight plastic container in a cool and dry place. According to the weight ofthe children, the investigators will provide the needed amount (weighted by microgramscale) of the drug mixed with 5 ml of water. Study fiield staffs will help the parents togive the medicine to the child by the direct observation therapy (DOT) method. Theparents will be advised to bring the children on an empty stomach in the morning.Ivermectin will be given first, and a light snack will be provided 30 minutes aftertaking ivermectin. Then albendazole will be given to the children. Both drugs will begiven using direct observation at the field clinic. Parents will be advised to report anyadverse effects including vomiting, after taking medication. If vomiting occurs withinone hour of medication, a redosing will be provided.Blinding and procedures for unblinding This study will be an single blinded clinicaltrial. The investigators and study physicians will not be blinded. The investigators arenot using any placebo arm for this trial, the approach to concealing the treatment arm byrandom selection of the study participants will avoid selection bias in the study.However, the primary objective of the study is a cure assessment of STH infection, whichwill be performed based on the egg reduction rate (ERR) with stool samples. To ensure theavoidance of any bias in the test, the laboratory personnel doing the procedures will beblinded.Lab procedures:Stool sample collection and microscopic examination: One fresh morning stool sample willbe collected from each suspected STH‐infected child at baseline and follow‐up periods.The stool samples will be carried out to the field clinic within 30 minutes ofcollection, and slide preparation and other processing will be done in the next 30minutes, and every sample should be assessed within one hour of the collection time. Theexpert field staffs and laboratory personnel will coordinate the entire process.Duplicate Kato‐Katz thick smears will be prepared for each stool sample using 41.7 mgtemplates. All slides will be scrutinized within 60 minutes after preparation to preventthe over‐clearing of hookworm eggs. To ensure the accuracy of microscopic diagnoses, 10%of the Kato‐Katz thick smears will be randomly selected for a re‐examination. Ininstances of conflicting results, slides will undergo a third reading, and the outcomeswill be deliberated upon until a consensus is achieved; the agreement between the initialreadings of the Kato‐Katz thick smears and the quality control process should exceed 95%.In all the follow‐up periods (five times) the same methods will be applied, so a total ofsix times stool samples will be collected from each child. At the field site, skilled andtrained laboratory personnel will perform all laboratory investigations and examine thicksmears for the presence of eggs from TT, hookworm, and AL during the enrolment andfollow‐up periods.Blood: Only at baseline and 3 months follow‐up, the investigatorswill also collect 2‐4 mlof blood following all standard and aseptic techniques, using a butterfly needle for thechild, which will puncture a vein in the elbow and blood will slowly suck into thesyringe. After collecting blood, the needle will be pulled out gently and participantswill be asked to continue to press the puncture site with alcohol cotton for a whileuntil the bleeding stops, and then a band‐aid will be applied to it. Then the collectedblood will be assessed following all the standard procedures for slide preparation andcell counts for complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate anaemia and/or any otherabnormalities.Kato‐Katz technique:The cellophane faecal thick‐smear examination (Kato‐Katz technique) has proved to be anefficient means of diagnosis of soil‐transmitted helminths. Cellophane thick‐smear slidescan be prepared in the field, stored in microscopic slide boxes, and shipped at greatdistances, for examination at a central laboratory if required. To ensure accurate andreliable results, quality control must be applied to laboratory procedures for diagnosingparasitic infections. Controls must apply to the collection of specimens, preparation ofreagents, performance of the techniques, and examination of the final preparations.The foundation of the Kato‐Katz approach is a stool sample of variables (usually 41.7 mg)weighted using a sieved stool sample filled in a template hole. Therefore, it isnecessary to apply a multiplication factor to convert the number of eggs observed bymicroscopy to EPG. The AM EPG of the two or four slides per participant will becalculated at baseline for each parasite species, study, and treatment group within thestudy if applicable.Egg Reduction Rate (ERR) and Cure Rate (CR) Assessment Egg count assessments are usuallylongitudinal, which means that the same subjects are evaluated both before and aftertaking medication. In both medication trials and field settings, it is standard procedureto reject participants with zero pretreatment egg counts from additional testing toconserve resources.Cure rate (CR) and egg reduction rate (ERR) are two typical ways to express drugefficacy. The WHO‐recommended primary outcome measure for anthelmintic drug efficacy isthe egg reduction rate (ERR). This quantitative measure expresses the percentagereduction in eggs per gram of stool (EPG) estimated before and after drug administration.The ERR is based on group arithmetic mean (AM) EPG, as recommended by WHO, rather than onindividual EPG counts, however, the range of personal responses is broad.The WHO‐recommended reference efficacy standards are: ""Anthelmintic drug efficacy issatisfactory if the ERR is superior or equal to the reference value; doubtful if the ERRis inferior to the reference value by less than 10 percentage points; reduced if the ERRis inferior to the reference value by at least 10 percentage points."" The percentage ofegg‐positive people who turned egg‐negative following treatment is known as the CR.Because CR requires no distributional assumptions and has a lower sensitivity to outliersthan the ERR, it is frequently chosen for use in randomized clinical studies. However, infield settings, the ERR is preferable because it is more comparable across settings andis less impacted by pretreatment infection levels than the CR, which is lower at greaterpretreatment egg counts.ERR=[((meanEPG⁡count_(pre‐treatment)‐meanEPG⁡count_(post‐treatment)))⁄(meanEPG⁡count_(pre‐treatment) )]x100.Individual ERR is calculated as the ratio of the difference between the pre‐andpost‐treatment EPG to the pre‐treatment EPG multiplied by one hundred. CRs and 95%binomial CIs were the percentage of stool‐negative individuals at post‐treatmentfollow‐up. The distribution of individual responses in egg excretion was categorized as(i) negative (ERR = 100%, corresponding to the CR); (ii) reduction (ERR expressed aspercentage reduction); (iii) no change or increase (ERR = 0), and further expressed incentiles.Infection Intensity Classification:The investigators will use the WHO‐recommended cut‐off values for analysing infectionintensity at different follow‐up periods based on faecal egg count found using theKato‐Katz technique.Study Drug's labelling, and packaging Commercially available drugs will be used.Trial‐specific labelling will be applied before use. icddr,b has a meticulous procurementpolicy and a strong procurement team. In case of unavailability of any drug, theinvestigators will procure the drug through the icddr,b logistics from any national andinternational pharmaceutical company. However, before purchasing the drug, theprocurement team will assess the necessary documents, including the GMP certificate,certificate of analysis, and other regulatory documents from the respective companies.Only the drug satisfying the required standards will be obtained. All the drugs to beused in the study will be from a single source, and products from the same batch will bepurchased to ensure the homogeneity of the drugs in terms of the quality and efficacy.Accountability All study medications must be kept in a locked room that can be accessedonly by the appropriate study personnel designated by the investigator. The studymedications must not be used for other purposes other than this protocol. Under nocircumstances may the investigator or site staff supply study medications to otherinvestigators or sites or allow the medications to be used other than as directed by thisprotocol without prior authorization from the responsible party. Specific study forms fordrug accountability will be designed to allow for adequate records on receipt, use,return, loss, or other medication disposition. The study pharmacist or designatedpersonnel must maintain these accountability forms in a locked cabinet. Since the samedrugs are used in routine practice, SOPs for labelling the boxes to be used in the trialwill be developed, and the drugs used in the trial will be trial‐specifically labelledand stored completely separated from the routine drugs. The compliance is assessed andreported in the CRF.Storage Study drugs must be kept in a locked cabinet and/or in a room with restrictedaccess, under the control of the experienced designated field staff. The temperature ofthe storage location will be monitored daily and recorded in a temperature log. In theevent of temperature excursions below or above the allowable range, site staff mustinform the study monitor. After testing the samples, the testing kits will be discardedusing biohazard bags. The leftover samples will be stored in the icddr,b parasitology labat ‐80* c temperature for 10 years. Samples will be discarded either after the storageperiod or if the parents don't allow the study team to store them for future use.Concomitant treatments All medications required for concomitant conditions should bepostponed until after the end of treatment for STH unless warranted by immediate medicalneed. Common conditions such as respiratory tract infections should be treated beforestarting treatment. There are no known interactions with other commonly used medications,though this cannot be excluded. All concomitant medications used during the study shallbe recorded in the CRF. The investigators will also collect data if the children weregiven anti‐helminthic drugs before or during the 6th, 9th, and 12th month follow‐up bythe guardians and physicians. In a randomized controlled trial, The investigators assumethis can happen in both arms of the intervention, which will be analysed as mutuallyexclusive events in separate subgroups.Safety & response to Treatment:Safety: To ensure maximum patient safety, every patient will be physically examined(measuring height, weight, MUAC, general and systemic clinical examination etc.) beforeand during the follow‐up period. The investigators will exclude patients with anyabnormality, in addition to other conditions such as hypersensitivity to the study drugs,known chronic disease, or any other developmental abnormalities. All medications requiredfor any other concurrent medical condition will be warranted for immediate treatmentuntil STH infection treatment is completed. Treatment of common illnesses such asrespiratory tract infections, will be ensured before STH medication is administered. Thedrug used in the study has no known interactions or risks with other commonly used drugs.The history of taking all other drugs used during the study will be recorded in the casereport form. The investigators will monitor the children for any adverse events duringtreatment and follow‐up, and guardians of the children will be advised to report anyadverse events to the research team.Response: Response to treatment will be assessed at the 3rd week, 3rd month, 6th month,9th month, and 12th month since treatment. The cure will be assessed microscopicallyusing the egg reduction rate measurement at the 3rd week, 3rd month, 6th month, 9thmonth, and 12th month since treatment compared to the baseline data. The cure rate (CR)of STH infection was defined as the percentage of the infected population negative forhelminth eggs after anthelminthic treatment. The egg reduction rate (ERR) was defined asthe percentage reduction in egg intensity as measured by eggs per gram of faeces afteranthelminthic treatment.In the 3rd week of follow‐up, cure assessment, and egg reduction rate will be measuredand if the results are not satisfactory for the proposed combination therapy, a standardregimen of treatment will be advised to the participants. The re‐infection will beassessed at different time points (3rd,6th,9th,12th month). A 3rd month of infection willbe considered as initial treatment with negative outcomes. Here, also the standard drugtherapy will be advised for the research participants.Adverse event follow‐up All adverse events after baseline should be followed until thoseare resolved, the investigator assesses them as chronic or stable or the subjectparticipation in the trial ends (i.e., until a final report is completed for thatsubject) . Guardian of the participant children will be advised to report any adverseevent immediately after providing the medication to the child. The investigators willalso collect data regarding any adverse event during each follow‐up periods and documentit in the case report form.Quality Assurance:According to the GCP, the investigators will implement and maintain quality assurance andquality control systems with written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Qualitycontrol will be applied to each stage of data handling. The investigators will prepareand maintain adequate and accurate source documents to record all observations and otherpertinent data for each patient who entered the study. During the study, theinvestigators will check that written informed consent has been obtained from allpatients correctly and that data are recorded correctly and completely. Monitoring visitswill be conducted according to the GCP guidelines and applicable local regulations. ThePI/investigators will visit the site while participants are enrolled in the study atregular intervals according to the monitoring plan.Sample size calculation:N = 2× {z1‐α +z1‐β/(δ‐δ0)}2 × s2 Here, N samples in each group Z1‐α= 1.645 (when, α=0.05) Z1‐β= 0.845 (when, β= 0.80) δ (assumed difference in cure rate between two groups)= 20* δ0 (acceptable difference in cure rate between two groups) = 15 S (Standarddeviation) = 10*(Assumed cure rate of new treatment = 80%, Cure rate of the standard drug = 60%)Therefore, N clinical superiority= 2 x {(1.645+0.845)/ (20‐15)}2 x 102 =49.6 =50Considering an attrition rate of 10%, the calculated sample size is 50+5=55 per arm.Given a 29.1% prevalence of TT and/or Hookworm infection among the target population,around 300 PSACs will be screened to get the desired sample size.

CN-02423832,"NCT05457439,",Sustainable-psycho-nutritional Intervention Program and Its Effects on Health Outcomes and the Environment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT05457439,2022,"1. Introduction: The change from the traditional Mexican diet to a Western diet, generated by the nutritional transition, has not only generated a prevalence of more than 75% of metabolic alterations (obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, dyslipidemia) and in the gut microbiota of the Mexican population, but it has also generated the water and carbon footprint of their diet to be the highest in the world with more than 8,000 Liters per person per day (L p‐1d‐1) and 6.01 Kg CO2eq p‐1d‐1, respectively. This is linked to the aggravation of climate change, with increases of more than 1.0 ºC in the average atmospheric temperatures and the current water crisis that Mexico is going through, which affects 85% of the territory and has been referred to as the worst water drought in history, affecting the water supply of millions of Mexicans. One of the proposals for the joint solution of these problems has been the adoption of sustainable and territorial diets, which in Mexico could be carried out through the recovery of its traditional diet, both pre‐Hispanic and colonized, which, prepared with low‐fat culinary techniques and low content of animal products, can be considered as an appropriate option from a nutritional, cultural, economic and environmental perspective, dimensions that must be present for a diet to be considered as sustainable. However, to achieve the adoption of a particular diet, it is necessary to modify the eating behavior of the population. To modify both dietary and unsustainable behaviors in a population, there are multiple strategies, among which intervention programs have stood out. However, to date and both nationally and internationally, no intervention program whose objective is to promote both adequate nutrition to improve health and reduce the environmental impact of dietary behaviors, has been reported. This respecting cultural, social, economic, and psychological aspects of the population. Based on the above, this study protocol aims to design a three‐stage 15 weeks intervention program, based on the guide to designing interventions of the behavior change wheel model, which includes both nutritional and sustainability elements, in the sense of considering unsustainable dietary behaviors of the Mexican population, in addition to taking into account their social, cultural and economic aspects. In addition to these axes, the basis of behavioral modification intervention programs is psychology. Therefore, it is proposed to design a sustainable‐psycho‐nutritional intervention program, whose objective is to promote the adherence of the population to sustainable diets. But, in addition, it is proposed to evaluate its effects on environmental indicators, metabolic biomarkers, and gut microbiota, as well as clinical aspects and body composition in a Mexican population sample. Because of the effectiveness of technologies use in nutritional and environmental interventions, the intervention program will be a digital one, for which a mobile application is being designed to evaluate and monitor the intervened population. Therefore, this will be a m‐Health intervention program. One of the hypotheses of the work is that a sustainable‐psycho‐nutritional intervention digital program can modify the eating behavior of a Mexican population group and guide it towards a sustainable diet, generating decreases in glucose levels, total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDL‐C), and triglycerides (TG), and increases in HDL cholesterol (HDL‐C) levels. Likewise, another hypothesis is that this type of program can modify the composition of the gut microbiota of the population, promoting the proliferation of bacteria related to metabolic health; reduce the water and carbon footprint of the sample's diets; maintain adequate body fat levels in the population with an adequate body fat percentage or reduce them in the overweight or obese population; maintain blood pressure levels in the healthy population and lower them in the population with high blood pressure, and reduce the presence of acanthosis nigricans. 2. Methods: It is proposed to carry out a quasi‐experimental longitudinal study of three stages that will be related to each other. 2.1 Stage 1: Design of the program: A sustainable‐psycho‐nutritional intervention program will be designed based on the characteristics of a sustainable diet for the national context of Mexico, adaptable to any regional context. It will include a mobile application that is being designed for this project, which will include a sustainable food guide, sustainable‐psycho‐nutritional workshops, sustainable recipes and food plans, and behavioral change techniques. The program will be designed based on the sustainable diets model and concept, the behavior change wheel model, the guideline for the development and evaluation of digital behavioral interventions in health care, and the guide to designing interventions of the behavior change wheel, which incorporate 3 stages and 8 development steps. 2.1.1 Mobile application design: A mobile application (app) will be developed in collaboration with software and mobile applications developers and will be based on the user‐centered methodology, and the guide for the design of digital interventions. It will contain the following behavioral modification techniques: education through workshops videos; persuasion by sending messages of risks and benefits, encouragement and coercion using a token economy, nudges by messaging, self‐monitoring by graphical progress viewing, successive approaches by behavioral objectives addressing, and guides, through a sustainable food guide that will be designed by means of linear programming optimization using MATLAB®, and graphic design programs such as Canva®, Adobe Illustrator®, and BioRender®. For the token economy system, cut‐off points will be established to be charged to the app. Additionally, educational workshops and meal plans will be designed, following the model of sustainable diets, and using the Nutriecology® Nutritional‐Ecological software and the Nutrimind® Software for diet calculation. Likewise, the guidelines for the prescription of meal plans, menu design, and recipes for the Mexican population will be followed. Prior to the launch of the mobile application, its feasibility, acceptability, quality, and usability will be assessed. Also, it will be evaluated following the APEASE criteria, which include evaluating 1) Affordability, 2) Practicability, 3) Effectiveness, and Cost‐effectiveness, 4) Acceptability, 5) Side‐effects/safety, and 6) Equity. 2.1.2 Behavior change intervention design process: The process of design of the intervention will include: Stage 1: Understand the behavior: Step 1: Define the problem in behavioral terms: This step will be based on the available scientific evidence on the country's dietary and environmental situation, which reveals a high prevalence of overweight, obesity, and associated pathologies such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Also, the highest values of dietary water and carbon footprints were found. These problems are mainly related to inadequate food consumption (which will be further detailed) and lack of physical activity. Step 2: Select target behavior: The target behaviors will be lack of physical activity performance, inadequate consumption of Mexican foods and dishes, fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds, and healthy fats, dairy products, eggs, fish and shellfish, chicken, red meat (beef and pork, and, in some cases, goat and lamb) and processed, ultra‐processed foods and added and free sugars, as well as foods high in trans and saturated fats. Step 3: Specify the target behavior and Step 4: Identify what needs to change: Targets behaviors will be established as a goal‐setting strategy, which has been reported to be one of the most effective methods for modifying dietary behaviors. Also, they will be addressed as successive approximations toward a sustainable diet, another effective behavior change technique. Targets behaviors will be: 1. Increase physical activity. 2. Increase the consumption of sustainable Mexican foods and dishes. 3. Increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables. 4. Increase the consumption of whole grains. 5. Increase the consumption of legumes. 6. Increase the intake of seeds and healthy fats. 7. Reduce dairy consumption. 8. Reduce the consumption of eggs. 9. Reduce consumption of fish and shellfish. 10. Reduce chicken consumption. 11. Reduce the consumption of red (beef, pork, goat, and lamb) and processed meats. 12. Reduce the consumption of ultra‐processed foods. 13. Reduce the intake of added and free sugars, as well as foods with a high content of trans and saturated fats. All foods whose consumption will be promoted will be aligned with the sustainability characteristics for the Mexican context, on the recommendations of a healthy diet provided by the WHO, and on the model QC7G for food and nutrition education, which will specify which foods to select, in which quantities, when to consumed them and how to prepare them. In addition to when to perform physical activity, specifying type and duration. Stage 2: Identify intervention options: Step 5: Intervention functions: The intervention functions from the behavior change wheel model will be: education, persuasion, incentivization, and coercion. These will be verified in relation to the APEASE criterion. Step 6: Policy categories: The policy category of the behavior change wheel model will be the guidelines. Therefore, a nutritional‐sustainable food guide will be designed, using linear programming optimization, based on the FAO recommendations for the development of dietary guidelines, and covering the elements of the sustainable diets model as follows: 1) Wellness and Health: ABCD; A: anthropometric and body composition; B: biochemical data; C: clinical data. D: Dietetics. 2) Biodiversity, environment, and climate: carbon footprint and gray water footprint. 3) Equity and fair trade: food prices and socioeconomic level of the population. 4) ""Eco‐friendly"", local, and seasonal foods: green and blue water footprint, locally produced and seasonal foods. 5) Cultural heritage and skills: Traditional Mexican diet, Mexican Diet Quality Index Adapted (IACDMx), and nutritional education based on a traditional diet. 6) Food needs, nutrients, food security, and access: personalized food plan according to individual requirements, preferences, and contexts. Subsequently, this nutritional‐sustainable food guide will be accompanied by a system of equivalent foods that, in addition to incorporating the food's nutrients, will integrate their environmental impact. The calculation of the environmental impact will be made based on the calculation of the total, green, blue, and gray water footprint, using the Water Footprint Assessment method for Mexico. Likewise, the greenhouse gas emissions of foods will be calculated, using the Life Cycle Assessment method for food production and processing through pre‐quantified databases. The prices and cultural characteristics of the main consumed foods in Mexico will be included. Prices will be obtained based on fieldwork in supermarkets, and a review of supermarket databases, while cultural aspects will be determined based on a literature review of the traditional Mexican diet. Once sustainability dimensions are calculated, a sustainable recipe book will be developed, including examples of food plans with individualization options. These food plans will be made up of a distribution of equivalent food rations and examples of menus that meet the nutritional and sustainability characteristics of the Mexican population, with adaptation options. Stage 3: Identify content and implementation options: Step 7: Behavior change techniques: Specific behavior change techniques will be used covering the selected intervention functions as follows: ‐ Education: successive approximations in the workshops addressing the target objectives. ‐ Persuasion: Nudges, risk, and benefits communication. ‐ Incentivization, coercion, and monitoring: messaging, remainders, and token economy through food registers by writing and photos on the mobile application. ‐ Social support: forum in the mobile app where participants can share pictures of their foods and their physical activity performance. Also, will be able to like the photos of other participants and comment on the photos. Also, a chat for the resolution of doubts between user and administrator will be included in the mobile application. Step 8: Mode of delivery: The mode of delivery will be digital since a mobile application is being designed and the workshops will be delivered on digital platforms in videos. 2.2 Stage 2: Application of the sustainable‐psycho‐nutritional intervention program 2.2.1 Participants Once the intervention program has been designed, it will be applied to a sample of Mexican young adults from the south of Jalisco, randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group (n=50) and a control group (n=50). This is based on recommendations for group designs in behavior modification programs. The sample size is according to the minimum suggested for nutritional interventions, and taking into account the possible desertion of the participants during the intervention, which can amount to more than 50% of the initial sample. It will be included a population between 18 and 35 years old, with Body Mass Index (BMI) values from 18.5 to 40, with or without risk factors for the development of chronic diseases, but without diagnosis with previous pharmacological treatment. The inclusion, exclusion, and elimination criteria will be detailed in further sections. Also, for being included in the study cut‐off points to identify inadequate consumption and physical activity were established. The population will be invited to participate through social networks and posters at strategic points, such as Universities, gyms, and the downtown city. Young adults were selected as the population for this study since they are already considered adults who make autonomous food decisions, but at the same time, their young age makes them susceptible to behavioral modification. In addition, they represent parents or future parents, as well as the active population of Mexico, so providing nutritional‐sustainable education to these people could generate long‐term benefits for their health and that of their families. 2.2.2 Procedure: Participants will be evaluated following the nutritional care process model. The first evaluation will be performed at the beginning of the intervention at baseline, and according to individual requirements, the behavioral objectives will be individually adapted and will be addressed for 7 weeks, considering 2 objectives per week, thus providing 2 weekly educational workshops. Also, personalized food plans will be prescribed, according to the linear programming optimization performed at MATLAB®. After 7 weeks of educational and nutritional intervention, at week 8, the experimental population will be divided into two sub‐groups, where one group will stop being intervened completely (n = 25), and another will continue to receive messages through the mobile application (n = 25) for 8 weeks. Finally, at week 15, a final evaluation will be carried out. Participants will be evaluated in regard to Anthropometric, Biochemical, Clinical, Dietetics, Environmental, Socioeconomic level, and cultural aspects, Nutritional‐sustainable knowledge, Behavioral aspects, and Physical activity (ABCD‐ESNBP). These aspects will be evaluated according to the nutritional care process model, thus identifying the problem of the population, establishing the etiology, and stating the signs and symptoms. 2.2.3 Sustainable‐psycho‐nutritional indicators: The ABCD‐ESNBP indicators will be included in a complete clinical history that will be uploaded to the mobile application and will be evaluated according to the outcomes section. 2.3 Stage 3: Effects of the sustainable‐psycho‐nutritional intervention program: As the last stage of this protocol, the corresponding laboratory analyses, and statistical tests will be carried out. 2.3.1 Metabolic biomarkers analysis: For the analysis of metabolic biomarkers, colorimetric enzymatic methods will be used using the Spinreact® S. A/S A. U (Girona, Spain) laboratory kits, for fasting glucose determination (Cat. No. 1001190), TC (Cat. No. 41022), LDL‐C (Cat. No. BSIS51‐E), HDL‐C (Cat. No. BSIS37‐E) and TG (Cat. No. 1001313). The reference points for glucose values and lipid profiles will be taken from the regulations in force in Mexico. 2.3.2 Gut microbiota analysis: For the analysis of the gut microbiota, the real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method will be followed. First, DNA will be extracted from the collected stool samples, following the protocol for rapid purification of genomic DNA from stool samples. The Qiagen brand commercial kit (1066790ES, USA) will be used. This procedure integrates two stages: lysis and separation of impurities from stool samples, for which Inhibitex Buffer will be used and DNA purification will be carried out by means of centrifugation columns. Once the bacterial DNA samples are obtained, they will be stored and labeled in sterile plastic microtubes (Eppendorf 1.6 mL) at a temperature of ‐80°C until further analysis. Next, the purity of the DNA will be verified, and its concentration will be determined using a NanoDrop Lite spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). 1 µL of the DNA stock of each sample will be placed on the lens of the equipment and the sample will be read at a wavelength of 260 nm for DNA quantification and at 280 nm for protein quantification. The purity will be determined by calculating the index performed by the team, by dividing the reading at 260 nm by the reading at 280 nm and will be considered acceptable in a range of 1.5 to 2. The concentration of the purified coproDNA sample will be measured by their absorbance ratio of 260/280 nm using the same spectrophotometer. This analysis corresponds to the absorbance index of nucleic acids and provides the final concentration in ng/µL. Once the previous analyzes have been completed, the identification of the gut microbiota will be carried out using the qPCR molecular technique, on the StepOne Applied BioSystems platform, using the SYBR Green reagent as DNA detection chemistry. This reagent is considered an agent that intercalates into the DNA double helix and fluoresces as the DNA copies are synthesized. Therefore, at a higher concentration of the DNA of interest (bacterial), the equipment will record a higher fluorescence signal. In this case, the analysis of interest will be carried out in the V3‐V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. For this analysis, specific primers will be used. The bacterial load and relative abundance of the main bacteria present in the intestine (Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) will be determined, as well as those related to particular types of diets, for example, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium that are related to healthy, vegetarian, and Mediterranean diets, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii that is related to healthy diets and an anti‐inflammatory effect, as well as Akkermansia muciniphila, which besides of being related to anti‐inflammatory effects is associated to the consumption of the Mexican pre‐Hispanic diet. The presence of Prevotella copri will also be identified, which is one of the bacteria most related to plant‐based diets and is considered anti‐inflammatory and glucose modulator. The presence of Bilophila wadsworthia will also be identified, as it is related to diets with a high content of foods of animal origin, mainly dairy and meat, as well as in westernized diets. Likewise, the presence of Clostridium coccoides will be analyzed, as it is related to obesity and a high fat intake. Also, Streptococcus thermophilus will be included because it is related to dairy consumption. The exact procedure to follow regarding the qPCR run, as well as the specific conditions and temperatures of the analysis, are presented in a previous Mexican investigation. 2.3.3 Evaluation of the adherence to the program: To measure the adherence of the intervened population to the program, an adapted questionnaire will be applied, which will consist of the contrast of the recommendations provided with the performance of the behaviors to promote. For example, questions about the type and intensity of physical activity performed and the amount and frequency of consumption of each of the foods included in the behavioral objectives will be included. 2.3.4 Statistical analyses: The distribution of the data will be analyzed with the Kolmogorov Smirnov test. Descriptive analysis will be performed, including means, standard deviations, and medians. Next, the effects of the program on the selected variables will be assessed by comparing them between evaluations and between groups with t‐student tests for paired and unpaired data, respectively, if a normal distribution is found. For no normally distributed data, the Wilcoxon test (repetitive measures) and the U de Mann Whitney test (independent groups) will be used. For no categorical variables, the chi‐squared test will be used. Correlation analyses will also be performed, considering Pearson correlation for normally distributed data and Spearman correlations for no normally distributed data. Likewise, simple, and multiple linear regression models will be carried out, as well as binary logistic regression analysis reporting odds ratios, to identify relationships and risks between variables. Statistical analysis will be performed at the STATA V12® program. 2.4 Ethical and biosafety considerations: This project has been already evaluated and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Center for Studies and Research in Behavior, of the University Center for Biological and Agricultural Sciences (CUCBA) from the University of Guadalajara with the number CUCBA/CEIC/CE/002/2022 and by the Technical Research Committee of the University Center of the South (CUSUR), with the number 2021D001. This protocol is also registered on Clinical Trials.gov (ID: NCT05457439). When performing the intervention, the Declaration of Helsinki and biosafety protocols of the Secretary of Health of Mexico will be followed all the time. All participants will sign an informed consent and their identities will be protected by the Federal Law on Protection of Personal Data Held by Private Parties. Both due to regulations in research with human beings, and due to the situation of the COVID‐19 pandemic, a strict biosafety protocol will be followed, where mouth covers will be always worn, both by the evaluating staff and by the participants. Likewise, the sample collection personnel will wear protective glasses and sterile gloves and constant disinfection of the work area will be carried out. In addition, hazardous biological waste will be disposed of in a special trash can in accordance with the provisions of the Ministry of Health. 3. Discussion: By developing this program, the first bases for the Mexican population (and future populations) to achieve a healthy and sustainable diet will be generated. Which can have positive effects on health outcomes and decrease the environmental impact of food consumption; thus addressing two of the main problems afflicting the world population. Also, a new concept is being proposed: The Sustainable‐Psycho‐Nutrition, which is an approach based on behavioral science that integrates the psychological, social, cultural, economic, nutritional, and environmental aspects of eating behavior, whose objective is to generate the necessary bases to carry out behavioral change interventions, to guide the eating behavior of the population, towards sustainable eating behaviors. Within this term, the nutritional‐ecological education concept is also being launched, whose objective is to get people to acquire and performed the appropriate behavioral repertoire to determine what, how much, when, and how to eat, in relation to when, how much, and how energy is spent to maintain or recover their physical well‐being, considering at all times the environmental impact of their behaviors and selecting the most sustainable foods, regarding the environment, culture, economy, preferences, food security, health, nutrition, among other factors. Besides those aspects, the mobile application that is currently being developed is going to be a tool that will facilitate the promotion of sustainable diets first at the national level in Mexico, and forward, worldwide. Also, the first sustainable food guide for Mexico's context will be generated. Which will consider not only sustainability aspects but psychological and behavioral aspects. Moreover, the workshops, recipes, and food plans that are going to be created will serve as tools for the health and environmental sector of the country to promote the consumption of sustainable diets. Finally, the link between gut microbiota and sustainable diets is a new aspect that this study will be characterized for the first time, specifically for the Mexican population. Finally, this project intends to bring attention to the importance of considering behavioral interventions and techniques for promoting sustainable diets.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT05457439,,,Trial registry record,Acanthosis Nigricans; Hypercholesterolemia; Hyperglycemia; Hypertriglyceridemia,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02423832/full,

In approximately 90‐95% of children, it is of functional origin i.e., without an identifiable organic pathology. It accounts for 3% of pediatric outpatient visits and 25% of referrals to a pediatric gastroenterologist. Prevalence rates ranging from 0.7% to 29.6% with a median of 8.9% have been described in the older literature, with a higher prevalence in Asian population. However, in a recent study, using the Rome IV criteria, the pooled global prevalence of pediatric functional constipation is found to be 14.4% (95%CI: 11.2‐17.6). Severe longstanding constipation is distressing for the entire family and poses a substantial psychological, social, and educational strain on the child's development. Thirty to seventy‐five percent of children with functional constipation also have fecal impaction. It typically begins after several bouts of painful bowel movements, which triggers a vicious cycle of fear‐induced stool‐withholding behavior leading to more stool retention. Consequently, a significant amount of feces accumulates in the rectum forming a big fecal mass or fecaloma, causing a variety of complaints, including gastrointestinal discomfort, excessive flatulence, nausea or vomiting, poor appetite, mood swings & irritability. European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) & the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) position paper on pediatric constipation defines fecal impaction as any one of the following: i) palpation of a hard mass in the lower abdomen on physical examination, ii) a dilated rectum filled with a large amount of stool on rectal examination, iii) abdominal radiography showing excessive stool in the distal colon. The treatment strategy for functional constipation includes fecal disimpaction and maintenance therapy to ensure regular bowel movements. ESPGHAN & NASPGHAN guidelines emphasize that maintenance therapy remains ineffective until disimpaction has been achieved. If initial disimpaction is skipped, oral laxative therapy may paradoxically worsen fecal incontinence/encopresis attributable to overflow diarrhea. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) based laxatives have been recommended as the first‐line therapeutic agents for both disimpaction as well as maintenance therapy in childhood functional constipation. PEG, a biologically inert polymer of the formula H(OCH2CH2)nOH in which n is 68‐84. These are non‐absorbable polymers, that create an osmotic gradient in the intestinal lumen leading to fluid retention which in turn softens and loosens the stool. Hence, they act as osmotic laxatives. As it does not carry any electrical charge, it does not influence the movement of any other solutes. The commonly used formulations are PEG 3350 with a molecular weight between 3200 and 3700 g/mol and PEG 4000 with an approximate molecular weight of 4000 g/mol. Both are shown to be effective in pediatric constipation management in placebo‐controlled trials. However, there is scanty literature available comparing other aspects of various PEG formulations, such as tolerability, palatability, & convenience of administration, which may affect treatment adherence and thus the ultimate treatment outcome. PEG + Electrolyte (E) is more widely used than PEG for the management of constipation. This might be because of the perception that PEG + E is safer in terms of preventing electrolyte imbalance. However, several head‐to‐head trials using different PEG formulations in adult constipation patients, showed comparable efficacy and safety. Because of the inclusion of electrolytes, PEG+E tastes saltier than PEG. Many patients struggle to tolerate the unpleasant taste resulting in the high incidence of non‐compliance and treatment failure . Two studies from the adult population have demonstrated better acceptance of PEG in comparison to PEG+E . In fact, the latest meta‐analysis concluded that the addition of electrolytes to PEG does not provide any clinical benefits over PEG alone. In a recent double‐blind RCT, PEG 4000 is found to be equally efficacious and safe as PEG 3350 + E as a long‐term maintenance therapy in children with functional constipation . However, they have not described the tolerability or acceptability data of the cohort. There is only a single pediatric study that showed, PEG 4000 is equally effective and had a higher patient acceptance rate owing to significantly lesser nausea, vomiting episodes, and better palatability compared to PEG 3350. However, both these studies are majorly focused on the comparison between PEG 3350 + E versus PEG 4000 as a long‐term maintenance therapy in pediatric functional constipation. There is only a single study that compared PEG 3350 versus PEG 3350 only laxative for fecal disimpaction. Both of them were found to almost equally effective in resolution of fecal impaction, however PEG 3350 + E group had significantly higher side effects as compared to PEG 3350 only laxative. To date, no pediatric trials have compared PEG versus PEG+E on a head‐to‐head basis for the treatment of the initial but most important & crucial step of pediatric function constipation management i.e. Fecal disimpaction. Since fecal disimpaction requires administration of a significantly larger volume of PEG administration, palatability becomes a major factor determining the success of disimpaction. On the other hand, there is also of higher possibility of side effects like electrolyte & acid base imbalances because of higher purge rate during disimpaction. Comparison of both these parameters namely tolerability/palatability and safety/side effects profile of PEG versus PEG + E during fecal disimpaction in pediatric population has not been studied previously. Therefore, the present study has been planned with an aim to evaluate the efficacy & tolerability of PEG 4000 versus PEG 3350+ electrolytes for fecal disimpaction in paediatric functional constipation.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT06349031,,,Trial registry record,Constipation; Fecal Impaction,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02685372/full,

METHODS: A population‐based retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify risk factors associated with acute gastroenteritis. Indirect surveillance data were used to estimate the extent and the resolution of the epidemic. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 140 randomly selected individuals of whom 22 met the illness case definition (15.7% attack rate). The epidemic curve was similar to the evolution of antidiarrheal products sold by the only pharmacy in town and calls made to the Health Info Line. Bivariate analysis led to identifying five risk factors of gastrointestinal illness: consumption of municipal water, contact with someone with acute gastroenteritis (within and outside of the household), contact with a child in daycare, and being less than 35 years of age. Drinking municipal water had the highest risk ratio (RR = 24.31; 95% CI = 1.50‐393.4). Drinking water from a private artesian well was a protective factor (RR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.09‐0.90).

Point‐of‐use water treatment technologies provide effective and low‐cost solutions to reduce exposure to enteropathogens from drinking water, but it is unknown whether the use of these technologies translates to improvements in child growth. We conducted a community‐based randomized controlled trial of two water treatment technologies to estimate their effects on child growth in Limpopo, South Africa. We randomized 404 households with a child younger than 3 years to receive a silver‐impregnated ceramic water filter, a silver‐impregnated ceramic tablet, a safe‐storage water container alone, or no intervention, and these households were followed up quarterly for 2 years. We estimated the effects of the interventions on linear and ponderal growth, enteric infections assessed by quantitative molecular diagnostics, and diarrhea prevalence. The silver‐impregnated ceramic water filters and tablets consistently achieved approximately 1.2 and 3 log reductions, respectively, in total coliform bacteria in drinking water samples. However, the filters and tablets were not associated with differences in height (height‐for‐age z‐score differences compared with no intervention: 0.06, 95% CI: ‐0.29, 0.40, and 0.00, 95% CI: ‐0.35, 0.35, respectively). There were also no effects of the interventions on weight, diarrhea prevalence, or enteric infections.

Evidence‐based guidance is needed to improve interventions and remove barriers to diarrheal disease reduction. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate how sensitive WASH intervention effectiveness was to underlying contextual and intervention factors in the WASH Benefits (WASH‐B) Bangladesh cluster‐randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The investigators measured diarrheal prevalence in children enrolled in the WASH‐B trial at three time points approximately 1 year apart (n=17,187 observations). We developed a susceptible‐infectious‐susceptible model with transmission across multiple environmental pathways and evaluated each of four interventions [water (W), sanitation (S), hygiene (H), and nutrition (N) applied individually and in combination], compliance with interventions, and the impact of individuals not enrolled in the study. Leveraging a set of mechanistic parameter combinations fit to the WASH‐B Bangladesh trial using a hybrid Bayesian sampling‐importance resampling and maximum‐likelihood estimation approach, we simulated trial outcomes under counterfactual scenarios to estimate how changes in six WASH factors (preexisting WASH conditions, disease transmission potential, intervention compliance, intervenable fraction of transmission, intervention efficacy, and community coverage) impacted intervention effectiveness. RESULTS: Increasing community coverage had the greatest impact on intervention effectiveness (e.g., median increases in effectiveness of 34.0 and 45.5 percentage points in the WSH and WSHN intervention arms when increasing coverage to 20%). The effect of community coverage on effectiveness depended on how much transmission was along pathways not modified by the interventions. Intervention effectiveness was reduced by lower levels of preexisting WASH conditions or increased baseline disease burden. Individual interventions had complementary but not synergistic effects when combined. DISCUSSION: To realize the expected health gains, future WASH interventions must address community coverage and transmission along pathways not traditionally covered by WASH. The effectiveness of individual‐level WASH improvements is reduced more the further the community is from achieving the coverage needed for herd protection. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP15200.",132,12,127003,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 39705040,EMBASE 646113494,,,,Journal article,"*Diarrhea [epidemiology, prevention & control]; *Hygiene; *Sanitation [methods]; *diarrhea; *hygiene; *sanitation; Bangladesh; Bayes Theorem; Bayes theorem; Child, Preschool; Controlled study; Epidemiology; Female; Human; Humans; Infant; Male; Preschool child; Prevention and control; Procedures; Randomized controlled trial; Water Supply [statistics & numerical data]; Water supply",10.1289/EHP15200,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02793723/full,

However, much of the world's population lacks access to adequate and safe water. Approximately 884,000, 000 people in the world still do not get their drinking water from safe sources; Sub‐Saharan Africa accounts for over one third of this number. It is estimated that 80% of all illnesses in the world are related to use of unsafe and contaminated water. Methods: A cross‐sectional study was conducted from August 1st 2017 to July 30th 2018 in three randomly selected woreda (districts) of Eastern Zone Tigrai. Water samples were examined for total coliforms and thermotelorant coliforms using the most probable number method. Standard biochemical testing was performed on samples that tested positive to identify the genus of bacteria. The contaminant risk of water sources were assessed using the sanitary inspection checklist of the World Health Organization. The results were interpreted using World Health Organization guidelines for drinking water quality. Data was collected using laboratory checklist and sanitary inspection check list. It was entered, cleared and analyzed using SPSS version 21.0 and a variable having a P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant in all tests. Results: A total of 290 drinking water samples were analyzed for bacteriological quality. A total of 32.4% (n = 94) of water sources showed contamination with faecal and total coliforms. Of these 3.4% (n = 10) samples were contaminated with total coliforms and 29% (n = 84) contaminated with faecal coliforms. The leading water contaminant organisms were Escherichia coli (62.4%), Legionella species (8.5%), and Shigella species (7.5%) respectively. Based on WHO criteria, 15% of water sources were grouped in the very high risk group. Animal excreta and inadequate fencing of water sources were significantly associated with water contamination rate. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that most water sources in woredas of Eastern Tigrai are contaminated by faecal coliforms. Therefore, regular sanitary inspection, bacteriological analysis, and adequate fencing should be mandatory to protect drinking water sources from faecal contamination.",6,1,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 632722341,,,,Journal article,*bacteriological quality; *microbiological parameters; *water quality; Article; Bacterial count; Biochemical analysis; Coliform bacterium; Controlled study; Cross‐sectional study; Environmental sanitation; Escherichia coli; Ethiopia; Fecal coliform; Heat tolerance; High risk population; Legionella; Microbiological examination; Most probable number method; Nonhuman; Priority journal; Protection; Pseudomonas; Risk factor; Shigella; Water analysis; Water contamination; Water sampling; Water standard; Water supply; World Health Organization; Yersinia,10.1186/s40794-020-00116-0,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02193304/full,

We assessed the effectiveness of thermal and chemical interventions on sinks contaminated with MDRO in the hospital setting. METHODS: We conducted a cross‐sectional assessment of MDRO contamination of sinks and toilets in 26 clinical wards of a tertiary care hospital. MDRO‐contaminated sink traps were then replaced and randomized (1:1:1) to receive chemical (sodium hypochlorite), thermal disinfection (steam), or no intervention. Interventions were repeated weekly for 4 weeks. Sinks were resampled 7 days after the last intervention. The primary outcome was the proportion of decontaminated sinks. MDROs of interest were extended spectrum beta‐lactamase (ESBL) producing and carbapenemase‐producing Enterobacterales, and non‐fermentative Gram‐negative bacilli. RESULTS: In the cross‐sectional assessment, at least one MDRO was identified in 258 (36%) of the 748 samples and in 91 (47%) of the 192 water sources. In total, 57 (42%) of the 137 sinks and 34 (62%) of the 55 toilets were contaminated with 137 different MDROs.

We examined the impact of an urban school‐based WASH programme (Project WISE) on child health and attendance. METHODS: The WISE cluster‐randomised trial, conducted in 60 public primary schools in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia over one academic year, enrolled 2‐4 randomly selected classes per school (  100 pupils) from grades 2 to 8 (aged 7‐16) in an 'open cohort'. Schools were assigned 1:1 by stratified randomisation to receive the intervention during the 2021/2022 or the 2022/2023 academic year (waitlist control). The intervention included improvements to drinking water storage, filtration and access, handwashing stations and behaviour change promotion. Planned sanitation improvements were not realised. At four unannounced classroom visits post‐intervention (March‐June 2022), enumerators recorded primary outcomes of roll‐call absence, and pupil‐reported respiratory illness and diarrhoea in the past 7 days among pupils present. Analysis was by intention‐to‐treat. RESULTS: Of 83 eligible schools, 60 were randomly selected and assigned. In total, 6229 eligible pupils were enrolled (median per school 101.5; IQR 94‐112), 5987 enrolled at study initiation (23rd November‐22nd December 2021) and the remaining 242 during follow‐up. Data were available on roll‐call absence for 6166 pupils (99.0%), and pupil‐reported illness for 6145 pupils (98.6%). We observed a 16% relative reduction in odds of pupil‐reported respiratory illness in the past 7 days during follow‐up in intervention vs. control schools (aOR 0.84; 95% CI 0.71‐1.00; p = 0.046). There was no evidence of effect on pupil‐reported diarrhoea in the past 7 days (aOR 1.15; 95% CI 0.84‐1.59; p = 0.39) nor roll‐call absence (aOR 1.07; 95% 0.83‐1.38; p = 0.59). There was a small increase in menstrual care self‐efficacy (aMD 3.32 on 0‐100 scale; 95% CI 0.05‐6.59), and no evidence of effects on other secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This large‐scale intervention to improve school WASH conditions city‐wide had a borderline impact on pupil‐reported respiratory illness but no effect on diarrhoeal disease nor pupil absence.

This cluster‐randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effects of a school garden programme and complementary nutrition, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions on children's health and nutritional status in two districts of Nepal. METHODS: The trial included 682 children aged 8‐17 years from 12 schools. The schools were randomly allocated to one of three interventions: (a) school garden programme (SG; 4 schools, n = 172 children); (b) school garden programme with complementary WASH, health and nutrition interventions (SG+; 4 schools, n = 197 children); and (c) no specific intervention (control; 4 schools, n = 313 children). The same field and laboratory procedures were employed at the baseline (March 2015) and end‐line (June 2016) surveys. Questionnaires were administered to evaluate WASH conditions at schools and households. Water quality was assessed using a Delagua kit. Dietary intake was determined using food frequency and 24‐h recall questionnaire. Haemoglobin levels were measured using HemoCue digital device and used as a proxy for anaemia. Stool samples were subjected to a suite of copro‐microscopic diagnostic methods for detection of intestinal protozoa and helminths. The changes in key indicators between the baseline and end‐line surveys were analysed by mixed logistic and linear regression models. RESULTS: Stunting was slightly lowered in SG+ (19.9 to 18.3%; p = 0.92) and in the control (19.7 to 18.9%). Anaemia slightly decreased in SG+ (33.0 to 32.0%; p < 0.01) and markedly increased in the control (22.7 to 41.3%; p < 0.01), a minor decline was found in the control (43.9 to 42.4%). Handwashing with soap before eating strongly increased in SG+ (from 74.1 to 96.9%; p = 0.01, compared to control where only a slight increase was observed from 78.0 to 84.0%). A similar observation was made for handwashing after defecation (increase from 77.2 to 99.0% in SG+ versus 78.0 to 91.9% in control, p = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: An integrated intervention consisting of school garden, WASH, nutrition and health components (SG+) increased children's fruit and vegetable consumption, decreased intestinal parasitic infections and improved hygiene behaviours.

Narrowing this time window of association can help determine whether the mechanism linking rainfall and relative humidity to sporadic LD is direct or indirect. Due to the large number of daily water interactions and low incidence of LD, we propose a new Bayesian modeling approach to disentangle the potential for a direct versus indirect exposure to precipitation. METHODS: Incubation period distributions were used to redistribute LD cases to their estimated day of exposure. Then Bayesian distributed lag models were fit to estimate cases per day of exposure with predictor variables for rainfall and absolute humidity. Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of relatively humidity, rainfall after the estimated date of exposure, and randomized rainfall to validate our results. RESULTS: One standard deviation increase in rainfall 2 and 3 days prior to the date of estimated exposure was associated with an approximately 15% increase in LD risk (per day). When heavy rainfall occurred 0 to 3 days prior to estimated exposure, risk increased by more than 40%, peaking at a 51% increased risk of LD 2 days after heavy rainfall. DISCUSSION: Our findings of a 2‐ and 3‐day lag between rainfall and the date of estimated exposure is consistent with an indirect link with rainfall, rather than a same‐day exposure. Potential pathways that can indirectly link rainfall to LD cases include rainfall‐mediated declines in public water supplies, but greater environmental sampling research is needed.",231,6,1502‐1511,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 39689015,EMBASE 646087644,,,,Journal article,*Infectious Disease Incubation Period; *Legionella; *Legionnaires' Disease [epidemiology]; *Rain; *incubation time; *legionellosis; *legionnaire disease; *pneumonia; *rain; *weather; Article; Bayes Theorem; Controlled study; Human; Humans; Humidity; Incidence; Major clinical study; Precipitation; Predictor variable; Sensitivity analysis; Water supply,10.1093/infdis/jiae625,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02820767/full,

This study evaluates the impact of a social behavior change communication (SBCC) program on water quality and hygiene practices in northern Uganda. Methods: A three‐arm cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) ‐ the One Nutrition in Complex Environments (ONCE) study ‐ evaluated the Nutrition Impact and Positive Practice (NIPP) program and an enhanced (NIPP+) program with added exposure to WASH and agricultural technologies compared to controls in households with children under‐2. Data were collected pre‐ and post‐intervention for 3 arms (n=900). Water was collected at households and community sources on a random subsample (n=360). E. coli were quantified with membrane filtration (CFU/100 mL) and converted to a binary indicator (<=10 | >10 CFU/ 100 ml).We computed an overall WASH score (out of 13) with 13 positive WASH indicators. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to generate effect estimates, adjusting for social‐demographic characteristics,water source characteristics and contamination, and baseline contamination. Results: NIPP and NIPP+ participants had higher probability of boiling water, cleaning water containers, and having a hand washing facility compared to controls at endline. They also had higher cumulative WASH knowledge and practice scores. There was no difference in effects by socioeconomic status or education. Therewas no significant difference in risk of E. coli contamination for NIPP compared to control. However, NIPP+ had a 24% lower risk (RR=0.76; p=0.02) of having E. coli in water compared to control. If all households had the NIPP+ intervention, fewer (49%) would have E. coli contaminated water than with no intervention (64%). Conclusions: Improvements in WASH knowledge and practices were reported for intervention households, along with a reduced risk of E. coli for NIPP+. While the NIPP+ intervention reduced contamination, about 50% of NIPP+ households still used contaminated water. Further analysis to determine the specific aspects responsible for contamination risk reduction and subsequent effects on malnutrition is needed.

Household water treatment with chlorine significantly reduces morbidity due to waterborne diseases. However, the effect of point‐of‐use (POU) water treatment in improving the quality of water in areas where POU is not provided free of charge and the effectiveness of home visits in inspiring household members to use POU regularly have not been studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of drinking water disinfection by chlorination on diarrheal disease reduction among children under the age of 5 years in rural eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A cluster randomized controlled trial was carried out in rural Dire Dawa from October 2018 through January 2019. The 405 households were randomized to intervention and control arms and intervention materials were distributed after conducting a baseline survey. This trial evaluated the effectiveness of household drinking water disinfection by chlorination in reducing incidence of diarrhea among children under the age of 5 years. Intervention households received 1.2% sodium hypochlorite with demonstration of its proper use. Participants in the control households continued with their usual habits of water collection and water storage. Generalized estimation equation (GEE) with log link Poisson distribution family and exchangeable correlation matrix was used to compute crude incidence rate ratio (IRR), adjusted IRR and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: In the intervention households, in total, 281 cases of diarrhea were documented (8.7 cases per 100 person‐weeks observation); in the control households, in total 446 cases of diarrhea were documented (13.8 cases per 100 person‐weeks observation). A 36.0% (adjusted IRR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.57‐0.73) reduction in incidence of diarrhea was observed in the intervention arm when compared with the control arm. The highest and the lowest reductions were obtained in children of age ranges 1 to 2 years and 3 to 4 years, 42.7 and 30.4%, respectively. Adherence to the intervention was 81.3% as measured by free residual chlorine test. CONCLUSIONS: In rural areas where diarrhea is the second leading cause of morbidity, water chlorination at the household level using liquid bleach considerably reduced episodes of diarrhea among children under the age of 5 years. Therefore, chlorinating drinking water at the household level may be a valuable interim solution for reducing the incidence of diarrheal diseases until potable water is made accessible to the majority of the population in Dire Dawa Administration and other Ethiopian communities.

We examined the impact of an urban WASH in schools programme (Project WISE) on child health and attendance. Methods The WISE cluster‐randomised trial, conducted in 60 public primary schools in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia over one academic year, enrolled 2–4 randomly selected classes per school (approximately 100 pupils) from grades 2–8 (aged 7–16) in an 'open cohort'. Schools were assigned 1:1 by stratified randomisation to receive the intervention during the 2021/22 academic year or the 2022/23 academic year (waitlist control). Masking was not possible. The intervention included improvements to drinking water storage, filtration and access, alongside handwashing stations and behaviour change promotion. Planned improvements to sanitation facilities were not realised. At four unannounced classroom visits between March and June 2022 (post‐intervention, approximately every four weeks), enumerators recorded primary outcomes of roll‐call absence, and pupil‐reported respiratory illness and diarrhoea in the past seven days among pupils present.

While chlorinated drinking water is generally considered safe, the antimicrobial effects of chlorine‐based disinfectants may negatively impact the developing infant microbiota, which is particularly vulnerable during this critical period. This study investigates the specific effects of chlorinated water on the gut microbiome in infants. Methods: The waTer qUality and Microbiome Study (TUMS) is a double‐blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). Six‐month old infants (n=197) received either de‐chlorinated drinking water (via benchtop filtration), or regular tap water for twelve months. Stool samples were collected at six‐months (baseline) and at eighteen‐months of age. Metagenomic sequencing was used for faecal microbiome analysis. Samples of participant tap water was also collected pre‐ and post‐intervention. Results: Participants were balanced for sex, delivery method, and breast‐feeding status at time of recruitment between the control (n=98) and treatment (n=99) groups. We collected a total of 170 baseline stool samples (83 in the control group and 87 in the treatment group), and 130 follow‐up stool samples (65 in the control group and 65 in the treatment group). Interindividual variation was higher at six‐months compared to eighteen months. No significant differences in overall community structure (beta diversity (p=0.35), richness (p=0.98) or Shannon Index (p=0.45)) were found between treatment groups. However, 55 genera were differentially abundant at follow‐up (adjusted p‐value < 0.01), primarily within the Firmicutes phylum. Analysis of metabolic pathways revealed the chlorinated water group showed significantly higher abundance of antibiotic resistance genes mostly attributable to Escherichia and Klebsiella species. Conclusion: Water chlorination induces predominantly minor changes in infant gut microbiome composition; but appears to increase the abundance of antibiotic‐resistant genes. While water chlorination remains a vital public health tool for ensuring safe drinking water, our findings underscore the need for continued research into the potential for increased antibiotic resistance and suggest there may be value in exploring alternative disinfectant strategies.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 2034988770,,,,Preprint,*antibiotic resistance; *chlorination; *disinfection; *drinking water; *intestine; *intestine flora; *metagenomics; *microflora; *water; *water quality; Antimicrobial activity; Breast feeding; Community structure; Controlled study; Dysbiosis; Escherichia; Firmicutes; Follow up; Human; Infant; Klebsiella; Microbiome; Nonhuman; Phylum; Preprint; Randomized controlled trial; Shannon index; Tap water,10.1101/2024.09.15.24313601,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02774573/full,

Here, we evaluated the presence and concentration of culturable extended‐spectrum β‐lactamase (ESBL)‐Escherichia coli and ESBL‐KESC (Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia, and Citrobacter spp.) in the feces of 479 Bangladeshi children <5 years of age enrolled in a double‐blind, randomized controlled trial of in‐line drinking water chlorination. The trial, conducted in 2015 in two low income urban communities in Bangladesh, demonstrated significant reductions in diarrheal disease. We detected ESBL‐E. coli and ESBL‐KESC in the feces of 64.5% (n=309) and 11.7% (n=56) of children, respectively.

Bangladeshi children are often exposed to diarrheal pathogens and antibiotics, which perturb normal microbiome development. A cluster randomized controlled trial in two low‐income communities in Dhaka found that point‐of‐collection drinking water chlorination reduced diarrheal disease by 23% and recent antibiotic consumption by 7% among children under five. We leveraged stool samples collected one year after initiation of the intervention to examine whether drinking water chlorination also impacted children's gut microbiota, including the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) they harbored. We performed metagenomic short‐read sequencing on fecal DNA from 95 randomly selected treatment and control children aged 6‐61 months. We classified the taxonomy of raw reads and identified ARGs using ResFinder. We examined group differences in genera richness and relative abundance of genera and ARGs while controlling for age and study site. Groups will be unblinded when analysis is complete. The impacts of drinking water chlorination on children's gut microbiota differed by age. Specifically, children in Group B whose gut microbiomes were likely developing (age <31 months, n =16) had at least 2‐fold higher abundance of genera containing known pathogens (Shigella spp. and Helicobacter spp.) than similarly aged Group A children (n=17). Their microbiomes were also more likely to harbor the blaCTX‐M‐15 ESBL gene, which confers 3rd generation cephalosporin resistance, than Group A children. Meanwhile, children in Group B over ≥ 31 months (n=33) had lower abundance of Akkermansia spp., which are associated with reduced inflammation, than Group A children (n=29). Drinking water chlorination increased the taxonomic richness of younger but not older children's gut microbiota. Overall, a cluster randomized drinking water treatment intervention that reduced children's diarrhea and antibiotic consumption in urban Bangladesh also impacted the composition of children's gut microbiomes and whether they harbored the blaCTX‐M‐15 ESBL gene, but impacts differed by age.",103,5 SUPPL,460,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 637502628,,,,Journal article; Conference proceeding,*Bangladesh; *chlorination; *intestine flora; Akkermansia; Antibiotic resistance; Cephalosporin resistance; Child; Clinical article; Clinical trial; Conference abstract; Controlled study; Diarrhea; Feces; Female; Helicobacter; Human; Human tissue; Infectious agent; Inflammation; Male; Metagenomics; Nonhuman; Preschool child; Randomized controlled trial; Shigella; Taxonomy,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02387846/full,

We aimed to evaluate the digestive tolerability and acceptability of Fibersol‐2 in healthy and diarrheal children, as well as improvement in stool consistencies in young diarrheal children. METHODS: Sixty children of either sex, aged 1‐3 years having four groups (healthy children/low dose, healthy children/high dose, children with diarrhea/low dose and children with diarrhea/high dose) were enrolled into this exploratory study between 1st August to 23rd October 2017. Two presumptive doses, low (2.5g) and high (5g), twice daily with 50 ml drinking water for seven days were the interventions. Outcomes were to observe the development of possible abdominal symptoms, such as pain, distension, rumbling, and bloating during the intervention and post‐intervention periods in healthy and diarrheal children as well as improvement in stool consistencies in diarrheal children. RESULTS: Among the diarrheal children, the median (IQR) duration of resolution of diarrhea was 3.9 (2.9, 5.1) days vs. 3.5 (2.0, 8.0) days, p = 0.885; in low dose and high dose groups, respectively. Significant difference was observed in terms of abdominal pain (27% vs. 7%, p = 0.038) and distension (40% vs. 0%, p<0.001) in diarrheal children, compared to healthy children during the pre‐intervention period. We also observed significant difference in respect of abdominal distension (23% vs. 0%, p = 0.011), rumbling (27% vs. 0%, p = 0.005) and bloating (43% vs. 3%, p = 0.001) in diarrheal children, compared to healthy children during the intervention period. However, no significant difference was observed in relation to abdominal pain (p = 0.347) and distension (p = 0.165) during the pre‐intervention period, compared to the intervention period in diarrheal children. Moreover, no significant difference was observed during the post‐intervention period for the diarrheal and healthy children.

Few studies have concurrently assessed their associations with health outcomes, particularly among people living with HIV. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the associations between FI and WI and how they relate to physical and mental health. METHODS: Food‐insecure adult smallholder farmers living with HIV in western Kenya were recruited to participate in a cluster‐randomized controlled trial of a multisectoral agricultural and asset loan intervention. We used baseline data on experiences of FI (using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale, range: 0‐27) and WI (using a modified scale developed for this region, range: 0‐51) in the prior month (n = 716). Outcomes included probable depression (using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist), fatigue and diarrhea in the prior month, and overall mental and physical health (using the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey, range: 0‐100). We first assessed Pearson correlations between FI, WI, and sociodemographic characteristics. We then developed 3 regressions for each health outcome (control variables and FI; control variables and WI; control variables, FI, and WI) and compared model fit indexes. RESULTS: Correlations between household FI, WI, and wealth were low, meaning they measure distinct constructs. FI and WI were associated with numerous physical and mental health outcomes; accounting for both resource insecurities typically provided the best model fit. For instance, when controlling for FI, each 10‐point higher WI score was associated with a 6.42‐point lower physical health score (P < 0.001) and 2.92 times greater odds of probable depression (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Assessing both FI and WI is important for correctly estimating their relation with health outcomes. Interventions that address food‐ and water‐related issues among persons living with HIV concurrently will likely be more effective at improving health than those addressing a single resource insecurity.

METHODS: Analysis of patient‐level data from 2 multicenter randomized, placebo controlled trials conducted in pediatric emergency departments in Canada and the United States. Participants were 3‐48 months with >3 diarrheal episodes in the preceding 24 hours and were symptomatic for <72 hours and <7 days in the Canadian and US studies, respectively. Participants received either placebo or a probiotic preparation (Canada‐Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011/Lactobacillus helveticus R0052; US‐L. rhamnosus GG). The primary outcome was post‐intervention moderate‐to‐severe disease (ie, ≥9 on the Modified Vesikari Scale [MVS] score). RESULTS: Pathogens were identified in specimens from 59.3% of children (928/1565). No pathogen groups were less likely to experience an MVS score ≥9 based on treatment allocation (test for interaction = 0.35). No differences between groups were identified for adenovirus (adjusted relative risk [aRR]: 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI]: .62, 3.23), norovirus (aRR: 0.98; 95% CI: .56, 1.74), rotavirus (aRR: 0.86; 95% CI: .43, 1.71) or bacteria (aRR: 1.19; 95% CI: .41, 3.43).

Specific Objectives: 1. To evaluate and compare clinical responses (duration of diarrhea, stool output, ORS intake, and clinical success) in infants and young children suffering from acute non‐cholera watery diarrhea treated with standard Glucose‐based WHO ORS and amino acid‐based ORS ""VS002A"". 2. To evaluate and compare electrolyte imbalance as possible complications in infants and young children suffering from acute non‐cholera watery diarrhea treated with standard Glucose‐based WHO ORS and amino acid‐based ORS ""VS002A"". Background of the Project including Preliminary Observations: Diarrheal disorders constitute a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, and continue to be a major concern particularly for developing countries (Platts‐Mills, 2015; WHO/UNICEF, 2013;Bern, 1992). Estimates show that in the year 2010, globally there were 1.7 billion episodes of diarrhea and 7.6 million deaths in children less than 5 years of age, mostly in the developing world; 72% of the deaths occurred in the first 2 years of life (Liu, 2012, 2015; Walker, 2013). In the Southeast Asian region, diarrhea is responsible for more than 20% of the total deaths among infants and young children (Liu, 2012, 2015). Acute infectious diarrheal diseases are caused by a number of microbial pathogens. The bacterial pathogens include Vibrio cholerae, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Shigella, Salmonella, and Campylobacter. Rotavirus is the most prominent viral diarrheagenic pathogen and also the leading cause of infantile diarrhea, whereas Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidia are the important parasites causing diarrhea. Based upon the pathogenetic mechanisms, these organisms may be broadly divided into two groups ‐ secretory and invasive. V. cholerae is the prototype pathogen causing secretory diarrhea through liberation of an enterotoxin which stimulates intestinal secretion via intracellular accumulation of cyclic AMP (Fasano, 2002). There is insignificant inflammation or structural change in the intestinal mucosa and the diarrhea is watery in nature. Sufficient loss of fluids and electrolytes leads to dehydration, and thus the mainstay of treatment of patients with acute infectious secretory diarrhea is fluid replacement. On the other hand, Shigella (the prototype invasive pathogen) invades the gut mucosa and induces an inflammatory reaction, producing a dysenteric illness (Levine, 1982). The amount of fluid loss is minimal, and antibiotics are generally required in their management. In the developing countries, recent studies show that the commonest attributable microbial causes of moderate‐to‐severe diarrheal illnesses in infants and young children are: rotavirus, Cryptosporidium, enterotoxigenic E. coli producing heat‐stable toxin (ST‐ETEC, with or without co‐expression of heat‐labile enetrotoxin), and Shigella (Kotloff, 2013; Liu, 2016). The standard clinical intervention in acute watery diarrhea is the use of oral rehydration solution (ORS), continued feeding, and oral zinc supplementation (WHO/UNICEF, 2013; WHO, 1995). The development of ORS for the treatment of dehydration due to diarrhea is one of the most significant therapeutic advances in the history of medicine. It is based upon the observations that even in a secreting small intestine it is possible to achieve a positive gut balance of fluid and electrolytes by adding glucose to the salt solution (Pierce, 1968; Fordtran, 1975). ORT is now recognized as a major scientific advance of utmost practical importance. The ORT solution currently recommended by the WHO/UNICEF contains glucose, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and trisodium citrate dehydrate, which is optimal for rehydration of patients of all ages with dehydration from acute diarrhea of any etiology. It is estimated that ORS alone can successfully rehydrate 90% of patients with dehydration from acute diarrhea who previously would have required intravenous therapy therapy (Hirschorn, 1991). However, ORT with the present ORS formulation has certain limitations ‐ it does not reduce the volume, frequency or the duration of diarrhea (Mahalanabis, 1996). This is a constraint on the acceptance of ORT as a treatment of diarrhea, since the mothers and the health‐care providers expect earlier recovery and a reduced severity of the disease, which is partly responsible for the widespread use of ineffective (and often harmful) antibiotics and other anti‐diarrheal agents. These limitations prompted the development of the concept of improved ORS (initially termed 'super ORS') (Mahalanabis, 1986). Conceptually, an improved ORS should be able to reduce stool volume (by enhancing better reabsorption of fluid secreted into the small intestine), shorten duration of diarrhea (by reducing ileal effluent flow and stimulating colonic salvage), and reduce failure rate of ORT in patients with high purging rate. Several strategies were used to develop and test improved ORS ‐ including the use of amino acids in addition to glucose, replacing glucose with glucose‐polymers, using cereals instead of glucose, adding non‐absorbable fermentable products to the ORS, and making the ORS hypo‐osmolar by reducing both glucose and sodium concentrations. The recently recommended hypo‐osmolar ORS is the result of intense search for such an improved ORS. Though the new hypo‐osmolar ORS is more efficacious than the previously standard ORS, the duration of diarrhea is still not shortened, and there are failures with ORT (Alam, 1999). Thus, there is scope for further improvements of ORT. The ORS takes advantage of the glucose‐coupled intestinal sodium transport mechanism across the luminal membrane by the protein sodium glucose co‐transporter 1 (SGLT1). Although nutrient independent sodium absorption across the intestinal epithelial brush border membrane is impaired in diarrhea, co‐transport of sodium and glucose is preserved. This allows absorption of sodium and thus water as provided by oral rehydration solutions (Figure 1). Key in the success of use of ORS for rehydration is the fact that these physiological processes stay intact, even in the setting of severe diarrhea. However, although ORS substantially enhances glucose‐stimulated sodium absorption and correction of dehydration, it does not significantly decrease stool output, which is one of the main reasons for underutilization of ORS (Greenough, 1993; Wagner, 2015). Although an adequate explanation for this has not been established, it could be explained if glucose also stimulated anion secretion. In fact, based upon in vitro studies on the effect of glucose on active chloride and fluid secretion in mouse small intestinal cells and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco‐2) cells, glucose not only enhanced sodium absorption via SGLT1, a well‐established phenomenon, but also stimulated active electrogenic chloride secretion via an increase in intracellular Ca2+ (Yin, 2014, AJP Cell). In clinical or experimental conditions, glucose‐stimulated chloride secretion is most likely to occur in the villous cell region. These observations raise the possibility that in those clinical conditions in which there is villous damage and impaired glucose‐stimulated sodium absorption, glucose may have deleterious effects on overall fluid and electrolyte movement by virtue of its stimulation of active chloride secretion. In young children with acute non‐cholera watery diarrhea, the rate of treatment failure due to clinically evident glucose intolerance is generally expected to be around 2% (Santosham M, 1982). However, 30% of young Peruvian children with acute diarrhea had detectable glucose malabsorption leading to treatment failure in 7% of the patients (Salazar‐Lindo E, 1986). Thus, it may be hypothesized that simple dietary modifications and/or changes in the ORS formulation, such that glucose is replaced with compounds that do not stimulate chloride secretion, could significantly alter the outcome of the disease process. Since certain neutral amino acids (e.g. glycine, L‐alanine, L‐glutamine) are also able to enhance the absorption of sodium ions and water, one approach to developing an improved ORS formulation was based on adding neutral amino acids or their dipeptides to WHO‐ORS (Mahalanabis, 1983). The first studies of glycine‐containing ORS were inconclusive; a meta‐analysis of seven clinical trials conducted later showed that the ORS formulations containing glucose (or maltodextrin) and glycine (or glycyl‐glycine) were not clinically superior to the standard WHO‐ORS (International Study Group on Improved ORS, 1991). A summary of the eight clinical trials comparing L‐alanine containing ORS with the WHO‐ORS also showed variable results; in general, the differences in children with non‐cholera diarrhea were not statistically significant (Bhan, 1994). Three clinical trials comparing glutamine‐containing ORS with the WHO‐ORS showed that it does not have any clinical advantage in children with non‐cholera diarrhea (Bhan, 1994). One common thing among all the trials is that all the experimental amino acid‐containing ORSs also contained glucose in variable amounts (9 g/L to 20 g/L); also most of these solutions had relatively high osmolarity (320 ‐ 400 mosmol/L). One study which compared glucose‐free glutamine‐containing ORS with the WHO‐ORS showed similar efficacy in children with acute non‐cholera diarrhea (Gutierrez, 2007); it is to be noted that glutamine behaves like glucose in stimulating anion secretion (Yin, 2014). In a study comparing L‐isoleucine supplemented glucose‐containing ORS with WHO‐ORS in young children with acute diarrhea, the differences were not statistically significant (Alam, 2011). However, in adult patients suffering from severe cholera, L‐histidine‐supplemented ORS was found superior to a histidine‐free ORS; both the experimental and control solutions were rice‐based and glucose‐free (Rabbani GH, 2005). In another study, a glucose‐free peptilose‐based ORS was found more advantageous and acceptable than the WHO‐ORS for treatment of mostly acute watery diarrhea among children (Simakachorn, 1993). Previous studies on VS002: Entrinsic Bioscience, a small business formed from intellectual property from the University of Florida (UF), developed a sugar‐free, shelf‐stable amino acid‐based hydration medicinal food that effectively rehydrates, and improves barrier function of the bowel following infections targeting the gastrointestinal tract (GI). VS002's proprietary formulation of select amino acids contains no glucose. Studies in humans and animals demonstrate that sugar‐free VS002 is an effective rehydration solution in a variety of circumstances. Irradiation increases paracellular permeability in the gut with associated nutrient malabsorption, fluid imbalance, and bacterial translocation. In addition, irradiation induces active chloride ion secretion and fluid loss, and reduces transport of many carbohydrates, proteins and electrolytes. In a series of studies with radiation‐induced enteritis with associated villus atrophy, an optimal composition of a novel ORS was defined based upon the observations that the inclusion of specific amino acids caused tightening of the mucosal barrier and reversal of symptoms of radiation‐induced enteric dysfunction (Yin, 2014). VS002 thus consists of only the amino acids that improve electrolyte and water absorption and correct the increased gut permeability noted following irradiation and infectious disease. It has been observed that certain amino acid‐based pathways for sodium transport become the dominant pathway to compensate during times of stress. These pathways can be utilized to rehydrate the intestinal epithelial cells and restore normal bowel function. Eight specific amino acids retained their absorptive capacity from the gut lumen following radiation and at the same time decreased paracellular permeability: Lysine, Aspartic acid, Glycine, Isoleucine, Threonine, Tyrosine, Valine, and Serine. Studies with VS002 have shown that VS002 administration i) rapidly rehydrates to increase fluid and electrolyte absorption, ii) tightens the mucosal barrier, thus decreasing local and systemic inflammation, and iii) increases crypt count and villus height, leading to an increase in the surface area of absorption. There is no toxicity associated with VS002 administration and the results of studies in animals and humans suggest that VS002 can serve as a highly safe and effective supportive care in place of standard ORS (Yin, 2014; Cheuvront, 2018; Clarke, 2018; Sollanek, 2018). Results of In Vivo Studies Irradiated mice: Irradiated mice were treated either with saline or with VS002 for 14 days. Treatment with VS002 reduced mortality, preserved body weight, decreased pica (indication of nausea), and improved electrolyte and nutrient absorption (Yin, 2014; 2017) Mice with Rotavirus enterotoxin: Mice were exposed to rotavirus enterotoxin (NSP4) and sections of gut were tested for transport in vitro, and glucose‐coupled sodium transport was found significantly impaired along with increased chloride secretion in the presence of NSP4. Glucose in the presence of NSP4 further increased the chloride secretion (Yin, 2017) Healthy Humans: Trials in healthy humans demonstrated i) VS002 safety; and ii) rehydration efficacy compared to a variety of commercial, glucose‐containing beverages (sports drink, ORS). These studies included adults with diarrhea, healthy soldiers, young college students, and older adults (> 60 years old). Thus, administration of VS002 using eight amino acids to increase intestinal water and electrolyte absorption was associated with safe rehydration. See below for further study details. VS002 was provided to > 250 adults treated for diarrhea in Indonesia and the Philippines. The consumption of VS002 was well tolerated by all subjects, with no adverse events (Olveda, 2016; Abdulah, 2018). A study in healthy U.S. Soldiers and civilians (n = 26, males and females) examined the effect of rehydration via a common sports drink or VS002 after a bout of hypertonic or isotonic dehydration (3‐4% body mass). Rehydration via VS002 resulted in improved rehydration of the extracellular space compared to the common sports drink, as well as greater fluid retention in the VS002 group (p < 0.05). The consumption of VS002 was well tolerated by all subjects, with no adverse events (Cheuvront, 2018). Another study evaluated the ability of VS002 to optimize hydration compared to water in healthy adults (n = 40, males and females). Consumption of VS002 resulted in improved retention compared to water (p < 0.05). The consumption of VS002 was well tolerated by all subjects, with no adverse events (Sollanek, 2018). The ability of VS002 to optimize hydration was also compared in younger and older adults (n = 24, males and females). Consumption of VS002 resulted in improved retention compared to water (p < 0.05). The consumption of VS002 was well tolerated by all subjects, with no adverse events (Clarke, 2019). In a randomized, double‐blind study to evaluate the efficacy of VS002, 587 adult patients received either WHO‐ORS or VS002 to treat diarrhea. Safety results revealed that no patient consuming VS002 experienced any serious adverse events, whereas a small number of patients taking WHO‐ORS did. Efficacy data for clinical cure rates were not clinically or statistically significant between treatment groups. Therefore, it is hypothesized that VS002 will also be superior to WHO‐ORS in the treatment of acute watery non‐cholera diarrhea in infants and young children. Advanced Amino acid‐based ORS: VS002A Traditional oral rehydration solutions (ORS) contain sugars which stimulate intestinal sodium and water absorption through a variety of mechanisms. However, it has been under‐appreciated that traditional ORS possess no anti‐diarrheal functions and may exacerbate infectious diarrheal secretions (Yin et al., 2017). Safety data of Advanced amino acid based ORS: VS002A The food additive amino acids may be safely used as nutrients added to foods as individual amino acids in the free, hydrated, or anhydrous form, or as the hydrochloride, sodium, or potassium salts: (1) L‐Alanine; (2) L‐Arginine; (3) L‐Asparagine; (4) L‐Aspartic acid; (5) L‐Cysteine; (6) L‐Cystine; (7) L‐Glutamic acid; (8) L‐Glutamine; (9) Aminoacetic acid (glycine); (10) L‐Histidine; (11) LIsoleucine; (12) L‐Leucine; (13) L‐Lysine; (14) DL‐Methionine (not for infant foods); (15) LMethionine; (16) L‐Phenylalanine; (17) L‐Proline; (18) L‐Serine; (19) L‐Threonine; (20) LTryptophan; (21) L‐Tyrosine; (22) L‐Valine. EBS amino acid formulas are fully compliant with FDA 21 CFR requirements. Gut health biomarkers Although oral rehydration therapy has greatly reduced diarrhoea‐associated mortality, burden of diarrheal disease still persists in children below 5 years who are living under unsanitary condition and limited public health resources. This contributes to 43% of stunted growth and impaired cognitive development, affecting one‐fifth of children worldwide and one‐third of children in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) (Guerrant, 2013; Kosek, 2013). Vicious cycle of enteric infection and malnutrition often leads to enteropathy for extended periods of time in young children when adequate water and sanitation are lacking (Guerrant, 2013; Owino, 2016). This type of enteropathy is known as Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED). EED, previously known as tropical enteropathy or environmental enteropathy, is a sub‐acute inflammatory condition of the small intestinal mucosa of unknown etiology (Ramakrishna, 2006). It is characterized by structural changes in the small intestine including villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia compromising nutrient absorption and pathogenic barrier (increased permeability and inflammatory cell), impaired gut immune function, malabsorption, growth faltering, and generally asymptomatic, as distinct from diarrheal disease (Owino, 2016; Sullivan, 1991). Data are limited from LMICs including Bangladesh on inflammatory and pathological changes in the gut wall like EED among children with diarrhea. In this study we will study plasma Citrulline (CIT) concentration as potential marker of functional enterocyte mass and absorptive functions of intestine, and Tryptophan‐Kyanurenine (KT) ratio as a marker of gut inflammation. CIT is an amino acid produced by intestinal epithelial cells and found lower in patients with enteropathy. One animal study reported lower plasma CIT level in the neonatal calves with diarrhea compared to healthy control (Gultekin, 2019). Tryptophan (TRP), a plant‐derived essential amino acid (EAA) is needed to support growth and health in humans. In response to infection, TRP is mostly catabolized by an enzyme indoleamine 2,3‐dioxygenase (IDO) to a toxic metabolite kynurenine (KYN).

Fungal contamination of such waterlines has not been extensively studied, compared with bacterial contamination. This study aimed at assessing the magnitude and risk factors for fungal contamination of dental unit waterlines. Methodology: This cross‐sectional study included 82 dental units, randomly collected from 3 private clinics and 8 governmental hospitals in Alexandria, Egypt. A total of 204 water samples from dental unit waterlines output were membrane‐filtered and cultured for fungal enumeration and species identification. The biofilm forming‐ability was assessed for the most prevalent fungal species. The acceptability of samples was determined according to the Swedish drinking water guidelines. Results: The acceptability of samples was 89.7%. The most common mould was Aspergillus flavus, while Candida spp. was the most common yeast (10 isolates), with unusual predominance of Candida dubliniensis (9 isolates). All isolates of Aspergillus flavus and Candida dubliniensis were biofilm‐formers. The risk factors for fungal contamination of dental unit waterlines included: Dental specialty (p = 0.042), time of sample collection (p < 0.001), older age of dental unit (p < 0.001) and use of 5‐15% of sodium hypochlorite. Conclusions: The presence of biofilm‐forming fungi in dental unit waterlines is a potential hazard, even when samples have acceptable levels of fungal counts.

Community‐based interventions may reduce complementary‐food contamination and disease rates. CONCLUSIONS: We found that low‐cost and culturally embedded behaviour change interventions were acceptable to communities and led to short‐ and long‐term improvements in complementary‐food safety and hygiene practices, and reported diarrhoea and acute respiratory tract infections. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered on the 17th October 2014 with the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry in South Africa with number (PACTR201410000859336) and 32‐month follow‐up as an amendment to the trial. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A public health intervention using critical control points and motivational drivers, delivered February‐April 2015 in The Gambia, was evaluated in a cluster randomised controlled trial at 6‐ and 32‐month follow‐up in September‐October 2015 and October‐December 2017, respectively. After consent for trial participation and baseline data were collected, 30 villages (clusters) were randomly assigned to intervention or control, stratified by population size and geography. The intervention included a community‐wide campaign on days 1, 2, 17, and 25, a reminder visit at 5 months, plus informal community‐volunteer home visits. It promoted 5 key complementary‐food and 1 key drinking‐water safety and hygiene behaviours through performing arts, public meetings, and certifications delivered by a team from local health and village structures to all villagers who attended the activities, to which mothers of 6‐ to 24‐month‐old children were specifically invited. Control villages received a 1‐day campaign on domestic‐garden water use. The background characteristics of mother and clusters (villages) were balanced between the trial arms. Outcomes were measured at 6 and 32 months in a random sample of 21‐26 mothers per cluster. There were no intervention or research team visits to villages between 6 and 32 months. The primary outcome was a composite outcome of the number of times key complementary‐food behaviours were observed as a proportion of the number of opportunities to perform the behaviours during the observation period at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the rate of each recommended behaviour; microbiological growth from complementary food and drinking water (6 months only); and reported acute respiratory infections, diarrhoea, and diarrhoea hospitalisation. Analysis was by intention‐to‐treat analysis adjusted by clustering. (Registration: PACTR201410000859336). We found that 394/571 (69%) of mothers with complementary‐feeding children in the intervention villages were actively involved in the campaign. No villages withdrew, and there were no changes in the implementation of the intervention. The intervention improved behaviour adoption significantly. For the primary outcome, the rate was 662/4,351(incidence rate [IR] = 0.15) in control villages versus 2,861/4,378 (IR = 0.65) in intervention villages (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 4.44, 95% CI 3.62‐5.44, p < 0.001), and at 32 months the aIRR was 1.17 (95% CI 1.07‐1.29, p = 0.001). Secondary health outcomes also improved with the intervention: (1) mother‐reported diarrhoea at 6 months, with adjusted relative risk (aRR) = 0.39 (95% CI 0.32‐0.48, p < 0.001), and at 32 months, with aRR = 0.68 (95% CI 0.48‐0.96, p = 0.027); (2) mother‐reported diarrhoea hospitalisation at 6 months, with aRR = 0.35 (95% CI 0.19‐0.66, p = 0.001), and at 32 months, with aRR = 0.38 (95% CI 0.18‐0.80, p = 0.011); and (3) mother‐reported acute respiratory tract infections at 6 months, with aRR = 0.67 (95% CI 0.53‐0.86, p = 0.001), though at 32 months improvement was not significant (p = 0.200).

Even if many schoolchildren in Ethiopia are anemic and stunted, few have studied the co‐existence of anemia and stunting among schoolchildren in Ethiopia. In addition, multilevel analysis to explore the variation in prevalence of concurrent anemia and stunting (CAS) across schools and classes is rarely applied. Thus, we aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of CAS at the individual, household, and school level among schoolchildren in southern Ethiopia. Methods. We recruited 864 students aged 7–14 years from the Wonago district in southern Ethiopia using a three‐stage random sampling, assigning four schools to level one, 24 classes to level two. We then randomly selected 36 children from each class, and recorded their weight, height, haemoglobin, intestinal helminthic infections, hygienic practices, dietary practices, household food insecurity, and socio‐demographic information. A multivariate, multilevel logistic regression model was applied to detect potential risk factors for CAS. Results. The prevalence of CAS was 10.5% (85/810) among schoolchildren, which increased with age in years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.39 [95% confidence interval 1.13, 1.71, P = 0.002]) and among children who always did not wash their hands with soap after use of latrine (aOR 4.30 [1.21, 15.3, P = 0.02]). Children who walked barefoot (aOR 10.4 [2.77, 39.1, P = 0.001]), were infected with Trichuris trichiura (aOR 1.74 [1.05, 2.88, P = 0.03]), or had head lice infestation (aOR 1.71 [1.01, 2.92, P = 0.04]) had higher CAS prevalence. Prevalence rates of CAS were low in those using treated drinking water (aOR 0.32 [95% CI 0.11, 0.97, P = 0.04]). Most of the risk factors for CAS were identified at the individual level. The clustering effect measured by the intra‐cluster correlation coefficient was 6.8% at school level and 19% at class. Conclusion. CAS prevalence is a moderate public health problem among schoolchildren in southern Ethiopia and varies across classes and schools. After controlling for clustering effects at the school and class levels, we found an association between CAS and increasing age, not always washing hands with soap after using latrine, walking barefoot, and T. trichiura infection. Using treated water for drinking was found to have a protective effect against CAS. Thus, educating children on personal hygiene and provision of safe drinking water could reduce the CAS burden in schoolchildren in rural areas of southern Ethiopia.",9,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 2011989709,,,,Journal article,*anemia; *stunting; Age; Article; Ascaris lumbricoides; Child; Cross‐sectional study; Diet; Dietary intake; Dietary pattern; Female; Food insecurity; Hand washing; Health care facility; Human; Hygiene; Major clinical study; Male; Pediculosis capitis; Prevalence; Quality control; Risk factor; Sanitation; School child; Trichuriasis; Trichuris trichiura; Water treatment,10.7717/peerj.11158,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02273890/full,

Methods We leveraged the Early Life Interventions for Childhood Growth and Development in Tanzania (ELICIT) trial, a randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial of antimicrobial therapy with azithromycin and nitazoxanide provided quarterly to infants from 6 to 15 months of age. We tested 5,479 stool samples at time points across the study for 34 enteropathogens using quantitative PCR. Results There was substantial carriage of enteropathogens in stool. Azithromycin administration led to reductions in Campylobacter jejuni/coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, and Shigella/EIEC (absolute risk difference ranged from ‐0.06 to 0.24) 2 weeks after treatment however there was no effect after 3 months.

The objective of the Preventative Intervention for Cholera for 7 Days (PICHA7) program is to develop evidence‐based water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions to reduce cholera and other severe diarrheal diseases in the DRC. The study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of PICHA7 program delivery in increasing handwashing with a cleansing agent at stool/vomit‐ and food‐related events in a healthcare facility setting among diarrhea patients and patient attendants.

The Wells and Enteric disease Transmission trial is the first randomised controlled trial to estimate the burden of disease that can be attributed to the consumption of untreated private well water. To estimate the attributable incidence of gastrointestinal illness (GI) associated with private well water, we will test if the household treatment of well water by ultraviolet light (active UV device) versus sham (inactive UV device) decreases the incidence of GI in children under 5 years of age. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The trial will enrol (on a rolling basis) 908 families in Pennsylvania, USA, that rely on private wells and have a child 3 years old or younger. Participating families are randomised to either an active whole‐house UV device or a sham device. During follow‐up, families will respond to weekly text messages to report the presence of signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal or respiratory illness and will be directed to an illness questionnaire when signs/symptoms are present. These data will be used to compare the incidence of waterborne illness between the two study groups. A randomly selected subcohort submits untreated well water samples and biological specimens (stool and saliva) from the participating child in both the presence and absence of signs/symptoms. Samples are analysed for the presence of common waterborne pathogens (stool and water) or immunoconversion to these pathogens (saliva). ETHICS: Approval has been obtained from Temple University's Institutional Review Board (Protocol 25665). The results of the trial will be published in peer‐reviewed journals.

This study was aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of E. coli O157:H7 related to diarrhea among under‐five children with acute diarrhea. Methods A cross‐sectional study design was carried out in 2018 on 378 under‐five‐year children recruited randomly from hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia. Stool specimens were collected and processed using enrichment, differential and selective medium. Among isolates, E. coli O157:H7 was confirmed using latex test (Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hants, England). Factors associated with E. coli O157:H7 infection were identified using binary and multivariable logistic regression. Associations were reported by odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Results The prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 related diarrhea was 15.3% (95%CI: 11.8–19.5). The E. coli O157:H7 infection was positively associated with rural residence (AOR;3.75, 95% CI:1.26–11.20), consumption of undercooked meat (AOR;3.95, 95%CI: 1.23–12.67), raw vegetables and/or fruit juice (AOR;3.37, 95%CI:1.32–8.62), presence of bloody diarrhea (AOR;4.42, 95% CI:1.78–10.94), number of under‐five children in a household (AOR;7.16, 95%CI: 2.90–17.70), presence of person with diarrhea in a household (AOR;4.22, 95% CI: 1.84–12.69), owning domestic animal (AOR;3.87, 95% CI: 1.48–10.12) and uneducated mother (AOR;3.14, 95%CI: 1.05–9.42). Conclusion The Prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 related diarrhea among under‐five children is relatively high in Eastern Ethiopia.

Subjects were randomly assigned to a whey hydrolysate placebo group, a low‐dose WPC group or a high‐dose WPC group. After 2 weeks of consumption, subjects (n = 121) were orally infected with a high dose of live but attenuated diarrheagenic E. coli (strain E1392/75‐2A; 1E10 colony‐forming units). Subjects recorded information on stool consistency and the frequency and severity of symptoms in an online diary. The primary outcome parameters were a change in stool frequency (stools per day) and a change in Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) diarrhea score between the first and second days after infection. Neither dose of the whey protein concentrate in the dietary treatment affected the E. coli‐induced increase in stool frequency or GSRS diarrhea score compared to placebo treatment. The composition of the microbiota shifted between the start of the study and after two weeks of consumption of the products, but no differences between the intervention groups were observed, possibly due to dietary guidelines that subjects had to adhere to during the study.

Interventions that simultaneously address several risk factors at the household level have great potential to reduce these negative effects. We present the design and baseline findings of a cluster‐randomised controlled trial to evaluate the impact of an integrated home‐environmental intervention package and an early child development programme to improve diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections and childhood developmental outcomes in children under 36 months of age living in resource‐limited rural Andean Peru. METHODS: We collected baseline data on children's developmental performance, health status and demography as well as microbial contamination in drinking water. In a sub‐sample of households, we measured indoor kitchen 24‐h air concentration levels of carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and CO for personal exposure. RESULTS: We recruited and randomised 317 children from 40 community‐clusters to four study arms. At baseline, all arms had similar health and demographic characteristics, and the developmental status of children was comparable between arms. The analysis revealed that more than 25% of mothers completed primary education, a large proportion of children were stunted and diarrhoea prevalence was above 18%. Fifty‐two percent of drinking water samples tested positive for thermo‐tolerant coliforms and the occurrence of E.coli was evenly distributed between arms. The mean levels of kitchen PM2.5 and CO concentrations were 213 μg/m3 and 4.8 ppm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The trial arms are balanced with respect to most baseline characteristics, such as household air and water pollution, and child development. These results ensure the possible estimation of the trial effectiveness. This trial will yield valuable information for assessing synergic, rational and cost‐effective benefits of the combination of home‐based interventions.

Health benefits were estimated as the value of averted mortality due to diarrheal disease and the cost of illness arising from averted diarrheal morbidity. We also estimated the value of time savings from avoided open defecation and use of neighbours’ latrines. Intervention delivery costs were estimated top‐down based on financial records, while recurrent costs were estimated bottom‐up from trial data. We explored methodological and parameter uncertainty using one‐way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Avoided mortality accounted for 58% of total benefits, followed by time savings from increased access to household latrines.

The unit of intervention was school, and 180 randomly chosen schools out of total of 204 primary schools were stratified according to the school type—government primary school (GPS) and registered non‐government primary school (RNGPS). A cross‐cutting HE‐ SP treatments were then randomly assigned to 180 schools stratified by two school‐type stratified. Thus, four groups (HE, SP, HESP, and control) with 45 school each were randomly chosen using Excel random classification formula by the author who was also the principal investigator. The process was repeated until statistical nondifference of baseline school characteristics between the groups was ensured. Children surveyed were chosen randomly using seat placement based on the pre‐determined randomly selected seat numbers prescribed by the author. Surveyors were masked about the treatment status in both baseline and endline surveys. The baseline survey was conducted before the intervention in September–December 2011, and the endline data were collected in April–August 2013, after the completion of the intervention (March 2012–March 2013). The randomisation was done in January 2012 after the beginning of academic year in Bangladesh, thus the treatment status should not have affected the choice of school by the children and their families.

Observational studies have revealed associations between household flooring and health outcomes, but robust experimental evidence is scant. This study will evaluate the impact of an improved household flooring intervention on enteric infections, soil‐transmitted helminth (STH) infections and tungiasis through implementation of a cluster‐randomised trial in two rural settings in Kwale and Bungoma Counties, Kenya. METHODS AND ANALYSES: 440 clusters (households) across both sites are allocated to control or intervention group, in which a low‐cost, sealed, washable, cement‐based floor is installed in eligible buildings of the dwelling, alongside a floor‐care guide provided during an induction meeting. Following baseline assessments in both groups, all individuals over 1 year receive albendazole and those infected with tungiasis receive benzyl benzoate. Primary outcomes are as follows: prevalence of enteric infections in children under 5 years assessed via stool surveys and PCR; prevalence of tungiasis infection in children 1‐14 years based on clinical exam; and prevalence of STH infection in all household members over 1 year assessed via Kato‐Katz. Secondary outcomes include the following: intensity of STH and tungiasis infections; prevalence of caregiver‐reported gastrointestinal illness in children under 5; quality of life and well‐being measures; and environmental contamination. A process evaluation investigates intervention acceptability, durability, practicality and cost. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has been approved by ethics committees of The Kenya Medical Research Institute, The Kenya National Commission for Science Technology and Innovation, and The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Following the 12‐month implementation period and final assessments, control households are offered improved floors. Results will be disseminated within Kenya, to the Ministries of Health and of Lands, Public Works, Housing and Urban Development, and to subnational leadership and communities. Dissemination will also occur through publications and conference presentations.

However, achieving high adoption and sustained use of safe storage is challenging. Systematic adaptation can address these challenges by improving contextual fit while retaining core functionality to protect water quality. We applied Plan‐Do‐Study‐Act (PDSA) cycles to systematically adapt a safe water storage container (SWSC) intervention for implementation in rural Burkina Faso. This study describes the adaptation process and the impacts of the SWSC on Escherichia coli contamination in household stored water in a cluster‐randomized trial with 49 intervention villages (274 households) and 50 no‐intervention control villages (290 households). SWSC adoption among intervention households was high (88.9%). The intervention achieved approximately a 0.4 log reduction in E. coli contamination. Intervention impact was likely moderated by differential changes in improved source use across intervention and control households. Safe storage improves water quality when used consistently.

Factors such as diet, sanitation, and living conditions play a role in the prevalence of helminthic diseases. Many individuals remain asymptomatic carriers. Timely intervention is essential to prevent these infections. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective, randomized intervention study that enrolled 52 participants, excluding children, all of whom had parasitic infections. A prevalidated questionnaire was given to assess the risk factors for parasitic diseases, and fecal examinations were conducted to identify parasitic infestations. The World Health Organization’s hand hygiene self‐assessment framework was used to evaluate handwashing skills. Subsequent posttesting and resampling of patients allowed for score comparison, assessment of reductions in parasitic load, determination of cure rates, and monitoring of patient readmission rates. Results: After the health education intervention, a statistically significant improvement (P < 0.01) was observed in patients’ knowledge and attitudes toward parasitic infections, as shown by their posttest scores compared to their pretest scores. In addition, there were notable improvements in handwashing skills following the implementation of the handwashing educational program.

Although the impacts of coccidian infection are significant among HIV/AIDS infected cases, proper diagnosis and management of coccidian infection is limited in sub‐Saharan Africa including Ethiopia. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of coccidian parasitic infections among HIV/AIDS cases before and after commencement of antiretroviral treatment. Methods: An institution‐based longitudinal study was conducted among 304 randomly selected HIV/AIDS cases from February to July 2018 before and after commencement of antiretroviral therapy. A structured questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic and associated factors data. Stool and blood samples were collected before and three months after treatment. Coccidian detection and CD4+ count were conducted via modified acid fast stain technique and fluorescence‐activated cell scanning, respectively. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics were used to compute coccidian prevalence. Logistic regression was used to compute possible association between associated factors and coccidian parasitic infection. Variables with P<0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results: Among 304 HIV/AIDS cases, prevalence of coccidian parasitic infection before and after antiretroviral treatment was 23.4% and 8.9%, respectively. Prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. (19.7%) and Isospora belli (4.3%) before antiretroviral treatment were higher than Cryptosporidium spp. (7.9%) and Isospora belli (1.0%) after treatment.

Definition 2. Incidence 3. Pathophysiology 4. Clinical features 5. Complications 6. Management 2‐ Muscle strength and sickle cell anemia 3‐ Health related quality andsickle cell anemia 1. Sickle cell anemia 1. Definition It is an inherited hemoglobinopathy caused by a single amino acid substitution at the sixth residue of the beta (β)‐globin subunit, which results in the production of the characteristic Hemoglobin S. It is induced by β‐globin gene mutation and influences millions of people worldwide. The disease primarily affects the development of red blood cells, resulting in the formation of hemoglobin ‐S (is an abnormal type of hemoglobin which causes RBCs to become sickle‐shaped and inflexible, this is usually the most severe form of the disease. These abnormal cells clump together in the arteries blocking blood flow to various organs and hence cause various complications. Sickle cell anemia is considered a genetic disorder, distinguished by Vaso‐occlusive crises (VOCs) and hemolytic anemia. 2. Incidence This disease is most common in India, sub‐Saharan Africa, and the Mediterranean area, but is also detected in wider Americas and Europe. About 100,000 people in the United States and millions more across the world suffer from sickle cell anemia, SCD occurs among about 1 out of every 365 Black or African American births. SDC occurs among about 1 out of every 16,300 Hispanic American births. About 1 in 13 Black or African American babies is born with sickle cell trait. The incidence of sickle cell disease increased from 4.62 to 4.65% globally, reaching 5.46 million individuals in 2021. Sadly, the illness kills about 300,000 children under the age of five every year‐five times more than other causes of death. To put things in perspective, there were roughly 4,400 sickle cell‐related fatalities worldwide in 2021. Nevertheless, the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023 (GBD 2023) appears to have significantly underestimated these figures, as it was unable to fully capture their scope. In the Caribbean and sub‐Saharan Africa, the impact is even more profound due to the high prevalence of the trait in these regions. For instance, the Caribbean saw an increase in sickle cell disease‐related mortality from 425,000 to 515,000. These figures underscore the critical need for enhanced data collection and reporting methods to ensure accurate tracking and management of sickle cell disease globally. 3. Pathophysiology Hemoglobin S displays biochemical characteristics): when hemoglobin S is deoxygenated, it crystallizes together with related polymers, causing the structure of red blood cells to distort (the recognizable sickle shape). Increased red blood cell density, Hemoglobin S polymerization that causes red blood cells to become irreversibly sickled, a fall in cell ion and water content (cell dehydration), and cyclic deoxygenation are all related to cyclic deoxygenation. First, ischemic/reperfusion damage is brought on by microvascular blockages in capillaries and small vessels due to the sickle cells' enhanced adhesiveness. Vaso‐occlusive events in microcirculation are the result of a complicated scenario that is still only partially understood. This scenario involves interactions between various cell types, including leukocytes, platelets, plasma factors, abnormally activated endothelial cells, dense red blood cells, and reticulocytes. the local reduction in nitric oxide bioavailability. Extra‐ and intra‐vascular hemolytic disease are caused by either the red blood cells' increased stiffness and resulting in reduced deformability, which results in either their evacuation by macrophages (liver or spleen) or their destruction inside the circulation. When thymine replaces adenine in the beta globin gene's sixth codon, valine (a hydrophobic amino acid) is produced instead of glutamic acid, which is hydrophilic, leading in SCA. Despite that, all people with sickle cell anemia have the same genetic mutation; each patient's clinical history is very different. 4. Clinical features The symptoms of SCA can vary from person to another and can change over time. The early symptoms are yellowish skin color (jaundice), whites of eyes (icterus), extreme tiredness, painful swelling of hands and feet (dactylitis). There are recent studies that mention that there are three most frequent symptoms including fatigue, bone aches, and headaches. 67% rated the severity of symptoms with fatigue, in the array of ""severe"" to ""worst imaginable Likert score 5‐7. In case of bone aches and headache, the severity was valued by 67% and 54% of patients. Psychological symptoms were also predominant, with 38% and 39% of patients suffering anxiety and depression. 5. Complications Some complications may be systemwide (affect many parts of the body at the same time), others affect specific parts. According to Pinto et al., 2019, Complications affecting the whole body may include: ‐ Acute pain crisis: Also called Vaso‐occlusive crisis It occurs without warning, when sickled cells lock blood flow. People describe that pain as sharp, intense, stabbing, or throbbing. Common areas affected by that pain include the abdomen, chest, lower back, arms, or legs. ‐ Vitamin deficiency: People with SCA are at a high risk for nutrient and vitamin deficiency specially vitamin D, omega 3, vitamin C, and zinc that can also causes a crisis or complications. ‐ Chronic long‐term pain: Chronic pain is common, but it can be hard to describe. It is always different from crisis pain the results from organ damage. ‐ Delayed growth and puberty: Because of the resulting anemia, children with SCA may grow and develop more slowly than their peers. ‐ Infections: Because of the damaged spleen, the risk for certain infections is higher in patients with sickle cell anemia. Including chlamydia, H. influenza type B, salmonella, and staphylococcus. ‐ Joint problems sickling in the hip bones and, less commonly, the shoulder joint, knees, and ankles can reduce oxygen flow and result in a condition called avascular or aseptic necrosis which severely damage the joints. The symptoms include pain, problems with walking and joint movement. ‐ Blood clots: Change in how the blood travels through blood vessels can result in blood clots. Swelling of arms or legs, pain or tenderness not caused by injury, sudden shortness of breath, weakness in specific areas of the body, changes in thinking maybe some signs of blood clotting. ‐ High blood pressure: People with sickle cell anemia can develop high blood pressure, increase the workload of the heart and blood vessels, and worsen high‐risk complications like stroke and kidney diseases. ‐ Serious anemia complications: Severe anemia in a newborn or a child who has a sickle cell anemia may be a result of one of two conditions; Aplastic crisis: is usually caused by Parvovirus B19 infection which is also called slapped chick syndrome. Parvovirus B19 can cause the bone marrow to stop producing new red blood cells for a while leading to severe anemia. Or splenic sequestration crisis: most commonly occurs in newborns and children who have sickle cell anemia. Patients with SCA who are exposed to malaria are at a higher risk of sickle cell crisis and death Williams and Obaro, 2011 and have a greater danger of pneumococcal disease especially children younger than 5 years, diarrheal disease, and infections in bone associated with Vaso‐occlusive crisis. The Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers Clinical Trial Consortium exhibits the occurrence of different complications such as sickle cell pain and asthma, as well as cumulative age noticeably lessened scores in the vitality domain (i.e., were allied with elevated incidence of fatigue. 6. Management of sickle cell anemia Current management of SCA focuses primarily on the maintenance of health and treatment of acute and chronic complications. Several important modalities such as hydroxyurea therapy and blood transfusion have been found to boost patient outcomes. Hydroxyurea therapy reduces the frequency of vasooclusive crisis and acute splenic sequestration crisis, acute chest syndrome therapy reducing the need for blood transfusions and associated hospitalizations, while stem cell transplantation is the intervention that most likely to be curative in nature. However, this option is often associated with several complications. Hematopoietic stem‐cell transplantation and gene therapy can cure SCA but require significant healthcare resources and can have severe health consequences. As of 2021, only six centers in Africa offer transplantation, while 215 centers in the USA can perform transplants National Marrow Donor Program. High‐resource settings may provide better care, but there is room for improvement in quality care and further research is needed to understand the factors contributing to negative outcomes in SCA. 2. Muscle strength and sickle cell anemia Child's overall health, play activity, and quick movement in an emergency, it is crucial to maintain optimal muscle function throughout childhood. To perform something, anaerobic exercise is frequently required. Furthermore, kids often perform brief bursts of vigorous movement while they are playing. Because of this, a child's daily life can benefit from anaerobic activity patterns.A study to examine maximal muscle strength and peak power in children with sickle cellanemia found that maximal muscle strength and peak power are significantly less inchildren with sickle cell anemia compared to the control group. Children with SCAfrequently have poor growth and nutritional status, increased protein turnover, decreasedlean body mass, and elevated resting and lower activity energy expenditures. There is asevere lack of empirically supported information regarding anerobic performance among thefew exercise research comparing children with sickle cell anemia to healthy childrenbecause most of these studies concentrated on aerobic performance.Children with SCA often exhibit reduced muscle strength and endurance, which can furthercompromise their physical functioning and overall quality of life. Impact on MuscleFunction: The chronic hemolytic anemia characteristic of SCA leads to reduced oxygendelivery to tissues, including muscles. This, combined with recurrent Vaso‐occlusivecrises, can contribute to muscle weakness and reduced exercise tolerance.Objective measures of muscle strength, such as hand‐held dynamometry, have shown thatchildren with SCA have significantly lower muscle strength compared to healthy controls.These findings underscore the importance of incorporating muscle strength assessment andtargeted interventions in the management of children with SCA.Physical therapy and tailored exercise programs can help improve muscle strength,endurance, and overall physical function in children with SCA. Such programs need to becarefully designed to avoid triggering pain crises while promoting physical health andimproving quality of life.Sickle cell anemia significantly impacts the health‐related quality of life and musclestrength in children. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approachthat includes medical management, physical rehabilitation, and psychological support toimprove outcomes and enhance the quality of life for children living with this chroniccondition. Future research should continue to explore innovative interventions andsupport mechanisms to mitigate the impact of SCA on children's physical and emotionalwell‐being.Assessment of muscle strength Muscle strength testing is a crucial part of diagnosingchildren with neurological and musculoskeletal dysfunctions. Objective muscle strengthmeasurements provide baseline data and information about the pace of improvement.Commonly used clinical techniques for assessing muscle strength include manual muscletesting, Lafayette dynamometry, and hand‐held dynamometry.Manual muscle test Grades for a manual muscle test are recorded as numeric ordinal scoresranging from zero (0), which represents no discernable muscle activity, to five (5),which represents a maximal or best possible response or as great a response as can beevaluated by a manual muscle test. The numeric 0 to 5 system of grading is the most usedfor muscle strength scoring convention across health care professions. Each numeric gradecan be paired with a word grade that describes the test performance in qualitative, butnot quantitative, terms.Lafayette handheld dynamometer Lafayette Hand‐Held Dynamometer (L‐HHD) is a valid andproven assessment tool used for objectively quantifying muscle strength. It is the idealinstrument for documenting medical necessity for tracking the progress duringrehabilitation or a strength training program.The Lafayette HHD features a wide range of customizable options for data storage, forceovertime graphs, preset test times, and force thresholds. It includes three stirrups withan algometer attachment, users guide, battery charger, sanitary covers, and carryingcase. Clinically, it was evaluated for children aged 4‐17 years, it was concluded that itis valid and reliable in assessing muscle strength.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT06939933,,,Trial registry record,"Anemia, Sickle Cell",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02904533/full,

Household water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) interventions can reduce exposure to diarrhea‐causing pathogens, but meteorological factors may impact their effectiveness. Information about effect heterogeneity under different weather conditions is critical to refining these targeted interventions. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether temperature and precipitation modified the effect of low‐cost, point‐of‐use WASH interventions on child diarrhea. METHODS: We analyzed data from a trial in rural Bangladesh that compared child diarrhea prevalence between clusters (N=720) that were randomized to different WASH interventions between 2012 and 2016 (NCT01590095). We matched temperature and precipitation measurements to diarrhea outcomes (N=12,440 measurements, 6,921 children) by geographic coordinates and date. We estimated prevalence ratios (PRs) using generative additive models and targeted maximum likelihood estimation to assess the effectiveness of each WASH intervention under different weather conditions. RESULTS: Generally, WASH interventions most effectively prevented diarrhea during monsoon season, particularly following weeks with heavy rain or high temperatures. The PR for diarrhea in the WASH interventions group compared with the control group was 0.49 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.68) after 1 d of heavy rainfall, with a less‐protective effect [PR=0.87 (95% CI: 0.60, 1.25)] when there were no days with heavy rainfall. Similarly, the PR for diarrhea in the WASH intervention group compared with the control group was 0.60 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.75) following above‐median temperatures vs. 0.91 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.35) following below‐median temperatures. The influence of precipitation and temperature varied by intervention type; for precipitation, the largest differences in effectiveness were for the sanitation and combined WASH interventions. DISCUSSION: WASH intervention effectiveness was strongly influenced by precipitation and temperature, and nearly all protective effects were observed during the rainy season. Future implementation of these interventions should consider local environmental conditions to maximize effectiveness, including targeted efforts to maintain latrines and promote community adoption ahead of monsoon seasons. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13807.",132,4,47006,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 38602833,,,,,Journal article,"*Sanitation; *Water; Bangladesh [epidemiology]; Child; Diarrhea [epidemiology, prevention & control]; Hand Disinfection; Humans; South Asian People; Temperature",10.1289/EHP13807,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02688798/full,

The aim of the study was to assess the effects of a specific synbiotic combination at doses closer to the bacterial cells present in human milk, on intestinal bifidobacteria proportions (relative abundance), reduction of potential pathogens and gut physiological conditions. A clinical study was conducted in 290 healthy infants aged from 6 to 19 weeks. Infants received either a control infant formula or one of the two investigational infant formulas (control formula with 0.8 g/100 ml scGOS/lcFOS and Bifidobacterium breve M‐16V at either 1 × 104 cfu/ml or 1 × 106 cfu/ml). Exclusively breastfed infants were included as a reference. Analyses were performed on intention‐to‐treat groups and all‐subjects‐treated groups. After 6 weeks of intervention, the synbiotics at two different doses significantly increased the bifidobacteria proportions in healthy infants. The synbiotic supplementation also decreased the prevalence (infants with detectable levels) and the abundance of C. difficile. Closer to the levels in the breastfed reference group, fecal pH was significantly lower while L‐lactate concentrations and acetate proportions were significantly higher in the synbiotic groups. All formulas were well tolerated and all groups showed a comparable safety profile based on the number and severity of adverse events and growth. In healthy infants, supplementation of infant‐type bifidobacterial strain B. breve M‐16V, at a dose close to bacterial numbers found in human milk, with scGOS/lcFOS (9:1) created a gut environment closer to the breastfed reference group.

Leading to significant negative effect on patients' quality of life and huge financial burden to health system, the management of IBS is a great challenge. Probiotics are considered as an effective therapy; however, in a lack of high‐quality evidence of efficacy, no strain‐ and dose‐specific probiotics were recommended in clinical guidelines. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the Bifidobacterium quadruple viable tablet in the treatment of IBS‐D. Methods/design: A multicenter randomized controlled trial will be performed in fourteen hospitals. A total of three hundred patients who fulfill the eligibility criteria will be stratified divided into an experimental group and a control group randomly in a ratio of 1:1. The experimental group is treated with the Bifidobacterium quadruple viable tablet while the control group is treated with placebo. All the patients will receive a 4‐week treatment and a 2‐week follow‐up. The primary outcome is the effectiveness in improving abdominal pain and stool consistency; the secondary outcome includes evaluation of overall symptom relief, frequency of defecation, bloating, urgency of defecation, remedial medication, score of IBS‐QOL, and changes of microbiota and metabonomics.

Multiple factors influence the development of obesity. Some research suggested that gut microbiota (GM) plays an important role in nutrient absorption and energy regulation of individuals, thus affecting their nutritional status. Report of Indonesia Basic Health Research showed that the prevalence of obesity in every province tended to increase. Although the root cause of obesity is excessive calorie intake compared with expenditure, the differences in gut microbial ecology between healthy and obese humans may affect energy homeostasis. GM affect body weight, especially obesity. Probiotics that are consumed while alive and able to colonize in the intestine are expected to increase the population of good bacteria, especially Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, and suppress pathogens such as Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus. The strain of L. plantarum Dad‐13 has been demonstrated to survive and colonize in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy Indonesian adults who consume fermented milk containing L. plantarum Dad‐13. The consumption of probiotic L. plantarum Dad‐13 powder decreased E. coli and non‐E. coli coliform bacteria in school‐aged children in Indonesia. L. plantarum is a dominant bacterium in the average Indonesian’s GM. For this reason, this bacterium is probably a more suitable probiotic for Indonesians. AIM To determine the effect of the consumption of indigenous probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum Dad‐13 powder in overweight adults in Yogyakarta (Indonesia). METHODS Sixty overweight volunteers with a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 25 consume indigenous probiotic powder L. plantarum Dad‐13 (2 × 109 CFU/gram/sachet) for 90 d. The study was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study. The volunteers filled in a diary on a daily basis, which consisted of questions on study product intake (only during ingestion period), other food intake, number of bowel movements, fecal quality (consistency and color), any medications received, and any symptom of discomfort, such as diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, gassing, sensation of illness, etc. Fecal samples and the subjects’ diaries were collected on the morning of day 10 + 1, which was marked as the end of the baseline period and the start of the ingestion period. During the ingestion period (from day 11 to day 101), several parameters to measure and analyze the results included body weight and height (once a month), the lipid profile, GM analysis using MiSeq, short‐chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis using gas chromatography, and the measurement of fecal pH using a pH meter. RESULTS The consumption of indigenous probiotic powder L. plantarum Dad‐13 caused the average body weight and BMI of the probiotic group to decrease from 84.54 ± 17.64 kg to 83.14 ± 14.71 kg and 33.10 ± 6.15 kg/m2 to 32.57 ± 5.01 kg/m2, respectively. No significant reduction of body weight and BMI in the placebo group was observed. An analysis of the microbiota showed that the number of Bacteroidetes, specifically Prevotella, increased significantly, while that of Firmicutes significantly decreased. No significant change in lipid profile in both groups was found. Also, no significant change in SCFAs (e.g., butyrate, propionate, acetic acid) and pH level was found after the consumption of the probiotic. CONCLUSION No significant differences in pH before and after ingestion were observed in both the probiotic and placebo groups as well as in the lipid profile of both cholesterol and triglyceride, high‐density lipoprotein (HDL), low‐density lipoprotein (LDL), and the LDL/HDL ratio. In addition, no significant changes in the concentration of SCFAs (e.g., acetic acid, propionate, and butyrate) were found after consumption. Interestingly, a significant decrease in body weight and BMI (P < 0.05) was determined in the treatment group. An analysis of GM shows that L. plantarum Dad‐13 caused the Firmicutes population to decrease and the Bacteroidetes population (especially Prevotella) to increase.",27,1,107‐128,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 33505154,EMBASE 2010791576,,,,Journal article,*Lactobacillus plantarum; *body mass; *body weight loss; *intestine flora; *lipid fingerprinting; *obese patient; *powder; Adult; Article; Caloric intake; Child; Clinical trial; Coliform bacterium; Constipation; Controlled study; Defecation; Diarrhea; Diet; Double blind procedure; Double‐Blind Method; Drug therapy; Ecology; Energy balance; Enterobacteriaceae; Escherichia coli; Feces; Female; Fermented dairy product; Food intake; Gas chromatography; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Genetic analyzer; Human; Humans; Indonesia; Indonesia [epidemiology]; Indonesian; Lactobacillus plantarum; Lifestyle; Major clinical study; Male; Medical research; Nonhuman; Nutrient; Nutritional status; PH; Physical activity; Powders; Prevalence; Prevotella; Probiotics [therapeutic use]; Randomized controlled trial; Sensation; Staphylococcus; Vomiting,10.3748/wjg.v27.i1.107,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02247556/full,Complementary Medicine

This study is aimed at evaluating the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal parasitosis, malnutrition, and anemia amongst elementary and junior school students in Ghindae area, Eritrea. Method. A cross‐sectional study was conducted in 6 schools around Ghindae from February to April 2018. 460 children were selected randomly for analysis and consent was taken from guardians. The pertinent sociodemographic data was collected using a pretested questionnaire, and anthropometric measurements were carried out to determine the proportion of students with malnutrition, stunting, and thinness. Fecal samples were examined by formal‐ether concentration technique, and blood specimen was collected and analyzed for the assessment of hemoglobin using Hemocue analyzers. The association between predictors and outcome variables were measured with a stepwise logistic regression model. Result. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was 45.3%. Protozoan infections (38.2%) were more prevalent than soil‐transmitted helminthic infections (10.4%). The presence of different intestinal parasitic infections had statistically significant association with the residence area, hand washing habits, source of drinking water, and type of latrine used. The prevalence of malnutrition was 36.9% with 18.5% stunting and 21.2% thinness. Students of rural areas had 2.03 times more odds of having malnutrition. The current prevalence of anemia was 12.4%, out of which 7.6% had mild anemia while 4.4% of them had moderate anemia and 0.4% were severely anemic. Conclusion. The prevalence of parasitic infection among school‐age children in Ghindae area was high. Unsafe drinking water sources from streams and springs were among the core problems for increased prevalence along with decreased awareness on personal hygienic and sanitation practices. Undernutrition was widely prevalent among students in Ghindae area. Height for age and BMI for age scores of all participants were found to be below the WHO growth standards. Malnutrition was in higher prevalence in rural areas outside Ghindae, which is attributed to two times higher odds than their counterparts. The magnitude of anemia found in this study is considered a mild public health problem.",2020,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 2008583334,,,,Journal article,*anemia /diagnosis /etiology; *childhood disease /diagnosis /etiology; *intestine infection /diagnosis /etiology; *malnutrition /diagnosis /etiology; *parasitosis /diagnosis /etiology; *prevalence; *risk factor; Adolescent; Anthropometry; Article; Body height; Body mass; Child; Content validity; Controlled study; Cross‐sectional study; Data analysis software; Demography; Disease severity; Entamoeba dispar; Entamoeba histolytica; Eritrea; Face validity; Female; Giardia intestinalis; Hand washing; Helminthiasis /etiology; Hemoglobin blood level; High risk population; Human; Hymenolepis nana; Major clinical study; Male; Multicenter study; Outcome variable; Pathogenesis; Personal hygiene; Protozoal infection /etiology; Questionnaire; Randomized controlled trial; Resource allocation; School child; Social status; Stunting; Underweight,10.1155/2020/4230260,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02205164/full,

To reduce the prevalence of these diseases, effective interventions for adequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) should be implemented. This paper describes the design of a cluster‐randomized controlled trial that will compare the efficacy of four school‐based WaSH interventions for improving children’s health literacy, handwashing, and nutrition. Interventions consisted of (1) WaSH policy reinforcement; (2) low‐, medium‐, or high‐volume health education; (3) hygiene supplies; and (4) WaSH facilities (e.g., toilets, urinals, handwashing basins) improvements. We randomly allocated school clusters from the intervention arm to one of four groups to compare with schools from the control arm. Primary outcomes were: children’s health literacy, physical growth, nutrition status, and handwashing prevalence. Secondary outcomes were: children’s self‐reported health status and history of extreme hunger, satisfaction with WaSH facilities, and school restrooms’ WaSH adequacy. We will measure differences in pre‐and post‐intervention outcomes and compare these differences between control and intervention arms. This research protocol can be a blueprint for future school‐based WaSH intervention studies to be conducted in LMICs.

The objective of the study was to determine the risk factors of HAV infection in the Gampha District in Sri Lanka. METHODS: This was an unmatched case control study conducted between January 2015 and November 2016 comprising of 504 participants with a case control ratio of 1:1. The study population included individuals of age 1 year and above who were permanent residents of the district. Cases included participants admitted to four secondary care state hospitals with an acute HAV diagnosed by detecting serum anti‐HAV IgM antibodies. Controls were randomly selected individuals from the community with serum negative for Anti‐HAV IgM and IgG. An interviewer administered questionnaire was used for the data collection and multiple logistic regression was applied to determine the independent risk factors. The results are expressed as adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Risk factors for HAV infection were poor knowledge regarding hepatitis (AOR;3.98, 95% CI = 1.97‐8.05), unhygienic sanitary practices (OR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.42‐5.23), unhygienic practices related to drinking water (OR = 2.67; 95% CI = 1.37‐5.21), residing in urban areas (OR = 5.94; 95% CI = 2.98‐11.86) and lower family income (OR = 2.83; 95% CI = 1.30‐6.13). CONCLUSIONS: The independent modifiable risk factors for HAV infection were poor knowledge regarding hepatitis, unhygienic sanitary practices, and unhygienic practices related to drinking water. Community awareness must be raised on hygienic practices and safe water drinking practices. Inequities of social determinates of health must be addressed.",20,1,357,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 32188427,EMBASE 631282077,,,,Journal article,"*Sri Lanka; *acute hepatitis A; *case control study; *hygiene; *risk factor; *sanitation; Adolescent; Adult; Article; Awareness; Case‐Control Studies; Child; Controlled study; Drinking behavior; Family income; Female; Fluid intake; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hepatitis A [*epidemiology]; Hepatitis A virus; Human; Human tissue; Humans; Major clinical study; Male; Nonhuman; Questionnaire; Randomized controlled trial; Resident; Risk Factors; Secondary health care; Socioeconomic Factors; Sri Lanka [epidemiology]; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban area; Young Adult",10.1186/s12889-020-08490-2,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02096407/full,
CN-02089225,"NCT04315350,",The Effect of Curcumin on the Development of Prednisolone-induced Hepatic Insulin Resistance,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04315350,2020,"AIMS OF STUDY The aim of this study is to investigate whether ingestion of curcumin will prevent hepatic insulin resistance (assessed by homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR)) induced by short‐term oral glucocorticoid (prednisolone) administration in overweight and obese participants. BACKGROUND The increasing incidence and prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities calls for research in preventing these diseases. The progression to insulin resistance and increased blood sugar levels (i.e. prediabetes) and ultimately type 2 diabetes (T2D) in obesity is believed to be caused by various factors of which low‐grade inflammation in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle tissue seems to inflict insulin resistance initiating metabolic deterioration towards the type 2 diabetic phenotype. Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound that can be extracted from the turmeric root, have been shown to exert anti‐inflammatory properties in both in vitro and animal studies. Furthermore, animal studies indicate that curcumin is a modulator of gut microbiota composition in a metabolic beneficial direction. Studies have shown positive results in terms of lowering hepatic insulin resistance with curcumin in rodents and humans (measured by HOMA‐IR), and another clinical trial has shown that curcumin can prevent worsening of HOMA‐IR and development of T2D in a prediabetic population. Glucocorticoids are a group of frequently used compounds, prescribed for a wide range of diseases and have severe metabolic side effects as insulin resistance, T2D and non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease. Interestingly, curcumin, a phenolic compound extracted from the turmeric root, and curcumin analogues have been shown to ameliorate glucocorticoid‐induced 'dysmetabolism' in rodent studies, but no human data exist. Also, results from both in vitro and in vivo studies with curcumin have shown promising effects in preventing NAFLD development, but solid human data are missing. Because of the temporary effects on glucose metabolism, short‐term treatment with glucocorticoids can be used as an investigative model of these metabolic changes. Previous studies from the research unit performing the current study, used this setup to investigate changes in glucose homeostasis, incretin hormones and insulin resistance. Two different mouse studies indicate that curcumin could be beneficial in terms of preventing the metabolic changes associated with systemic glucocorticoid treatment, but no human studies have investigated if curcumin can prevent glucocorticoid‐induced increase in HOMA‐IR. The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of curcumin of the metabolic changes caused by short‐term systemic prednisolone in a double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled trial in overweight and obese individuals. STUDY DESIGN Participants 27 overweight and obese individuals without diabetes METHODS In this randomised, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled trial, eligible participants will undergo baseline assessments before being randomised to one of the following interventions: 1) Two tablets of curcumin (each tablet containing 100 mg curcumin) twice daily in 11 days and 50 mg of prednisolone once daily in 10 days (capsule); 2) two tablets of placebo‐curcumin twice daily in 11 days and 50 mg of prednisolone once daily in 10 days (capsule); 3) two tablets of placebo‐curcumin twice daily in 11 days and one capsule of placebo‐prednisolone once daily in 10 days. In the end of the 11‐day intervention period, end‐of‐intervention assessments (similar to baseline assessments) will be performed. If necessary, a follow‐up visit will be made. Information meeting and screening Prior to any protocol‐related procedures, an information meeting will be arranged, and participants will be informed of the possibility of bringing a person of own choice to the visit. The information meeting is performed in undisturbed and confidential surroundings. The room is reserved for this purpose, and nobody will interfere during the meeting. It is not possible for other employees in the department to look into the room. During this meeting, a member of the research group will explain the purpose, procedures and possible risks of the study. The member of the research group will have proper qualifications in terms of medical knowledge, insights in the specific project and communications skills. It is firstly pointed out that the project is a biomedical trial. After this, an oral information about the project is given based on the written information. Questions will be answered as thoroughly as possible. The participant will be informed that it is possible to have a minimum of 48 hours to evaluate participation from oral information is given. If he does not want time to evaluate the participation, the informed consent can be obtained. If he wants time to evaluate participation, a new meeting will be arranged with a minimum of 48 hours from the information meeting. When the informed consent has been obtained, screening can be done, either the same day or another day, but with a maximum of four weeks after obtaining the informed consent. The participant will be informed that it is possible to withdraw the written consent at any time prior to or during the study. In the case that significant information about the participants health is found during the trial, the participant will be able to decline having this information. Information about this choice is confirmed in the informed consent form. If the participant wants to know about the results of the trial and the possible consequences for the participant, he will have the rights to get this information after the end of the study At screening, height and body weight will be measured, medication and medical history will be recorded, blood will be sampled for assessment of plasma/serum concentrations of thyroid‐stimulating hormone, creatinine, creatine kinase, electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, bilirubin, gamma‐glutamyltransferase, viral hepatitis markers, platelet count, ferritin and haemoglobin, and albumin‐creatinine ratio in the urine will be measured. A physical examination will be made including evaluation of blood pressure and pulse rate. Alcohol habits will be evaluated based on The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) questionnaire and quantification of the weekly amount of alcohol. An MR safety checklist will be completed, and an MR information sheet will be given. If all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are met, dates for baseline assessments and randomisation visit will be planned within 6 weeks from the screening visit. The participant will be instructed not to consume curcumin‐containing food on a daily basis from screening until end of trial. Baseline assessments and randomisation visit If the participant is included during COVID19 pandemic, a phone call is done the day before the visit to ask about recent symptoms of infection, contacts to people with COVID19 symptoms or people with positive test for COVID19. Included individuals will undergo an MRS of the liver (scheduled as close as possible to the randomisation visit). Before intervention start, both randomisation visit and MRS will be performed. For MRS, participants are placed in a horizontal position. During the MRS, a spectroscopy of the liver will be assessed, and an estimation of visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue will be done. During the last week before randomisation, the subject will collect a stool sample for the determination of gut bacteria count and subtype. Stool samples will be collected by the participant at home. Prior to defaecation a disposable collector will be placed in the toilet from where stool will be transferred to a tube that immediately is transferred to a transport container and placed at ‐20°C in the patient's freezer. Prior to transport to Gentofte Hospital, the transport container is transferred to the cooler bag and at arrival at Gentofte Hospital the transport container (with the sample tube) is immediately stored in at ‐80°C for later analysis. This entails DNA extraction, library preperation, MiSeq 16S rRNA sequencing and microbiota analysis (relative abundance, alpha/beta diversity, link to phenotype of interest). On the randomisation visit, the participant will meet in the laboratory around 8 a.m. after 10 hours of fast (including any medication) and refrainment from tobacco or nicotine supplements use. The participant is allowed to drink water until 8 hours before meeting in department. Furthermore, the participant will be requested to avoid heavy alcohol intake (more than 5 units of alcohol per day) and strenuous exercise two days prior to the visit and instructed to use non‐strenuous methods of transportation to the research facility. The following procedures will be conducted: If the test day is during COVID19 pandemic, the participant is tested for Sars‐Cov2 with a swab procedure in the oropharynx, for immidiate PCR analysis. 1. A fasting urine sample will be collected, and the participant is asked to empty the urinary bladder completely 2. Fasting blood samples will be collected (bone markers, serum markers of muscle breakdown, biomarkers of NASH and fibrosis, fibroblast growths factors, triglycerides, cholesterols, liver parameters, HbA1c, inflammatory markers, adipokines, creatinine, haemoglobin) amounting 25 ml. 3. FibroScan: The participant will be lying in a supine position for approximately 10 minutes during which a probe using shear‐waves and ultrasound is applied in the right side of the body below the ribs. 4. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, body weight and hip and waist circumference. 5. A questionnaire is handed out regarding calorie intake and physical activity the day prior to randomisation 6. IOP is measured with icare ic100 tonometer. 7. One cannula will be inserted in the cubital vein for collection of blood samples. The forearm from which blood samples are drawn will be wrapped in a heating blanket (42°C) throughout the experiment (for arterialisation of venous blood). 8. Blood samples (for analysis of total amino acids, gut hormones, glucose, glucagon, insulin, C‐peptide, urea, FFA) will be measured throughout the OGTT (see Table 1). 9. At time 0 min, the participant will ingest 75 g of water‐free glucose dissolved in 300 ml water over a period of 5 minutes. 10. At time 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240 and after the ad libitum meal, hunger, satiety, fullness and prospective food consumption will be measured by VASs 11. During the last hour (time 180 min ‐ 240 min), REE will be measured in a supine position by indirect calorimetry to determine oxygen consumption (V02) and carbon dioxide production (VC02). A flow‐through canopy gas analyser will be used, as previously described. 12. At time 240 min, the subject will be asked to provide a new urine sample for measurement of urea concentration. The participant will be asked to empty the urinary bladder completely. Urine volume will be measured. 13. At time 250 min, the participant will ingest a standardised ad libitum meal consisting of minced meat, pasta, corn, carrots, peppers, cream, salt and pepper (50 energy (E)% carbohydrate, 37 E% fat, 13 E% protein). The participant will be instructed to eat as much as possible until feeling comfortable saturate. The meal should be consumed within a maximum of 30 minutes and by the end of the meal, time spent eating, weight of the meal and the total amount of energy consumed will be noted. 14. A continuous glucose monitor will be applied on the upper arm of the participant. The sensor is blinded which means that the participant cannot see his blood glucose excursions during the 14 days period of measurements. At the end of the randomisation visit, the participant will be randomly assigned to one of three interventions (1:1:1): 1. Two tablets of curcumin (corresponding to 200 mg) twice daily from day 1 to day 11 and prednisolone capsule 50 mg (oral) once daily from day 2 to day 11 2. Two tablets of placebo‐curcumin twice daily from day 1 to day 11 and prednisolone capsule 50 mg once daily from day 2 to day 11, or 3. Two tablets of placebo‐curcumin twice daily from day 1 to day 11 and placebo‐prednisolone capsule once daily from day 2 to day 11 The tablets with curcumin and placebo‐curcumin will appear identical, and the capsules with prednisolone or placebo‐prednisolone will appear identical. The supplier of curcumin will also produce placebo‐curcumin tablets (Indena Aps, Milan, Italy). The pharmacy of Region H will be responsible of production and delivery of prednisolone and placebo‐prednisolon. Unblinded site‐staff will be responsible for labelling and blinding of the curcumin and placebo‐curcumin tablets and prednisolone and placebo‐prednisolone capsules before the beginning of the intervention period. A person not otherwise involved in the study will generate a randomisation code using a random list generator. A randomisation list with randomisation numbers and corresponding treatment will be made by the unblinded site‐staff. A list with randomisation number and corresponding packages with numbers will be made by unblinded site‐staff, so that blinded site staff is only allocating a randomisation number at the day of randomisation. The list with the information about randomisation number and corresponding treatment will be kept at Center for Clinical Metabolic Research at Gentofte Hospital. If a participant develops adverse events (AEs) that demand knowledge of the content of the intervention, the list will show if the patient is having any active ingredients. If a participant is excluded of the trial before end‐of‐intervention visit, a new subject will be included in the same treatment‐arm by taking over the randomisation number. The interventional period If the participant was tested for Sars‐Cov2‐infection at randomization visit, this test has to be negative before start of intervention. If the participant is included during COVID19 pandemic, a telephone call is made the day before intervention start, to ensure the following guidelines are followed: If the participant has experiences symptoms of COVID19 during the last seven days prior to intervention start or had close contact with COVID19‐patients, intervention will not be started. Intervention will start soon after baseline MRS and randomisation visit. During the intervention period, each participant will fill out a dairy to keep track of any new concomitant medication, compliance and possible AEs. The participant will be asked to keep the alcohol and smoking habits they might have had before screening and, thus, not to consume more than 21 units of alcohol per week. Furthermore, they will be asked to consume no more than 5 units in one night. The participant will be requested to maintain the level of physical activity from before intervention during the interventional period. The participant will be informed that if he feels more hungry than usual, he is allowed to eat extra. At day 5, 6 or 7 in the intervention period, the participant will receive a telephone call from the investigator or other delegated site staff, checking on AEs, concomitant medication and compliance, and to answer any questions from the participant. Furthermore, participants are instructed to contact investigator or other delegated site staff in case of any questions or intolerable side effects. The tablets and capsules are preferably ingested with a meal and a small glass of water. Should the participant forget to take a dose of curcumin/placebo curcumin, it can be ingested until 6 hours before the next planned dose. If a dosage is missed, and the next one is planned within 6 hours, the dosage should be passed, and the incident must be noted in the diary. Should the participant forget to take a dose of prednisolone/placebo‐prednisolone, it can be ingested until 12 hours prior to the next dose. If a dosage is missed, and the next one is planned within the next 12 hours, the dosage should med passed, and the incident must be noted in the diary. If the participant is included during COVID19 pandemic: The participant is instructed to adhere to social distancing and to be aware of COVID19‐symptoms, and call site staff in any case of symptoms during intervention period or if he has had close contact to a person who had a positive Sars‐Cov2‐test, and to immediately stop intake of intervention and self‐isolate in this case. End‐of‐intervention assessments and visit The end‐of‐intervention visit will be planned on day 12 after start of intervention. If the participant is included during COVID19 pandemic, a telephone call is done the day before the visit to ask about recent symptoms of COVID19, recent contacts to people with COVID19 symptoms or people with positive test for COVID19. Stool sample collection and MRS will be performed in the period around end‐of‐intervention visit, and will be performed as described above under ""baseline assessments and randomisation visit"". Procedures during the end‐of‐intervention visit are similar to the ones described above under ""Baseline assessments and randomisation visit"". Also, during this day, to check for any effect of curcumin intervention, physical examination will be performed by a physician from the research team and additional blood samples (identical with the samples at the screening visit, except viral hepatitis markers) will be collected (which adds another 5 ml blood samples compared to randomisation visit) and albumin‐creatinine ratio in the urine will be measured. The continuous glucose monitor sensor is removed from the upper arm of the participant, and the data from the sensor is transferred to a suitable software program. Again, the questionnaire is handed out regarding calorie intake and physical activity the day prior to the End‐of‐intervention day. Compliance will be evaluated (if compliance is insufficient (missed more than ¼ of planned doses), the participant will not go through end‐of‐intervention assessments). If the participant is included during COVID19 pandemic, he is instructed to continue social distancing for three days after end‐of‐intervention visit. Follow‐up phone call and visit Between two and four days after last day on treatment, the participant will receive a telephone call, where the participant is asked about withdrawal symptoms and symptoms of COVID19. Due to COVID19, an extra telephone call is made at day 5‐8 after end‐of‐intervention visit. If the participant feels any kind of withdrawal symptoms (tiredness, weakness, abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea or vomiting), or has had any symptoms of an ongoing infection after End‐of‐intervention, a plan of action is made. Judged from the physical examination, blood tests, results from continuous glucose monitoring, MRS and FibroScan at End‐of‐intervention visit, a follow‐up visit will be arranged, if it ‐ judged by the investigator ‐ is necessary. At this follow‐up visit (3‐4 weeks after End‐of‐intervention) the investigator can do any or all of the following tests; physical examination, FibroScan, measurement of IOC, standard OGTT and blood tests, whichever is judged to be necessary to look into any late effects of the intervention, and if necessary, another follow‐up visit after another 1‐3 months. If the participant had steatosis on both MRS's, the participant will be offered a referral to the Department of Gastroenterology for further evaluation and treatment. BIOBANK A research biobank will be established at at Center for Clinical Metabolic Research at Gentofte Hospital, DK‐2900 Hellerup, Denmark, during the experiments to store the blood tests until analyses. All participants are assigned with a trial number and will on data sheets and tubes only appear with the trial number. The full name, social security number and trial number will be stored separately. After the project is completed the biobank will be terminated. Excess plasma will be stored in another biobank for up to 10 years after the completion of the study, in case of need of re‐analyses or need for further analyses. In the latter case, a new approval by the Regional Health Research Ethics Committee is required. The biobanks will be registered with Datatilsynet. CALCULATIONS AND STATISTICS Data will be processed and presented with the use of standard descriptive statistics. Areas under the curves (AUCs) are calculated by use of the trapezoid rule. Comparison of normally distributed data is carried out by means of repeated measurements analysis of variance using linear mixed modeling with ""individual"" as random factor. Freidmans test will be used for analysis of non‐normally distributed data. P values ≤0.05 are accepted as statistically significant (significance level, α = 5%). Power of the study (1‐β) is set to 80%, where β (20%) is the risk of accepting a hypothesis that is false. Power calculation: Hansen et al. studied a prednisolone‐treated group of healthy individuals, and found an increase in HOMA‐IR of 1.6 (1.3±0.1 vs. 2.9±0.3). The difference is 1.6±SD, but the value of this SD we unfortunately do not have. Best guess is that it is (maximum) 0.5. It is hypothesized that the intervention group receiving two different kinds of placebo is comparable to the baseline values in KB Hansens study, both before and after intervention, as placebo expectedly will not change HOMA‐IR. And it is hypothesized that the prednisolone treated group is comparable with KB Hansens cohort after treatment with prednisolone. The wish is to achieve a reduction in the increase in HOMA‐IR of 50% when ingesting curcumin, which gives a minimal relevant difference of 0.8. P values ≤ 0.05 are accepted as statistically significant (α = 5%) and the power is set to 80%. This results in a sample size of 7 in each of the three treatment groups. . Based on this, we will include 9 in each of the three treatment groups, as we might have slightly more variance in HOMA‐IR in our population compared to KH Hansen's participants. In case of drop‐outs, we will include new participants until we have 12 completers in each group. The continuous glucose monitoring will provide data for up to 14 days with glucose measures with frequent intervals 24 hours per day. The CGM will be recording for at least 24 hours before start of intervention with prednisolon. CGM recordings are regarded successful if at least 80% of the sensor data are available for analysis. Before analysis, all data will be reviewed for pressure induced sensor attenuations. From these data, the following calculations will be made: 1) The risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia will be calculated as the low blood glucose index (LBGI) and the high blood glucose index (HBGI) using the EasyGV workbook (www.phc.ox.ac.uk/research/technology‐outputs/easygv) 2) coefficient of variability (SD/mean interstitial glucose level), 3) SD, 4) percentage of time in normoglycemic range (3,9‐7,8 mmol/l), 5) percentage of time in three hyperglycemic ranges (7.9‐10 mmol/l, 10.1‐13.9 mmol/l, >13.9mmol/l) and 6) percentage of time in hypoglycemia (<3.9 mmol/l). SIDE EFFECTS, RISKS AND DISADVANTAGES FOR PARTICIPANTS Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound extracted from the turmeric root with a very low bioavailability. High doses of Meriva® have been well tolerated in human trials. However, most studies have been performed with non‐formulated traditional curcumin with lower bioavailability. Nevertheless, high doses of non‐formulated curcumin have not been associated with severe side effects, and are generally very well tolerated in clinical trials. Panahi et al did a study with NAFLD patients, with 50 patients receiving Meriva® 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks (corresponding to 200 mg of curcumin). There were no reports of side effects, but 7 withdraw because of the perception of lack of effects. Antiga et. al. did a study with Meriva® 2000 mg daily for 12 weeks, with only one participant having one adverse event (diarrhoea), but presumably not caused by Meriva® because of other signs of viral genesis67. Mazzolani did a study with 12 patients receiving 1200 mg Meriva® per day for 1 year with no reports of AEs. Di Pierro et al. did a study on overweight participants, with a high dose of phosphatidylserine (a product very similar to Meriva®) with reports of no side effects. Prednisolone side effects are very well described, and most commonly are weight gain, skin abnormalities, increased serum glucose levels, insulin resistance, oedema, electrolyte derangement, myopathy, osteoporosis, infections, reduced symptoms of infections, haematological abnormalities, psychiatric diseases, mood changes, sleep disorders, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and heart failure. But if the participants will experience side effects, they are unlikely to get severe, when treating only with 50 mg daily for 10 days, as they are dose and time‐dependent, and with the relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria applied. Furthermore, they are all regarded as fully reversible after end of intervention. A side effect from treatment with oral corticosteroids (e.g. Prednisolone) is elevated IOP which in rare cases can cause the sight‐threatening condition, glaucoma. In most cases elevated IOP is asymptomatic, which is why, it is important to measure in the patient. IOP can simply and easily be measured with a icare ic100 tonometer. The device is based on a rebound measuring principle that requires no drops, air or specialized skills for its use, and therefore not associated with any risk or complications. IOP is measured 3 times in each eye and the mean is calculated. If this is elevated the patient will be seen by an ophthalmologist. During and right after prednisolone treatment, the participants are more prone to infections and are likely to have fewer symptoms of infections. Participants will be asked about their wellbeing and symptoms of infection several times during the trial. If the participant is included during the COVID19 pandemic, several extra restrictions and assessments are applied in the study, due to the possible increased risk of a severe course of COVID19 in case of prednisolone treatment. This is applied only to take extraordinary precautions. Information on these restrictions and assessments is found in the relevant parts of this protocol. Participants are thoroughly instructed in the relevant changes in the participant information documents before screening. Withdrawal symptoms (after prednisolone treatment) are most commonly tiredness, weakness, abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea or vomiting. Due to the short treatment period and relatively low dose, it is very unlikely these symptoms will occur, but participants will be asked about these symptoms at the telephone call two to four days after last day on treatment. MRS is safe and not coupled with discomfort or pain. The scanner will be making loud noise while scanning, but the participant will wear proper ear protection. Some participants may experience claustrophobia during the scan. If the participant has steatosis on both MRS, he will be offered a referral to the Department of Gastroenterology. Penetrations of skin (blood puncture and intravenous catheter insertion and insertion of sensor for continuous glucose monitoring) are associated with mild discomfort and risk of hematomas. A theoretical complication to skin penetration is superficial phlebitis. The condition is not dangerous and will be treated with antibiotics should any sign of infection be present. The risk of superficial phlebitis is small and minimized by following clinical standards for the insertion of intravascular catheters including double wiping of the involved skin with disinfectant alcohol and other sterile procedures. The total blood loss will amount to approximately 365 ml distributed over a minimum of 2 weeks, which is not in any way harmful for the participant. Only participants with haemoglobin >7.5 mmol/l can participate, and all participants are offered iron treatment after the trial. PARTICIPANTS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL INTEGRITY AND PRIVACY Information regarding participants of the project will be protected in accordance with the applicable laws of Denmark including the law concerning the processing of personal data. We will seek approval of the protocol by the Danish ""Datatilsynet"" via the The Capital Region of Denmark. The trial will follow the rules in European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. The protocol complies with the Helsinki Declaration (Seventh revision 2013).

Effective targeted water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions are urgently needed to reduce cholera globally. Individuals living within 50 meters of a cholera patient are at higher risk of developing cholera than the general population during the month after the index patient seeks care at a health facility. To build an evidence base on effective WASH interventions to reduce diarrheal diseases for this population, we developed the CHoBI7 cholera rapid response program. Once a cholera patient (confirmed by bacterial culture) is identified at a health facility, a health promoter delivers a targeted WASH intervention to the cholera hotspot (households within 50 meters of a cholera patient) through both in‐person visits, and weekly WASH mobile messages for the 3‐month program period. A randomized controlled trial of the CHoBI7 cholera rapid response program was conducted of 261 participants in 15 cholera hotspots in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh. This program was compared to the standard message in Bangladesh on the use of oral rehydration solution for dehydration. Five‐hour structured observation of handwashing with soap practices, and diarrhea surveillance was conducted monthly for the 3‐month program period. Delivery of the CHoBI7 cholera rapid response program significantly increased handwashing with soap throughout the 3‐month program period (Odds Ratio: 3.96 95% CI: 2.35, 6.66, p=0.035) (54% in the CHoBI7 arm vs. 23% in the standard arm). Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in diarrheal prevalence for all participants (adults and children) (Prevalence Ratio (PR) 0.35: ,95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.128 ‐ 0.99, p = 0.049), and for children under 5 years of age (PR: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.06 ‐ 0.74, p = 0.015) during the 3‐month program. These findings demonstrate that the CHoBI7 cholera rapid response program is effective in lowering diarrhea prevalence and increasing handwashing with soap for a population at high risk of cholera.",108,4,186,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 647429044,,,,Journal article; Conference proceeding,*Bangladesh; *cholera; *diarrhea; Adult; Bacterium culture; Child; Conference abstract; Controlled study; Dehydration; Drug therapy; Female; Hand washing; Health care facility; Household; Human; Major clinical study; Male; Oral drug administration; Preschool child; Prevalence; Promoter region; Randomized controlled trial; Sanitation,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02865921/full,

An ongoingepidemic in Yemen has caused 1.7 million cases of cholera, with 58% of cholera‐relateddeaths occurring in children. The World Health Organization (WHO) has targeted theelimination of cholera transmission by the year 2030, but the increasing burden ofcholera suggests that more effective approaches are needed to prevent the disease. Accessto safe water and sanitation and the use of oral cholera vaccines (OCV) are central tothe WHO‐proposed approach, but children remain particularly vulnerable. Children are atthe highest risk of severe disease, and current cholera vaccines are ineffective in youngchildren. In addition, natural disasters and human conflict often delay vaccination andother large‐scale interventions.Effective antibiotics reduce the volume and duration of diarrhea in cholera by over 50%and bacterial shedding by 80%. They are recommended for the treatment of moderate tosevere cholera. Due to limited data, there are no standards for the use of antibioticprophylaxis for cholera, resulting in widely varied clinical practices and the frequentuse of antibiotics with unproven efficacy. For this reason, the WHO Global Task Force onCholera Control has prioritized research in this area, suggesting that further use ofprophylactic antibiotics for cholera should be stopped until prospective studies designedto measure the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis and its impact on antibioticresistance can be conducted. This study will address these two knowledge gaps. This studywill determine whether a single dose of azithromycin is effective in preventing V.cholerae infection in children, and evaluate the impact of its administration onantibiotic resistance in the gut. This study focuses on children because current OCVs areineffective in young children and because children are at the highest risk of infectionand mortality from cholera. While single‐dose azithromycin is a preferred treatment forcholera, it has never been studied as prophylaxis.

We used two protocols, doxycycline‐based quadruple regimen and concomitant levofloxacin regimen. The aim was to assess the effectiveness of doxycycline‐based quadruple regimen for treating Helicobacter Pylori infections compared with levofloxacin concomitant regimen as empirical first‐line therapy based on intention‐to‐treat (ITT) and per‐protocol analyses (PPA) in Syrian population. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: An open‐label, randomised, parallel, superiority clinical trial. METHODS: We randomly assigned 78 naïve patients who tested positive for Helicobacter Pylori gastric infection, with a 1:1 ratio to (D‐group) which received (bismuth subsalicylate 524 mg four times daily, doxycycline 100 mg, tinidazole 500 mg, and esomeprazole 20 mg, each twice per day for 2 weeks), or (L‐group) which received (levofloxacin 500 mg daily, tinidazole 500 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg, and esomeprazole 20 mg each twice per day for two weeks). We confirmed Helicobacter Pylori eradication by stool antigen test 8 weeks after completing the treatment. RESULTS: Thirty‐nine patients were allocated in each group. In the D‐group, 38 patients completed the follow‐up, 30 patients were cured. While in the L‐group, 39 completed the follow‐up, 32patients were cured. According to ITT, the eradication rates were 76.92%, and 82.05%, for the D‐group and L‐group respectively. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was 1.371 [0.454‐4.146]. According to PPA, the eradication rates were 78.9%, and 82.05% for the D‐group and L‐group respectively. The odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was 1.219 [0.394‐3.774]. We didn't report serious adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Levofloxacin concomitant therapy wasn't superior to doxycycline based quadruple therapy. Further researches are required to identify the optimal first‐line treatment for Helicobacter‐Pylori Infection in the Syrian population.

To assess the effectiveness of a novel house design, ""Star home"", and improved toilets in reducing the abundance of domestic flies, potential carriers of diarrhoeal pathogens, a randomized controlled trial was carried out in rural Tanzania. METHODS: Domestic fly populations were monitored in 28 randomly selected Star homes and 28 traditional thatched roofs and mud‐walled houses over 2 years from January 2022 to December 2023. Flies were sampled in kitchens and toilets using baited‐fly traps from 07.00 h to 17.30 h every 7 weeks. To assess the production of flies from toilets, traps were placed over drop holes to collect emerging flies. Duration of external door openings to the kitchens was recorded with data loggers. FINDINGS: Of the 1527 flies collected, 76% were Chrysomya putoria, 16% Musca domestica and 8% Sarcophaga spp. In kitchen collections, there were 46% fewer C. putoria flies [adjusted mean rate ratio (RR) = 0.54] and 69% fewer Sarcophaga spp. (RR = 0.31) in Star homes compared to traditional houses. There was no difference in the abundance of M. domestica in the two study groups. In toilets, there was 49% fewer C. putoria (RR = 0.51), but no difference was observed for other domestic fly species. No flies emerged from Star home toilets compared with a mean of 4.2 flies/trap/day in traditional toilets. During the day, the external doors od Star homes were open for an average of 13.0 min/h less than in traditional houses. CONCLUSIONS: Star homes reduced the abundance of domestic flies, apart from houseflies, in the kitchen and there were fewer C. putoria, a putative vector of diarrhoeal diseases, in Star home toilets compared to traditional houses.

However, long‐term crises received unparallel attention. Researchers have previously carried out a trial that investigated the impact of using chemical means to treat water reservoirs of Um‐Baddah Nevachah, a refugee camp located in the western outskirts of Khartoum, Sudan. A double‐blind community experimental trial was carried out by randomly adding either chlorine or a placebo to the major water tanks in the area. Data were collected using a mixed‐methods study design. The primary input was the quantitative data derived from total coliforms lab tests and records of the local primary healthcare center, while the embedded (nested) portion generated most of the qualitative data from direct face‐to‐face interviews. As a case analysis, this study aims to critically appraise the original trial. In the Background the authors discussed the context of the trial, approach used, and outcomes. Discussion section included three issues related to the trial: scientific importance, challenges and strategies. DISCUSSION: Importance: There are two factors that contribute to the importance of this study: First, the integrated and systematic approach followed to resolve associated challenges. The study swiftly moved from investigating potential water contamination, to test whether it is related to an endogenous focus that auto‐taints drinking water, and finally it explored the impact of tanks chlorination on public health. Second, the longstanding humanitarian context which remains largely underreported in literature. Challenges: funding limitations were among the first obstacles faced. During the fieldwork preparation phase, a lot of work was required to resolve logistical and security challenges. Keeping volunteers motivated was the biggest concern during the last phase of data collection. Strategies: The ""Matrix Solutions Strategy"" was developed and used to optimize scarce resources to simultaneously target multiple problems through a single intervention. CONCLUSION: Key lessons learned from the whole experience were: persistence is paramount for the success of studies in precarious situations; lateral thinking generates alternative solutions that are novel, feasibility and practical in resources‐limited settings; and finally respecting local culture and regulations is essential for building trust with both authorities and vulnerable societies.",21,1,2111,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 34789230,,,,,Journal article,Data Collection; Humans; Refugee Camps; Research Personnel; Sudan; Water,10.1186/s12889-021-12154-0,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02354647/full,

We aimed to study the effect of short‐term overfeeding on human gut microbiota in relation to baseline and overfeeding‐induced liver steatosis. We also asked whether the baseline microbiota composition is associated to the overfeeding‐induced increase in liver fat. Methods: In a randomized trial, 38 overweight and obese subjects were assigned to consume an excess of 1000 kcal/day of diets rich in either saturated fat, unsaturated fat, or simple sugars for 3 weeks. Fasting blood samples and 1H‐MR spectroscopy were used for extensive clinical phenotyping as previously reported (PMID: 29844096). Fecal samples were collected for the analysis of the gut microbiota using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, imputed metagenomics and qPCR. Microbiota results were correlated with dietary intakes and clinical measurements before and during overfeeding. Results: The overall community structure of the microbiota remained highly stable and personalized during overfeeding based on between‐sample Bray–Curtis dissimilarity, but the relative abundances of individual taxa were altered in a diet‐specific manner: overfeeding saturated fat increased Proteobacteria, while unsaturated fat increased butyrate producers. Sugar overfeeding increased Lactococcus and Escherichia coli. Imputed functions of the gut microbiota were not affected by overfeeding. Several taxa affected by overfeeding significantly correlated with the changes in host metabolic markers. The baseline levels of proteobacterial family Desulfovibrionaceae, and especially genus Bilophila, were significantly associated to overfeeding‐induced liver fat increase independently of the diet arm. In general, limited overlap was observed between the overfeeding‐induced microbiota changes and the liver fat‐associated microbiota features at baseline. Conclusions: Our work indicates that the human gut microbiota is resilient to short‐term overfeeding on community level, but specific taxa are altered on diet composition‐dependent manner. Generalizable microbiota signatures directly associated with liver steatosis could not be identified. Instead, the carriage of Bilophila was identified as a potential novel risk factor for diet‐induced liver steatosis in humans.

Study hypothesis: Through the administration of specific probiotics, the immune response against the coronavirus COVID‐19 could be stimulated, being able to decrease its viral load and secondary symptomatology. There is a different way to attack a harmful microorganism. It is based on the existence in its habitat of a whole complex network of other microorganisms, our microbiota, which prevents the development, growth and feeding of that microorganism, either by competition of space, food, or immune effects. In COVID‐19 patients, intestinal dysbiosis has been described, specifically observing the decrease of species considered as probiotics of the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. The current study proposes the testing of the novel nutritional supplement to potential the patient's immune system and balances the damaged microbiota. This product contains species from the genera described as affected in the COVID‐19 infection. Moreover, the strains selected showed an anti‐inflammatory and antioxidant effect, and capacity for stimulation of the immune system in previous assays. All three strains have the GRAS status recognized by the FDA and are on the EFSA QPS list. The product also contains vitamin D, zinc and selenium, three powerful inducers of the immune response. It is a safe product according to WHO criteria. In addition, it can be effective despite the administration of antibiotics, due to postbiotic activity, reducing the risk of sepsis described in this type of patient. In order to monitor the effects of treatment with the functional product, a follow‐up will be made by means of consultation regarding the evolution of the patient's condition. On the other hand, we will try to correlate this state with the viral load present in serum and pharyngeal‐nasal scraping. 2. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Main objective: The main objective of the study is to evaluate the capacity of the novel nutritional supplement (immune system enhancer, antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory capacity) to decrease the viral load by nasopharyngeal smear in patients admitted for COVID‐19 coronavirus disease. The Patient will follow the medication agreed by the Hospital committee during all the process. Secondary objectives: Monitoring of changes, in patients admitted by COVID‐19+, of the following parameters at admission and prior to discharge: ‐ Hospital stay (days). Stay in Intensive Care Unit (days) ‐ Clinical indicators: Respiratory rate, body temperature, number of bowel movements and consistency. Abdominal pain. Nausea and vomiting. Sat02. ‐ Type of respiratory support on day 5 of admission: ambient air (none), nasal mask, ventimask, reservoir, non‐invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV), orotracheal intubation. ‐ Analytical parameters at admission and discharge: Total lymphocytes, Hemoglobin, Ferritin, Neutrophils, Urea/Creatinine, C‐reactive protein, LDH, D‐dimer, AST/ALT, Platelets. ‐ Determination of the incidence of mortality in the patient cohort and comparison with that described in the literature. 3. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY STUDY VARIABLES 3. 1. Primary study variable ‐ Viral load during the period of admission to the nasopharyngeal smear. 3. 2. Secondary study variables ‐ Hospital stay (days). Stay in Intensive Care Unit (days). ‐ Clinical indicators on admission and every 48 hours thereafter: Respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, body temperature, number of bowel movements and consistency. Abdominal pain. Nausea and vomiting. ‐ Type of respiratory support on the 5th day of admission: ambient air (none), nasal glasses, ventimask, reservoir, non‐invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV), orotracheal intubation. ‐ Mortality. ‐ Analytical parameters at day 0 and at hospital discharge: Total lymphocytes, ferritin, hemoglobin, neutrophils, urea/creatinine, C‐reactive protein, IL‐6, LDH, D‐dimer, AST/ALT, platelets ‐ Appearance of side effects. 4. MATERIAL AND METHODS 4.1. Study design Randomized clinical trial with a clinical intervention of prescription of functional novel nutritional supplement. The expected duration is 3 months in all patients presenting symptoms of infection by COVID‐19 or COVID+. Serum viral load will be analyzed by rt‐qPCR (reverse transcriptase quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) at the beginning of the patient's admission and every 48 hours until remission of the infection and pharyngeal‐nasal exudate. The patient medicated according to hospital protocol will also be given a daily dose (one sachet) until remission of the illness or for one month. 4.2. Sample size of the study According to GRANMO Sample Size Calculator (Version 7.12 April 2012) Accepting an alpha risk of 0.15 and a beta risk of 0.3 in a bilateral contrast, 48 subjects in the first group and 48 in the second are required to detect the difference between two proportions as statistically significant, than for group 1 (intervention group) it is expected to be 0.5 and group 2 0.7. A follow‐up loss rate of 5% has been estimated. The ARCOSENE approach has been used. 4.3. Statistical plan Quantitative variables will be expressed as mean and standard deviation assuming normal distribution based on the central limit theorem. Qualitative variables will be expressed as frequencies with their 95% confidence intervals. Qualitative variables will be compared using the Chi‐square test. Quantitative variables will be compared using the Student T test. In order to evaluate the impact of the intervention on the evolution of the disease by COVID‐19, on average stay, clinical variables and qualitative and quantitative analyses, a multivariate analysis will be carried out, in which it will be controlled by different variables that could act as factors of confusion (age, sex, type of disease, severity of the disease on admission, other diseases that could affect the evolution, medical treatment, previous surgeries, etc.) 4.4. Planning the physical‐sample drawing Main evaluation criteria: These patients will have their surgery performed pharyngeal‐nasal smear on day 0 and day 5 of hospital admission. Viral load testing and cytokines: In the samples, the viral load will be determined by rt‐qPCR, in hospital services. Cytokines shall be measured at the indication of the physician when deemed appropriate. 5. ETHICAL ASPECTS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE STUDY PROTOCOL 5.1 Ethical conduct of the study The study will be carried out in accordance with the following guidelines: ‐ Local ethical standards. ‐ European directives on the protection of human subjects in research. ‐ Declaration of Helsinki. ‐ The study will be conducted in strict accordance with the international ethical recommendations for human research and clinical trials set out in the Declaration of Helsinki, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Ministry of Health on clinical trials. ‐ Recommendations of the European Network of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance Centres ‐ GMP recommendations. ‐ Other relevant guidelines, laws or regulations applicable in each country and in the Valencian Community As it is a research project with a nutritional supplement, it is not considered a medicine or a health product, and therefore the Biomedical Research Law applies to it and not the EECC RD 1090/2015.

EED can contribute to stunting through reduced digestion and absorption of nutrients, increased susceptibility to infections, increased systemic inflammation and inhibition of growth hormones. EED can be apparent by age 12 weeks, highlighting the need for early intervention. Modulating the early life gut microbiota using synbiotics may improve resistance against colonisation of the gut by enteropathogens, reduce EED and improve linear growth. Methods and analysis An individually randomised, two‐arm, open‐label, controlled trial will be conducted in Kaffrine District, Senegal. Infants will be recruited at birth and randomised to either receive a synbiotic containing two Bifidobacterium strains and one Lactobacillus strain, or no intervention, during the first 6 months of life. The impact of the intervention will be evaluated primarily by comparing length‐for‐age z‐score at 12 months of age in infants in the intervention and control arms of the trial. Secondary outcome variables include biomarkers of intestinal inflammation, intestinal integrity and permeability, gut microbiota profiles, presence of enteropathogens, systemic inflammation, growth hormones, epigenetic status and episodes of illness during follow‐up to age 24 months. Discussion This trial will contribute to the evidence base on the use of a synbiotic to improve linear growth by preventing or ameliorating EED in a low‐resource setting.

In contrast, VE303 is a defined consortium of eight purified, clonal bacterial strains developed for prevention of rCDI. In the phase 2 CONSORTIUM study, high‐dose VE303 was well tolerated and reduced the odds of rCDI by more than 80% compared to placebo. VE303 organisms robustly colonized the gut in the high‐dose group and were among the top taxa associated with non‐recurrence. Multi‐omic modeling identified antibiotic history, baseline stool metabolites and serum cytokines as predictors of both on‐study CDI recurrence and VE303 colonization. VE303 potentiated early recovery of the host microbiome and metabolites with increases in short‐chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids and bile salt hydrolase genes after antibiotic treatment for CDI, which is considered important to prevent CDI recurrences.

These exposures, however, can select for antibiotic‐resistant bacteria in the gut microbiota. METHODS: Our previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a rapid‐test‐and‐treat strategy for severe acute diarrheal disease in children in Botswana included an intervention (3‐day azithromycin dose) group and a control group that received supportive treatment. In this prospective matched cohort study using stools collected at baseline and 60 days after treatment from RCT participants, the collection of antibiotic resistance genes or resistome was compared between groups. RESULTS: Certain macrolide resistance genes increased in prevalence by 13%‐55% at 60 days, without differences in gene presence between the intervention and control groups. These genes were linked to tetracycline resistance genes and mobile genetic elements. CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin treatment for bacterial diarrhea for young children in Botswana resulted in similar effects on the gut resistome as the supportive treatment and did not provide additional selective pressure for macrolide resistance gene maintenance. The gut microbiota of these children contains diverse macrolide resistance genes that may be transferred within the gut upon repeated exposures to azithromycin or coselected by other antibiotics.

METHODS: Client‐owned dogs presenting to veterinary clinics from households in France, Hungary and Germany were screened for intestinal nematodes. Dogs with an initial positive faecal egg count that was subsequently confirmed with a follow‐up faecal examination to demonstrate the presence of naturally occurring mixed or mono‐infections with Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Trichuris vulpis or Ancylostoma caninum were enrolled on Day 0 into the study. Households were randomised in an approximately 2:1 ratio to receive either an investigational product (IP; Credelio Plus tablets) or control product (CP; Nexgard Spectra® tablets) as treatment. Dogs were administered the IP (n = 278) or CP (n = 117) once on Day 0 at a dose rate of 0.75‐1.56 mg/kg bodyweight milbemycin oxime and 20.0‐41.5 mg/kg bodyweight lotilaner (IP) or as recommended (CP). Effectiveness of the IP and CP treatments was based on the post‐treatment reduction in geometric mean faecal egg counts on Day 8 (range Day 7‐10) after treatment as compared to their pre‐treatment nematode faecal egg counts. RESULTS: Geometric mean (GM) faecal egg counts for T. canis, A caninum and T. vulpis were reduced by ≥ 97.2% in the Credelio Plus group and  by ≥ 95.3% in the afoxolaner + milbemycin oxime group. There were insufficient data to calculate a percentage reduction in GM faecal egg counts between Day 0 and Day 8 for T. leonina due to low prevalence.

One of the identified strategies to prevent diarrhoea is hand washing. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of hand‐washing promotion interventions on diarrhoeal episodes in children and adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP), and metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) on 8 January 2020, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Individually‐randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs that compared the effects of hand‐washing interventions on diarrhoea episodes in children and adults with no intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We stratified the analyses for child day‐care centres or schools, community, and hospital‐based settings. Where appropriate, we pooled incidence rate ratios (IRRs) using the generic inverse variance method and a random‐effects model with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included 29 RCTs: 13 trials from child day‐care centres or schools in mainly high‐income countries (54,471 participants), 15 community‐based trials in LMICs (29,347 participants), and one hospital‐based trial among people with AIDS in a high‐income country (148 participants). All the trials and follow‐up assessments were of short‐term duration. Hand‐washing promotion (education activities, sometimes with provision of soap) at child day‐care facilities or schools prevent around one‐third of diarrhoea episodes in high‐income countries (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.85; 9 trials, 4664 participants, high‐certainty evidence) and may prevent a similar proportion in LMICs, but only two trials from urban Egypt and Kenya have evaluated this (IRR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.99; 2 trials, 45,380 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Only four trials reported measures of behaviour change, and the methods of data collection were susceptible to bias. In one trial from the USA hand‐washing behaviour was reported to improve; and in the trial from Kenya that provided free soap, hand washing did not increase, but soap use did (data not pooled; 3 trials, 1845 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Hand‐washing promotion among communities in LMICs probably prevents around one‐quarter of diarrhoea episodes (IRR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.81; 9 trials, 15,950 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, six of these nine trials were from Asian settings, with only one trial from South America and two trials from sub‐Saharan Africa. In seven trials, soap was provided free alongside hand‐washing education, and the overall average effect size was larger than in the two trials which did not provide soap (soap provided: RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.75; 7 trials, 12,646 participants; education only: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.05; 2 trials, 3304 participants). There was increased hand washing at major prompts (before eating or cooking, after visiting the toilet, or cleaning the baby's bottom) and increased compliance with hand‐hygiene procedure (behavioural outcome) in the intervention groups compared with the control in community trials (data not pooled: 4 trials, 3591 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Hand‐washing promotion for the one trial conducted in a hospital among a high‐risk population showed significant reduction in mean episodes of diarrhoea (1.68 fewer) in the intervention group (mean difference ‐1.68, 95% CI ‐1.93 to ‐1.43; 1 trial, 148 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Hand‐washing frequency increased to seven times a day in the intervention group versus three times a day in the control arm in this hospital trial (1 trial, 148 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We found no trials evaluating the effects of hand‐washing promotions on diarrhoea‐related deaths or cost effectiveness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Hand‐washing promotion probably reduces diarrhoea episodes in both child day‐care centres in high‐income countries and among communities living in LMICs by about 30%. The included trials do not provide evidence about the long‐term impact of the interventions.",12,1,CD004265,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 33539552,EMBASE 634196564,,,,Journal article,*diarrhea; *hand washing; Acquired immune deficiency syndrome; Adult; Behavior change; Bias; Child; Child Day Care Centers [statistics & numerical data]; Clinical trial registry; Community‐Acquired Infections [prevention & control]; Controlled study; Cooking; Cost effectiveness analysis; Cross Infection [prevention & control]; Day care; Developed Countries [statistics & numerical data]; Developing Countries [statistics & numerical data]; Diarrhea [*prevention & control]; Eating; Education; Effect size; Egypt; Eligibility; Embase; Female; Follow up; GRADE approach; Hand Disinfection [*methods]; High income country; High risk population; Human; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Kenya; Major clinical study; Male; Medline; Middle income country; Prevention; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Randomized controlled trial; Review; Risk assessment; Schools [statistics & numerical data]; Soaps; South America; Toilet; World Health Organization,10.1002/14651858.CD004265.pub4,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02245902/full,

Infectious diseases,2020,"Background: Norovirus and rotavirus are the dominant pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis in children. To quantify their natural disease burden and transmission, we prospectively monitored households in an endemic setting in the Netherlands, a high‐income country that does not have a rotavirus vaccination programme. Methods: We did a prospective, household survey‐based cohort study in the Netherlands. Randomly selected households from the Dutch Population Register were invited to participate if they had at least three household members, including a child younger than 2 years. A member of each household was asked to record the gastrointestinal symptoms of all household members every day for 10 consecutie weeks using an interactive smartphone application. Real‐time detection of acute gastroenteritis onset on the basis of entered symptoms activated requests for the case and one other household member to complete disease questionnaires and provide stool samples. Stool samples were analysed by real‐time PCR for norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus 40/41, and astrovirus. We calculated the per‐pathogen proportion of households with at least one secondary acute gastroenteritis episode (epidemiologically but not microbiologically linked), the probability of a secondary episode in household members at risk (secondary attack rate), and the microbiologically confirmed symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission rates. Findings: During two seasons (January to March) in 2016 and 2017, 30 660 households were invited to participate, of which 604 households including 2298 individuals were enrolled. 697 acute gastroenteritis episodes were detected in 358 households, with samples obtained from 609 (87%) of 697 episodes. Norovirus (150 [25%] of 609 cases) and rotavirus (91 [15%] cases) were most frequently detected. Astrovirus was detected in 50 (8%) samples and adenovirus 40/41 in 24 (4%) samples. Overall disease severity was higher in patients with rotavirus‐positive acute gastroenteritis than those with norovirus‐positive acute gastroenteritis. Norovirus led to higher disease burden in adults than did rotavirus. Following an index case, a secondary acute gastroenteritis episode occurred in 34 (35%) of 96 households for norovirus and 26 (46%) of 56 households for rotavirus. Secondary attack rates were 15% (37 of 244 participants) for norovirus and 28% (33 of 120 participants) for rotavirus and asymptomatic transmission rates were 51% (52 of 102 household members) for norovirus and 22% (12 of 55 household members) for rotavirus. The microbiologically confirmed symptomatic transmission rate for norovirus was 10% (25 of 254 household members) and 18% for rotavirus (21 of 119 household members). Interpretation: In households with young family members in a setting without rotavirus vaccination, norovirus is the dominant acute gastroenteritis pathogen, but rotavirus is associated with more severe disease.

This study investigated the heterogeneity of these treatments' effects based on individual pathogen and EED biomarker status with respect to child linear growth. METHODS: We applied cross‐validated targeted maximum likelihood estimation and super learner ensemble machine learning to assess the conditional treatment effects in subgroups defined by biomarker and pathogen status. We analyzed treatment (N+WSH, WSH, N, or control) randomly assigned in‐utero, child pathogen and EED data at 14 months of age, and child HAZ at 28 months of age. We estimated the difference in mean child height for age Z‐score (HAZ) under the treatment rule and the difference in stratified treatment effect (treatment effect difference) comparing children with high versus low pathogen/biomarker status while controlling for baseline covariates. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 1,522 children who had a median HAZ of ‐1.56. We found that fecal myeloperoxidase (N+WSH treatment effect difference 0.0007 HAZ, WSH treatment effect difference 0.1032 HAZ, N treatment effect difference 0.0037 HAZ) and Campylobacter infection (N+WSH treatment effect difference 0.0011 HAZ, WSH difference 0.0119 HAZ, N difference 0.0255 HAZ) were associated with greater effect of all interventions on anthropometry. In other words, children with high myeloperoxidase or Campylobacter infection experienced a greater impact of the interventions on anthropometry. We found that a treatment rule that assigned the N+WSH (HAZ difference 0.23, 95% CI (0.05, 0.41)) and WSH (HAZ difference 0.17, 95% CI (0.04, 0.30)) interventions based on EED biomarkers and pathogens increased predicted child growth compared to the randomly allocated intervention. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that EED biomarkers and pathogen status, particularly Campylobacter and myeloperoxidase (a measure of gut inflammation), may be related to the impact of N+WSH, WSH, and N interventions on child linear growth.",19,2,e0012881,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 39965021,,,,,Journal article,"*Hygiene; *Sanitation; Bangladesh [epidemiology]; Biomarkers [analysis]; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Nutritional Status",10.1371/journal.pntd.0012881,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02815681/full,

Specifically, presence or absence of certain gut bacterial taxa has been associated with better antitumor immune responses. Furthermore, in trials using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to treat melanoma patients unresponsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), complete responses (CR), partial responses (PR), and durable stable disease (SD) have been observed. However, the underlying mechanism determining which patients will or will not respond and what the optimal FMT composition is, has not been fully elucidated, and a discrepancy in microbial taxa associated with clinical response has been observed between studies. Furthermore, it is unknown whether a change in the microbiome itself, irrespective of its origin, or FMT from ICI responding donors, is required for reversion of ICI‐unresponsiveness. To address this, we will transfer microbiota of either ICI responder or nonresponder metastatic melanoma patients via FMT. Methods: In this randomized, double‐blinded phase Ib/IIa trial, 24 anti‐PD1‐refractory patients with advanced stage cutaneous melanoma will receive an FMT from either an ICI responding or nonresponding donor, while continuing anti‐PD‐1 treatment. Donors will be selected from patients with metastatic melanoma treated with anti‐PD‐1 therapy. Two patients with a good response (≥ 30% decrease according to RECIST 1.1 within the past 24 months) and two patients with progression (≥ 20% increase according to RECIST 1.1 within the past 3 months) will be selected as ICI responding or nonresponding donors, respectively. The primary endpoint is clinical benefit (SD, PR or CR) at 12 weeks, confirmed on a CT scan at 16 weeks. The secondary endpoint is safety, defined as the occurrence of grade ≥ 3 toxicity. Exploratory endpoints are progression‐free survival and changes in the gut microbiome, metabolome, and immune cells. Discussion: Transplanting fecal microbiota to restore the patients’ perturbed microbiome has proven successful in several indications. However, less is known about the potential role of FMT to improve antitumor immune response. In this trial, we aim to investigate whether administration of FMT can reverse resistance to anti‐PD‐1 treatment in patients with advanced stage melanoma, and whether the ICI‐responsiveness of the feces donor is associated with its effectiveness.

Although the mechanism of FMT is thought to be bacterial engraftment, the best approach to achieve engraftment after FMT in IBS‐D (and other diseases) is not clear. We evaluated the effect of FMT (with or without pretreatment with antibiotics) on gut microbiome and symptoms in patients with IBS‐D. In this randomized, placebo‐controlled, single‐center study, 44 patients with IBS‐D with a least moderate severity (IBS severity scoring system, i.e., IBS‐SSS, ≥175) were randomly assigned to one of four groups: single‐dose oral FMT alone, single‐dose oral FMT following a 7‐day pretreatment course of Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole (CM‐FMT) or Rifaximin (R‐FMT), or Placebo FMT. Primary endpoint was engraftment post‐FMT and secondary endpoints were changes in IBS‐SSS, and IBS‐quality of life (IBS‐QOL) at week 10. Median engraftment was significantly different among the three FMT groups (P = .013). Engraftment post‐FMT was significantly higher in the FMT alone arm (15.5%) compared to that in R‐FMT group (5%, P = .04) and CM‐FMT group (2.4%, P = .002). The mean change in IBS‐SSS and IBS‐QOL from baseline were not significantly different among the four groups or between the three FMT groups combined vs. placebo at week 10.

Southern part of Nepalhas tropical climate suitable for vector‐borne tropical diseases whereas northern partshave more temperate and sub‐arctic climate where these diseases are less common.Additionally, water‐borne diseases have persisted because of a lack of sanitation andsafe drinking water. Most hospitals in Nepal lack support of well equipped. microbiologylaboratories for diagnosis of infectious diseases, and hence, most clinicians treat theirpatients empirically based on their decisions on clinical features alone . A study donein the region has shown poor predictability of clinical features alone to distinguishenteric fever from other causes of febrile illness .Either from the lack of or limited access to confirmatory microbiological tests, majorityof the cases of febrile illnesses in Nepal are diagnosed on clinical basis only. Thesecases of ""undifferentiated fever"" or ""undifferentiated febrile illness"" are treatedempirically without etiological diagnosis. In the absence of correct diagnosis, patientsreceive multiple empirical antibiotics which increase the risk of antibiotic resistanceand adds unnecessary burden of cost to the patients and their families. A hospital‐basedstudy of febrile patients published in 2004 revealed identifiable causes in only 37% ofthe patients.The most common causes of febrile illness in Nepal at the time were enteric fever, murinetyphus, scrub typhus, Leptospirosis, and bacterial infections including Streptococcuspneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Studies show a trend inincreasing cases of rickettsial infections including Rickettsia typhi and Orientiatsutsugamushi.Preliminary work done at Patan Hospital Patan Hospital is a tertiary care medical centerwith 450 beds that admits between 10 to 30 febrile patients per week depending on theseason. Over 30% of these patients do not have localizing signs and symptoms for clinicaldiagnosis nor do they have a laboratory‐based diagnosis. These cases are labelled asundifferentiated fever and receive empirical treatment with two or more antimicrobialagents. Previous studies done at Patan Hospital have demonstrated that Salmonella typhiand Salmonella paratyphi A were causes of undifferentiated fever of >3 days duration in34% patients and Rickettsia typhi in 17% cases, whereas another study in 2008 found 7%cases of febrile illness has Rickettsia typhi, which is the cause of Murine typhus. Thesestudies show an increase in cases of rickettsial infections including Riackettsia typhiand Orientia tsutsugamushi. Studies at Patan Hospital have also identified Streptococcuspneumoniae, Leptospira spp., Orientia tsutsugamushi, Hantavirus, and Coxiella burnetii ascasues of febrile illnesses .Research Gap The epidemiology of infectious disease has changed with massive withincountry urban migrations, increased migrant workers to India and overseas countries,change in climate, and several other reasons. Previous common causes of febrile illnessessuch as malaria and enteric fever have declined over past decade whereas dengue and scrubtyphus are on the rise. Meanwhile, new diseases such as COVID‐19, dengue, and Scrubtyphus have become commonplace [5,10,11].

In Poland, the number of people with mental disorders in outpatientcare has increased by 150,000 in recent years, reaching a total of more than 1.2 millionpatients. The number of people requiring psychological and psychiatric care is expectedto grow in the coming decades. The psychopharmacotherapy used does not always produce theexpected treatment results. As a result, more and more attention is being paid tonon‐pharmacological interactions. In recent years, there has been a growing body ofresearch on the relationship between nutrition and its impact on the mental state ofpeople with mental disorders. Food and nutrition science, psychodietetics andnutripsychiatry, thriving scientific fields, are gaining prominence. Research findingsindicate that nutrition and stress‐coping resources affect an individual's health. Therole of the probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus Helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum aspart of the human microbiome has also been studied in this sphere, and results from agrowing number of papers confirm their wide range of applications and positive effects onvarious domains of health. Previous studies have shown that supplementation withBifidobacterium longum or a composite of them with other bacterial strains positivelyaffected, among other things, the bone health of postmenopausal women, alleviatedgastrointestinal discomfort, reduced perceived stress, and improved depression, anxiety,and mood indicators in adults of various ages. On the other hand, supplementation with acomposite of several bacterial strains, including Lactobacillus Helveticus andBifidobacterium longum, affected reducing fat mass in obese and overweight individuals.Probiotic supplementation appears to have great potential for improving health andquality of life, including the prevention and treatment of depressive and anxietydisorders and the ability to cope with stress. Nevertheless, there is still a lack ofresearch in this area, especially concerning Lactobacillus Helveticus alone and thecombination of Lactobacillus Helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum strains.With this in mind, a research project was planned to investigate the effects of bothprobiotic supplements and dietary quality on a wide range of psychological,microbiological, biochemical, and clinical outcomes. The study aimed to evaluate theeffects of targeted supplementation with a new composition of probiotic strainsLactobacillus Helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum on gut microbiota composition andquality, stress‐related neuroendocrine markers, mental health, perceived stressintensity, psychosomatic response and coping strategies as well as body composition andbone density in young women who differed in diet quality. We hypothesised thatsupplementation with probiotic bacteria at a daily dose of 3 x 109 CFU, irrespective ofdiet quality, would result in changes in the gut microbiota towards higher proportions ofbeneficial bacteria, reduce stress‐related neuroendocrine markers and the intensity ofperceived stress and its psychosomatic symptoms, and improve stress‐coping strategies,mental health potential and have a beneficial effect on body composition components andbone density in healthy young women, compared with placebo.Study design and population This randomized, placebo‐controlled, 2‐arm, parallel,double‐blind intervention trial was conducted in a few waves from September 2023 to March2024 2023 at the Department of Human Nutrition and Dietetics (Poznań Univrsity of LifeSciences). Each wave started during the fall months and was completed during the wintermonths. The sample size was calculated using GPower software (version 3.1.9.7,Universität Düsseldorf, Germany). Briefly, to detect a significant change in perceivedstress level with a two‐sided t‐test, a significance level of 5%, and a statistical powerof 80%, a sample size of 110 was determined, considering a 30% dropout rate. Initially,120 women were enrolled in this study. These were only women in early adulthood.Eligibility criteria for the study included female sex, age 20‐30 years, BMI < 30 kg/m2.Exclusion criteria were: diagnosed chronic and/or serious health disorders (e.g.diabetes, asthma, hypertension, renal diseases), pregnancy, taking any probiotics for 8weeks prior to enrollment to the study protocol, recent and current antibiotic treatment,ore use of pharmaceutical antidepressant treatment. All participants were healthyvolunteers who were fully informed about the study's objectives and provided informedconsent for participation before entering the study. The study protocol was reviewed andapproved by the Bioethics Committee of the Karol Marcinkowski University of MedicalSciences in Poznan, Poland (permission no. 244/23, issued on March 9, 2023). The studycomplies with the CONSORT Statement on randomized trials. All procedures followed theguidelines of the 2013 Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice.The enrolled volunteers were evenly, randomly, and blindly assigned to either theintervention (Lh+Bl) group, receiving probiotic bacteria, or the placebo (PLA) group for12 weeks of supplementation. Randomization was conducted by the supplement manufacturerwith computer‐generated codes using Research Randomizer (www.randomizer.org). The entirestudy protocol included familiarization and two laboratory visits in at the Department ofHuman Nutrition and Dietetics at baseline and at the end of the study (T1, T2;before/after Lh+Bl supplementation [Lh+Bl PRE and Lh+Bl POST] and PLA supplementation[PLAPRE and PLAPOST]). The study's main protocol included an assessment of dietary habitsat the T1 study visit. Measurements of weight, height, body composition, bone density,stress response and stress‐coping strategies, mental health assessment as well as salivaand stool sampling were conducted at each of the T1 and T2 study visits. The primaryoutcome measures are microbiota composition, perceived stress intensity andstress‐related neuroendocrine markers (salivary cortisol, salivary DHEA and salivarycortisol:DHEA ratio, faecal cortisol); the secondary outcome measures are stress‐copingstrategies, psychosomatic symptoms, sense of coherence, body composition and bonedensity). All testing was performed in the morning at the same time for the participant.Participants declared that they had not introduced any changes in their lifestyles,nutrition, or supplementation during the study protocol and were prepared for each visitin the same manner. In addition, telephone contact was maintained in case ofnon‐compliance with the protocol or gastrointestinal symptoms or adverse events.There were 20 dropouts from the study protocol. The main reasons for dropping out wereantibiotic therapy during the protocol (n=10) and discontinuation of the study without areason before the second visit (n=10). There were 11 dropouts in the Lh+Bl and 9 in thePLA groups. Finally, 100 women (23.5 ± 2.7 years; 61.6 ± 9.4 kg body mass; 1.67 ± 0.06 mheight) completed the entire study protocol and were included in the analyses.Supplementation In the experimental procedure, each participant was supplemented with achronic dose of 1 capsule per day of Lh+Bl or PLA in a randomized, parallel sequence.Participants were provided with blister packs of Lh+Bl capsules containing 3 x 109 CFU ofcombined freeze‐dried probiotic strains of the probiotic bacteria Bifidobacterium longumRosell®‐175 and Lactobacillus Helveticus Rosell®‐52 (trade name: Sanprobi®Stress) or PLAcapsules containing an isoenergetic product prepared for the trial. The PLA capsulescontained only potato starch and magnesium stearate as fillers. The capsule shellconsisted of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and the weight of a single capsule was 420 mg.The probiotics were in identical capsules as PLA and could not be distinguished byappearance and taste. Lh+Bl and PLA capsules were obtained from Sanprobi sp. z o.o. sp.k., (Szczecin, Poland). The combination and the concentration of probiotics used in thisstudy were based on the manufacturer's recommendations. The preparations wereadministrated to each participant in envelopes marked with a unique code. According tothe recommended blinding procedure, the formulations were prepared in advance by themanufacturer's laboratory, which was not directly involved in the study. As fordouble‐blinding, neither the researchers nor the participants knew whether Lh+Bl or PLAwas administered. Details of randomization were anonymized and disclosed after theprotocol's cessation.Diet and lifestyleDietary data were collected using the validated KomPAN® food frequency questionnaireposted on the Google Drive file‐sharing platform. The questionnaire included foodscommonly consumed by the Polish population, grouped into 25 food categories. Participantswere asked to select how often they consumed each type of food in the past 12 months.Available frequency responses were converted in daily frequencies and consisted of never(0 times/day), 1‐3 times a month (0.06 times/day), once a week (0.14 times/day), a fewtimes a week (0.5 times/day), once a day (1.0 times/day), or a few times a day (2.0times/day). The diet quality was described by two diet quality scores: the pro‐healthydiet index (pHDI) and the unhealthy diet index (nHDI). Both diet quality scores werecalculated as the sum of daily frequencies (in times/day) of food item consumption. ThepHDI included 10 items representing potentially pro‐healthy foods (whole grain bread,whole grain cereals, milk, fermented milk drinks, cottage cheese, white meat, fish,legumes, fruits, and vegetables) with a total score ranging from 0‐20 times/day. The nHDIincluded 14 food items representing potentially unhealthy foods (white bread, refinedcereals, fast food, fried foods, butter, lard, cheese, cold cuts, red meat, sweets,canned meats, sweetened beverages, energy drinks, alcohol) with a total score range 0‐28times/day. Both diet quality scores were recalculated to standardize the total scorerange to 0‐100 points for each. The following formulas were used:pHDI (in points) = (100/20) × sum of the frequency of consumption of 10 food items(times/day) nHDI (in points) = (100/28) × sum of the frequency of consumption of 14 fooditems (times/day) Estimated lifestyle behaviors included frequency of daily meals,snacking, salt and sugar use, physical activity, smoking, etc.Body mass and body composition assessment Anthropometric measurements were taken at thebeginning of each study visit to ensure equal conditions for the test procedures. Beforebody composition analysis, weight and height were measured to the nearest 0.1 cm and 0.1kg, for height and weight, respectively, using a calibrated scale with a stadiometer(WB3007311, Tanita Corporation, Japan), and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Bodycomposition analysis (FM and FFM) was performed by both dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry(GE Lunar Prodigy device ‐ General Electrics Healthcare Medical Systems, Europe, Belgium)and displacement plethysmography using Bod Pod (Life Measurement Inc., Concord, CA, USA).All measurements were performed in the morning (7:30‐10:00 am) and while fasting (waterintake was recommended), with the ambient temperature maintained at 20‐22 °C. Allparticipants avoided strenuous exercise for at least 24 hours prior to each visit.Bone mineral density measurements All study participants underwent dual‐energy X‐rayabsorptiometry (DXA) by the same technician using a GE Lunar Prodigy densitometer(General Electrics Healthcare Medical Systems, Europe, Belgium). The effective dose (μSv)for this densitometer is 0.05. Parameters obtained from the measurement included bonemineral content (BMC, g) and bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm2). BMD Z‐scores weregenerated using the sex‐, race‐, and age‐specific normative DXA database software Enco.The International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) standards recommend the use ofZ‐scores to assess BMD in premenopausal women. Bone mineral density (BMD) was compared tohealthy young women at each measurement (lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, radius)and a T‐score was calculated. According to the World Health Organization definition,osteoporosis is indicated by a T‐score less than ‐2.5 SD, and osteopenia by a T‐scorebetween ‐1 and ‐2.5 SD. Bone parameters were measured according to the adopteddensitometry methodology and the International Society for Clinical Densitometryrecommendations. A standard quality control program was used, which included checking theDXA equipment to verify system stability and a visual review of all images by anexperienced examiner. The scanner was calibrated daily as the DXA GE Lunar Prodigymanufacturer recommended. A standard calibration block was used. The study was performedby a team with the necessary certifications to perform peripheral and axial densitometryand experience in densitometry.Saliva collection and sample analysis Stress‐related neuroendocrine markers, namelysalivary cortisol and DHEA, will be measured, as well as the cortisol:DHEA ratio. Priorto saliva collection in the laboratory, participants were instructed to refrain fromconsuming caffeine and/or nicotine for at least 4 hours and alcohol for at least 24hours. Unstimulated saliva samples were collected from fasting participants in disposableEppendorf plastic tubes using the spitting method for 10 minutes while the subjectsrested. Participants were first asked to rinse their mouths with water for approximately30 seconds and 10 minutes prior to providing a saliva sample. Saliva was collectedbetween 9:00 and 11:00 am to minimize circadian differences. Samples of the material (2tubes per person), immediately after collection, were placed in a freezer at ‐80°C andstored until shipment to the laboratory (SANPROBI Research and Development Center inSzczecin). Prior to analysis, samples will be warmed and centrifuged at 1000 x g for 20minutes to remove particulate material. Cortisol and DHEA in human saliva will bemeasured with commercially available kits using an immunoenzymatic method according tothe manufacturer's instructions. All samples will be processed in duplicate during thesame assay. Statistical analyses will be performed using the mean of the two replicatemeasurements. Raw values will be log‐transformed, and observations greater than three SDsfrom the mean for each sampling time will be excluded.Faecal sample collection and microbiota and cortisol analysis Faecal sampling was carriedout as follows: feces were collected at home on the day of arrival at the laboratory orthe day before, cooled immediately after defecation in the test subject's refrigeratorand transferred to the laboratory. Samples were stored at ‐80 ◦C until analysis. Analysisof the gut microbiota will be performed in SANPROBI Research and Development Centerlaboratory in Szczecin using Illumina next‐generation sequencing technology. DNAextraction from the faecal sample will be performed using commercially availableisolation kits, followed by an assessment of the quality (integrity) of the isolate. Thenext step is DNA amplification by PCR using specific primers complementary to conservedgene sequences on either side of the target region. The V2 and V3 hypervariable fragmentsof the region, consisting of approximately 400‐500 base pairs of the prokaryotic 16S rRNgene, are duplicated. The amplicons from each sample are barcoded with a short ""barcode""sequence unique to each sample. Finally, high‐throughput ""multiplexed"" sequencing of allsamples is performed in a single sequencing run.Faecal samples for cortisol analysis will be warmed and diluted with water, and thesubsequent procedure is the same as for saliva samples prepared for cortisol analysis, asdescribed above.Personality dimensions The Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) scale is a validated10‐item self‐administered questionnaire designed to evaluate the psychosocial factors.The TIPI was designed by Gosling et al. as a brief instrument to measure the Big Fivepersonality dimensions with two items for each trait (a standard item and areverse‐scored item in each trait). These personality dimensions comprise extraversion(being social, enthusiastic), agreeableness (trustworthiness, being empathetic),conscientiousness (self‐discipline, reliability, self‐efficacy), emotional stability (theopposite dimension to neuroticism; being balanced, calm, capability of remaining stable),and openness (curiosity and creativity, being open‐minded). The responses in thepersonality scale were measured on a seven‐point Likert scale and scored as 1= stronglydisagree, 2 = disagree moderately, 3 = disagree a little, 4 = neither agree nor disagree,5 = agree a little, 6 = agree moderately, 7 = agree strongly. Responses to reverse‐scoreditems were recoded to be consistent with standard items. Then, the average of thestandard item and the recoded reverse‐scored item were calculated to make up eachdimension's scale score, which ranged from 1 to 7. Higher scale scores reflect a higherlevel of each trait.Each TIPI scale score was categorized by the conceptual approach, which was dividing thescale according to whether the scores were equal to being ""agree"" or higher (on average)to create two categories: lower TIPI (<5 as disagree) and higher TIPI categories (5‐7 asagree). Any dimension scale score that produced agree and higher scores indicated ahigher level of that trait and were considered as a higher TIPI category.Thisquestionnaire's internal reliability with a Cronbach's alpha value was 0.59. The TIPIquestionnaire was administered only once during the initial T1 visit.Perceived stress and mental health assessment We collected 5 self‐report (sub)scalesrelated to broad domains of perceived stress and physical/mental health: Perceived StressScale (PSS‐10), Brief Coping Orientations To Problems Experienced Inventory (Brief‐COPE),Sense of Coherence 13‐item scale (SOC‐13), General Health Questionnaire GHQ‐28, and TenItem Personality Inventory (TIPI). All tests (in a standardized Polish version) werebased on self‐assessment questionnaires posted on the Google Drive file‐sharing platform.The PSS‐10 form was used to assess the intensity of stress related to one's own lifeexperiences in the past month and was a modified version of the Perceived Stress Scaledeveloped by Cohen. Respondents reported on a 5‐point Likert scale (0 = never, 1 = almostnever, 2 = sometimes, 3 = quite often, 4 = very often) the extent to which situations intheir lives during the past month were unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overwhelming.The scores for the four positively identified items (items 4, 5, 7, 8) are reversed. Themaximum score is 40, with higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived stress.According to the instructions, scores in the range of 0‐13 indicate a low level ofstress, scores in the range of 14‐26 indicate a moderate level of stress, and scores inthe range of 27‐40 indicate a high level of perceived stress. In this study, the scalehad a Cronbach's alpha (α) of 0.85. Scores on the scale were compared between the initialand final assessments.The Brief COPE is a shortened 28‐item version of the COPE Inventory questionnaire byCarver et al. and was used to assess situational coping strategies (ways people cope witha specific stressful event) and dispositional coping strategies (usual ways people copewith stress in everyday life). In its original version, this inventory revealed adequatelevels of internal consistency, in addition to showing proof of the validity of itsfactor structure. We used Mini‐COPE, the shortened Polish version of COPE Inventoryquestionnaire.The scale measures 14 theoretically or empirically grounded copingstrategies (coping subscales, each with two items): self‐distraction, active coping,denial, substance use, emotional support, instrumental support, behavioral disengagement,venting, positive reframing, planning, humor, acceptance, religion, and self‐blame. Foreach item, respondents indicate whether they use the coping response on a four‐pointLikert scale (0 = I usually do not do this almost at all; 1 = I usually do this rarely; 2= I usually do this often; 3 = I usually do this almost always).These subscales were futher categorized into second‐order factor model, which consistedof ""Adaptive coping strategies"" (use of emotional support, positive reframing,acceptance, religion, humor, active coping, planning, and use of instrumental support)and ""Maladaptive coping strategies"" (venting, denial, substance use, behaviouraldisengagement, self‐distraction, and self‐blame). Cronbach's alpha for the originalsubscales ranged from 0.66 to 0.70. The overall score of each coping strategy is the sumof the scores of two items.The Sense of Coherence Scale SOC‐13 is a 13‐item scale adapted from a longer 29‐itemscale developed by Antonovsky. This scale is a self‐report questionnaire and consists ofthree subscales: meaningfulness (four items), comprehensibility (five items), andmanageability (four items). Each item contains responses that change between questionsand are rated from 1 to 7 on a Likert scale. Five variables (items 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10)are negatively worded and are therefore reverse‐coded when items are summed to obtain anitem total. SOC was calculated as the mean for each individual who had answered at least10 of the 13 items (range, 1.0‐7.0) A higher score represents a greater sense ofcoherence. Studies of the psychometric properties of the SOC‐13 scale have shown highlevels of validity and reliability, and internal consistency is very good, withCronbach's alphas ranging from 0.70 to 0.92 in the 127 studies using the SOC‐13. In thecurrent study, reliability estimates for this scale range from α = 0.77‐0.79.The GHQ‐28 General Health Questionnaire was developed by Goldberg in 1978. It is ameasure of emotional distress over the past few weeks that contains 28 items and could beused as a community screening tool and for the detection of non‐specific psychiatricdisorders among individuals in primary care setting. Participants were asked aboutsymptoms and/or discomfort they had recently experienced. Each item is rated on a 4‐pointLikert scale to indicate symptom severity from 0 to 3 (0 = not at all, 1 = not more thanusual, 2 = a little more than usual, 3 = much more than usual). Scores for the sevenpositively identified items (items 4, 5, 7, 8) are reversed (1=more than usual, 2=asusual, 3=less than usual, 4=much less than usual). Items are summed across foursubscales: somatic symptoms (items 1‐7), anxiety/insomnia (items 8‐14), socialdysfunction (items 15‐21), and major depression (items 22‐28). A high GHQ‐28 scoreindicates a probable psychiatric case. Normative data for the general populationevaluated indicates a cutoff point ≥ 5. Reliability was calculated using Cronbach alphacoefficient and was 0.89‐0.90.Socioeconomic status and stressful events An additional questionnaire was formulated bythe authors, including socioeconomic status (SES) (age, place of residence, familystatus, level of education) and questions on any stressful events (SEs) experiencedduring the previous month.Statistical analysis Continuous variables are presented as mean and standard deviationand variables from scaling as medians and interquartile ranges (25% to 75%). Categoricalvariables are presented as frequencies. Differences among categorical variables areanalyzed by Fisher's exact test. All continuous variables are tested for normaldistribution using the Shapiro‐Wilk test, as well as kurtosis, skewness, and a graphicalevaluation of the distribution of each variable data. Data transformation procedures(e.g., Box‐Cox transformation) are considered if they result in a normal distribution ofall transformed variables. Comparisons between baseline and post‐supplementation timepoints (T1 and T2 visits) in the Lh+Bl or PLA groups are determined using the T‐test fordependent variables and effect size expressed as Cohen's d. Comparisons between groups inpre‐post changes within variables are determined using the T‐test for independentvariables. If normality is violated, data are analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed‐ranktest with effect size expressed as the rank correlation coefficient (rc). Mann‐Whitney Utest is used to compare the variables to test for differences between the placebo andprebiotic groups. An alpha of <0.05 is considered statistically significant. Data areanalyzed using STATISTICA 13.3 software (StatSoft Inc., USA).",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT06860581,,,Trial registry record,,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02818254/full,

Addition of probiotics as adjuvants for H. pylori antibiotic treatment can increase eradication rate and decrease treatment side effects. Although many studies show the benefits of S. boulardii CNCM I‐745 in the treatment of H. pylori infection, the mechanism by which those benefits are achieved is unknown. Here, we report clinical characteristics and fecal microbiota changes comparing conventional anti‐H. pylori therapy versus conventional therapy supplemented with S. boulardii CNCM I‐745. A total of 74 patients were included in the current study; patients positive for H. pylori (n = 63) were randomly assigned to 2 groups: 34 patients received conventional therapy and 29 antibiotic therapy plus 750 mg of S. boulardii CNCM I‐745 daily, for 2 weeks. Eleven patients negative for H. pylori infection were also studied. Patients provided 3 fecal samples: before initiating the antibiotic treatment, upon its completion, and 1 month after treatment. Patients were contacted every 72 h to inquire about side effects and compliance. DNA was extracted, and 16S rRNA was amplified and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq. Bioinformatic analysis was performed using QIIME2. Patients who received the probiotic had a significantly lower frequency of associated gastrointestinal symptoms (P = 0.028); higher number of bacterial diversity evenness (P = 0.0156); higher abundance of Enterobacteria; and lower abundance of Bacteroides and Clostridia upon treatment completion.

This study aims to elucidate the role of Limosilactobacillus fermentum MN‐LF23 (MN‐LF23) in Hp‐infected populations. METHODS: A total of 94 adult patients with confirmed Hp infection were enrolled in this study and randomly allocated to the placebo or MN‐LF23 group. Patients initially received either placebo or probiotics along with standard quadruple therapy for 2 weeks, followed by continued administration of either placebo or probiotics for an additional 4 weeks. The eradication of Hp, serum levels of inflammatory factors, and alterations in gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed at weeks 0, 2, and 6, while fecal samples were collected for metagenomic sequencing. RESULTS: The results showed no significant difference (P = 1) in the eradication rate between the placebo group (85.11%) and the probiotic group (82.98%). Following treatment, the incidence of constipation, dyspepsia, and Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) scores in the probiotic group were markedly lower (P < 0.05) compared to those observed in the placebo group. Throughout the treatment process, there were no significant differences in TNF‐α and IL‐1β levels between the two groups. Compared to the placebo group, the probiotic group exhibited a significant increase in beneficial bacteria such as Limosilactobacillus fermentum, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium longum, Coprococcus caltus, and Clostridium butyricum. CONCLUSION: MN‐LF23 supplementation did not improve the eradication rate of standard quadruple therapy.

External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to prostate extends OS in men with metastatic hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) limited to less than 4 metastases. We hypothesized that combination radium‐223 + pelvic EBRT could safely deliver maximal radiotherapy doses to primary and metastatic prostate cancer and may improve disease control. Patients and Methods: Thirty patients with de novo bone metastatic mHSPC who had commenced androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and docetaxel were recruited to this single‐arm, open‐label, prospective clinical trial: Neo‐adjuvant Androgen Deprivation Therapy, Pelvic Radiotherapy and RADium‐223 (ADRRAD; for new presentation T1‐4 N0‐1 M1B adenocarcinoma of prostate). Study treatments were: ADT, 6 cycles of radium‐223 q28 days, conventionally fractionated prostate radiotherapy (74 Gy) and simultaneous integrated boost to pelvic lymph nodes (60 Gy). Results: No grade 4/5 toxicity was observed. Three patients experienced grade 3 leukopenia, and 1 each experienced grade 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia; all were asymptomatic. One patient each experienced grade 3 dysuria and grade 3 urinary infection. No grade 3 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was observed.

Methods. We tested stool samples collected at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of age and during diarrhea using quantitative molecular diagnostics for 29 pathogens. We estimated the effects of the WASH, IYCF, and combined WASH + IYCF interventions on individual enteropathogen prevalence and quantity, total numbers of pathogens detected, and incidence of pathogen‐attributable diarrhea. Results. WASH interventions decreased the number of parasites detected (difference in number compared to non‐WASH arms, ‐0.07 [95% confidence interval, ‐.14 to ‐.02]), but had no statistically significant effects on bacteria, viruses, or the prevalence and quantity of individual enteropathogens after accounting for multiple comparisons. IYCF interventions had no significant effects on individual or total enteropathogens. Neither intervention had significant effects on pathogen‐attributable diarrhea. Conclusions. The WASH interventions implemented in SHINE (improved pit latrine, hand‐washing stations, liquid soap, pointof‐ use water chlorination, and clean play space) did not prevent enteric infections.

Faecal microbiota transplantation restores gut microbiota and may lead to faster resolution of diarrhoea. METHODS: Into this prospective, multi‐centre, randomized controlled trial we will enrol 36 critically ill patients with antibiotic‐associated diarrhoea. We will exclude patients with ongoing sepsis, need of systemic antibiotics, or those after recent bowel surgery or any other reason that prevents the FMT. Randomisation will be in 1:1 ratio. Patients in the control group will receive standard treatment based on oral diosmectite. In the intervention group, patients will receive, in addition to the standard of care, faecal microbiota transplantation via rectal tube, in the form of a preparation mixed from 7 thawed aliquots (50 mL) made from fresh stool of 7 healthy unrelated donors and quarantined deep frozen for 3 to 12 months. Primary outcome is treatment failure defined as intervention not delivered or diarrhoea persisting at day 7 after randomisation. Secondary outcomes include safety measures such as systemic inflammatory response, adverse events, and also diarrhoea recurrence within 28 days. Exploratory outcomes focus on gut barrier function and composition of intestinal microbiota. DISCUSSION: Faecal microbiota transplantation has been effective for dysbiosis in non‐critically ill patients with recurrent C. difficile infections and it is plausible to hypothesize that it will be equally effective for symptoms of dysbiosis in the critically ill patients. In addition, animal experiments and observational data suggest other benefits such as reduced colonization with multi‐drug resistant bacteria and improved gut barrier and immune function. The frozen faeces from unrelated donors are immediately available when needed, unlike those from the relatives, who require lengthy investigation. Using multiple donors maximises graft microbiota diversity.

Global health,2021,"Background: Diarrhoeal diseases are an important cause of mortality in children younger than 5 years in sub‐Saharan Africa. We aimed to evaluate the effect of three handwashing interventions on handwashing with soap (HWWS) after toilet use. Methods: In this cluster randomised trial in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, we randomly assigned communal housing compounds (1:1:1) to receive one of three interventions: a theory of normative social behaviour (TNSB) intervention, including provision of handwashing stations; handwashing stations only; and no intervention. The TNSB intervention was designed to shift the outcome expectation associated with HWWS from health to riddance of faeces‐related disgust, and to increase the perceived descriptive norm and perceived handwashing publicness. Participants and fieldworkers were masked to the study objectives. The primary outcome was HWWS after toilet use, assessed at 1 month and 5 months follow‐ups. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, PACTR201501000892239. Findings: Between April 10 and May 22, 2014, we identified 92 eligible compounds, of which 75 compounds were included. Follow‐up data on HWWS were available for 23 compounds for the TNSB group, 25 compounds for the handwashing station‐only group, and 25 compounds for the control group. The study ended in April, 2017. Compared with a frequency of 5% (29 of 604 occasions) in the control group, HWWS after toilet use increased to 9% (49 of 557 occasions; adjusted risk ratio 1·89, 95% CI 1·16–3·08) in the handwashing station‐only group, and 24% (143 of 588 occasions; 4·82, 3·06–7·59) in the TNSB group, at the 1‐month follow‐up. The intervention effect was only sustained in the TNSB group (98 [22%] of 450 compounds; 2·68, 1·65–4·34). Interpretation: A social norm‐based handwashing intervention combined with disgust‐inducing messages, with provision of handwashing stations, was effective at increasing HWWS after toilet use. The provision of handwashing stations alone had little effect. Future studies should investigate whether the same approach, when delivered via mass media, can have a similar effect to the face‐to‐face delivery used in this study.

CN-02514623,"NCT05674864,",Effect of Probiotics on Eradication of Persistent H.Pylori Infection,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT05674864,2022,"Over fifty percent of people worldwide are infected with the gram‐negative bacteria Helicobacter pylori. This bacterial infection results in chronic gastritis and is a known risk factor for the development of gastric cancer, the second most lethal disease globally and the fourth most prevalent cancer overall. The incidence and prevalence rates of H. Pylori in Egypt are relatively high, according to a previous study that covered the Delta region of the country, low socioeconomic status, poor sanitation, and fecal contamination of food or water are all associated with a high H. pylori prevalence. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, antibiotic resistance has been significantly rising in several countries as a result of the multiple preventative and treatment procedures being used to manage bacterial pneumonia that co‐exist with the COVID‐19 virus. The incidence of bacterial antibiotic resistance varies locally and seems to be changing over time in various regions, and as a result, the rate of H. pylori eradication worldwide is declining. In about 20% of patients, an initial attempt to eradicate H. pylori fails, leaving them with a persistent infection so, it is crucial to choose medications carefully because H. pylori resistance to previously successful antibiotic treatments is on the rise. Poor nutrition, uncooperative patients, a high bacterial load in the stomach, internalization of germs, gastric acidity, gene polymorphisms, antimicrobial washout, and, most critically, antibiotic resistance are some of the variables that contribute to the failure of H. pylori eradication, severe consequence, and persistent infection. The initial treatment plan, the usage of different antibiotics, and the existence of drug allergies should all be taken into consideration when choosing antibiotic therapy for patients with persistent H. pylori infection. It is normally advised to avoid using antibiotics included in the initial regimen. Amoxicillin can be taken again, though, as resistance seldom arises. According to the 2022 Maastricht VI/Florence consensus report for Management of H. pylori infection, a PPI‐Amoxicillin high‐dose might be an option as rescue therapy, as it overcomes the issue of clarithromycin, metronidazole, or levofloxacin resistance. Fortunately, amoxicillin resistance prevalence as a beta‐lactamase antibiotic has remained low and some studies reported 2% resistance in countries. A Meta‐analysis included 4 RCTs administering PPI‐Amoxicillin dual therapy had an unacceptable eradication rate of 73%, which is comparable to other recommended therapies. While another recent RCT aimed to evaluate the effectiveness, compliance, and safety of High‐Dose Dual Therapy (HDDT) in the management of H. pylori infection as ﬁrst‐line treatment and as rescue therapy, revealed that the effectiveness of HDDT was below 70% in all scenarios (both ﬁrst‐line and rescue treatment) and specifically was 48.4 % per protocol in patients who have been treated with HDDT as rescue treatment for 14 days. However, further Studies are still needed to identify the effectiveness of this regimen, especially with the high antimicrobial resistance during COVID‐19. Probiotics are frequently thought to help with H. pylori eradication and lessen adverse effects caused by standard treatment. Inhibiting H. pylori colonization and adhesion which is important in determining the outcome of H. pylori‐related diseases, decreasing inflammation brought on by H. pylori, modulating the immunological responses of H. pylori, lowering the frequency of side effects, and consequently increasing compliance were a handful possible mechanisms. Probiotics may affect host immune responses by interacting with epithelial cells and regulating the release of anti‐inflammatory cytokines brought on by H. pylori, which may lessen stomach activity and inflammation. The cytokine response first manifests as the production of IL‐8, which causes neutrophils and monocytes to migrate to the mucus. As a result, IL‐4, IL‐5, IL‐6, and INF‐ cytokines are produced by these activated monocytes and dendritic cells. By creating organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, carbon dioxide, and other antimicrobial chemicals, probiotics like lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Bifidobacterium may generally suppress other infections. As an add‐on, Some Lactobacillus species generate bacteriocin‐related antibacterial substances that may have antibacterial properties. In comparison to other strains, certain bacteriocins have more potent antibacterial action against H. pylori. Bacteriocin‐like compound with an antagonistic effect against H. pylori was generated by Enterococcus faecium TM39 which inhibited the development of H. pylori. Previous studies have examined the efficacy and safety of some types of probiotics in helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. But there is no study yet that has examined the efficacy and safety of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus‐ and Bifidobacterium‐containing Probiotic combination on the eradication rate in persistent H. Pylori infection.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT05674864,,,Trial registry record,Communicable Diseases; Helicobacter Infections; Infections,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02514623/full,Complementary Medicine

The intake of polyphenol‐rich foods is proposed as a promising strategy to positively affect the gut microbiota‐immune system‐intestinal barrier (IB) axis. In this context, we tested the hypothesis that a PR‐dietary intervention would affect the presence of bacterial factors in the bloodstream of older adults. METHODS: We collected blood samples within a randomized, controlled, crossover intervention trial in which older volunteers (n = 51) received a polyphenol‐enriched and a control diet. We quantified the presence of bacterial DNA in blood by qPCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene (16S; bacterial DNAemia). Blood DNA was taxonomically profiled via 16S sequencing. RESULTS: Higher blood 16S levels were associated with higher BMI and markers of IP, inflammation, and dyslipidemia. PR‐intervention did not significantly change bacterial DNAemia in the older population (P = 0.103). Nonetheless, the beneficial changes caused by the polyphenol‐enriched diet were greatest in participants with higher bacterial DNAemia, specifically in markers related to IP, inflammation and dyslipidemia, and in fecal bacterial taxa. Finally, we found that the bacterial DNA detected in blood mostly belonged to γ‐Proteobacteria, whose abundance significantly decreased after the polyphenol‐rich diet in subjects with higher bacterial DNAemia at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that older subjects with higher bacterial DNAemia experienced a beneficial effect from a polyphenol‐rich diet. Bacterial DNAemia may be a further relevant marker for the identification of target populations that could benefit more from a protective dietary treatment.

In the Solomon Islands, diarrhoea is the second leading cause of under‐five mortality with about one in every 10 children dying from it before reaching 5 years. This study aims to assess environmental factors that are associated with under‐five diarrhoea prevalence in the Mataniko informal settlements, in Honiara, Solomon Islands. METHODS: Three out of the six settlements along the Mataniko River corridor were randomly selected. Caregivers who were taking care of at least one child under 5 years, and had signed a voluntary informed consent form, were included in the study. Instruments employed to collect the study variables were global positioning system technology and a questionnaire. Each child's medical record was used to verify the date of his or her diarrhoeal status. The data were entered and analysed using SPSS (v23). Binary logistic regression was used to measure the strength of association between under‐five diarrhoea and the independent variables. A p‐value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant (p<0.05). RESULTS: A total of 205 caregivers with at least one child under 5 years participated in the study. Approximately half (45.9%) of the participants reported that their children (<5 years) had suffered with at least one episode of diarrhoea within the 2 weeks prior to the survey. Of the participants, 73.2% did not own a toilet facility and 61.0% of households were built on low‐altitude areas (≤19 m above sea level), and above half (70.6%) were built near (≤125 m) the river. The presence of stagnant wastewater, flies, solid waste and water‐filled containers near households, plus the distance of under‐five households from the river, were found to be directly associated with under‐five diarrhoea in the Mataniko informal settlements (p<0.05).

Methods: This study compared stool microbiota and short‐chain fatty acids (SCFAs) of 37 term infants with CGISCs with 36 term healthy infants (HIs). Two stool samples were collected from each infant: as soon as possible after birth (week 1) and 10–14 days of life (week 2). Results: Bacterial richness and alpha diversity were comparable between CGISCs and HIs at week 1 and week 2 (all p > 0.05). Beta diversity analysis revealed that at week 1, CGISCs had similar community structures to HIs (p = 0.415). However, by week 2, community structures of CGISCs were significantly different from HIs (p = 0.003). At week 1, there were no significant differences in the relative abundances of genera Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides between CGISCs and HIs. At week 2, the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium was significantly lower in CGISCs (mean percentage 7.21 ± 13.49 vs. 28.96 ± 19.6; p = 0.002). Bacteroides were also less abundant in the CGISC group (mean percentage 0.12 ± 0.49 vs. 6.59 ± 8.62; p = 0.039). Relative abundance of genera Pseudomonas and Escherichia–Shigella were higher in CGISCs. At week 2, stool concentrations of all SCFAs were lower in CGISCs (all p < 0.001). Conclusions: During hospitalization, neonates with CGISCs develop gut dysbiosis and deficiency of SCFAs.

AIM: We conducted a pilot study to understand alterations in the gut‐lung axis and to explore the effects of a probiotic in post‐acute COVID‐19 disease. METHODS: We included patients after severe COVID‐19 disease (sCOV, n = 21) in a randomized, placebo‐controlled trial to test the effect of a probiotic (Pro‐Vi 5, Institute Allergosan, Graz, Austria) in a six‐month intervention and used patients after mild disease (mCOV, n = 10) as controls, to compare the intestinal microbiome, metabolome, and patient‐reported outcomes and biomarkers along the gut‐lung axis at baseline and throughout probiotic intervention. RESULTS: Compared to mCOV patients, sCOV patients showed lower microbial richness, which was significantly improved by probiotic intervention. A reorganization of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae taxa was observed in sCOV patients but remained unaffected by the intervention. Serum metabolome showed a dysregulation of lipoproteins in accordance with higher BMI and comorbidities in sCOV patients. HDL and LDL fractions/components were temporarily decreased in the probiotic group. Stool metabolome was altered at baseline in sCOV patients and an increase in L‐DOPA after 3 months and butyrate after 6 months of intervention could be observed. Probiotics partially improved reduced quality of life and modulated altered immune responses in sCOV patients. Increased intestinal permeability at baseline remained unaffected.

Globally, approximately 1.5 billion people are infected with Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura or hookworm. Endemic countries carry out periodic mass treatment of at‐risk populations with albendazole or mebendazole as a control measure. Most prevalence studies have focused on school aged children and therefore control programs are implemented at school level, not at community level. In this study, the prevalence of intestinal helminths, including Strongyloides stercoralis, was examined using a comprehensive laboratory approach in a community in northwestern Ethiopia. Methods A cross‐sectional survey was conducted on 792 individuals ≥5 years old in randomly selected houses in a rural district. Stools were examined using three techniques: a formolether concentration, the Baermann technique and a real time polymerase chain reaction test (these last two specific for S. stercoralis). Statistical analyses were performed between two large age groups, children (≤14 years old) and adults (≥15 years old). Results The prevalence of helminths was 91.3%; (95% CI: 89.3–93.3%). Hookworm was the most prevalent, 78.7% (95% CI 75.6–81.4%), followed by S. stercoralis 55.7% (95% CI 52.2– 59.1%). Co‐infection with both was detected in 45.4% (95% CI 42.0–49.0%) of the participants. The mean age of hookworm‐infected individuals was significantly higher than non‐infected ones (p = 0.003). Also, S. stercoralis infection was significantly associated with age, being more prevalent in adults (p = 0.002). Conclusions This is the highest prevalence of S. stercoralis detected in Ethiopia so far. Our results high‐light the need of searching specifically for infection by this parasite since it usually goes unnoticed if helminth studies rely only on conventional diagnostic techniques, i.e. Kato‐Katz.Moreover, the focus of these programs on children undermines the actual prevalence of hookworm. The adult population acts as a reservoir for both hookworm and S. stercoralis and this fact may negatively impact the current control programs in Ethiopia which only target treatment of school aged children. This reservoir, together with a lack of adequate water, sanitation and hygiene, increases the probability of re‐infection in children. Finally, the high prevalence of S. stercoralis found calls for a comprehensive diagnostic approach in endemicareas in addition to a revision of control measures that is, adding ivermectin to current alben‐dazole/mebendazole, since it is the drug of choice for S. stercoralis.",14,6,e0008315,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 32497042,EMBASE 2004649708,,,,Journal article,"*helminthiasis /epidemiology; *parasite control; *rural population; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Anthelmintics; Article; Ascaris lumbricoides; Blood cell count; Child; Child, Preschool; Controlled study; Cross‐Sectional Studies; Cross‐sectional study; Ethiopia; Ethiopia [epidemiology]; Feces [parasitology]; Female; Follow up; Gene amplification; Geographic distribution; Helminthiasis [*epidemiology, parasitology]; Hookworm Infections [*epidemiology, parasitology]; Human; Humans; Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic [*epidemiology, parasitology]; Major clinical study; Male; Middle Aged; Parasite prevalence; Prevalence; Real time polymerase chain reaction; Rural Population; Schistosoma mansoni; Schistosomiasis mansoni [*epidemiology, parasitology]; Strongyloides stercoralis; Strongyloidiasis [*epidemiology, parasitology]; Trichuris trichiura; Young Adult",10.1371/journal.pntd.0008315,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02138921/full,

We developed an intervention targeting practices relating to food hygiene, mealtime and feeding, and compound cleanliness, each using various behavioural change techniques to influence the uptake of targeted behaviours. Prespecified behavioural outcomes were verified through direct observation, 24 hours recall, and self‐reported picture‐based methods. RESULTS: Compared with control households, a greater proportion of intervention households had a hygienic food preparation area (Risk double difference (RDD) 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.96), had stored food hygienically (RDD 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.00), had a functional handwashing station (RDD 0.64, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.74), provided a safe space for their child to play (RDD 0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.96), and who fed their children thickened porridge (RDD 0.56, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.63) at endline. The proportion of children 6‐24 months in intervention households consuming a sufficient diversity of foods (RDD 0.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.04) was higher than in control households; however, there was a non‐significant increase in the percentage of pregnant and lactating women receiving an adequate diversity of foods in their diets (RDD 0.86, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.05) among intervention compared with control households at endline. CONCLUSION: Our integrated WASH and nutrition intervention resulted in important changes in behaviours. This theory‐informed intervention could be added to existing care group programmes to considerable advantage.",5,11,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 33234528,,,,,Journal article,Child; Female; Humans; Hygiene; Kenya [epidemiology]; Lactation; Pregnancy; Sanitation; Water,10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002806,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02289019/full,
CN-02668473,"Giddaluru, GR; Sreedhara, CG; Kishan, A",PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF TWO ANTISEPTIC SOLUTIONS FOR PREVENTION OF CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETER COLONIZATION AND INFECTION IN END STAGE RENAL DISEASE PATIENTS,Indian journal of nephrology,2023,"BACKGROUND: CVCs are essential components in the care of many patients including those who are chronically or critically ill and those requiring hemodialysis.1 According to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) a CVC or central line (CL) is oean intravascular catheter that terminates at or close to the heart or in one of the great vessels which is used for infusion withdrawal of blood or hemodynamic monitoring. (2) In the United States more than 150 million CVCs are sold each year (3) and they can be classified into short‐term (ST) versus long‐term (LT) catheters depending upon the anticipated duration of catheterization. Although mostly encountered in intensive care units (ICUs) CVCs are increasingly used in non‐ICU wards (4) and outpatient settings. Owing to the invasive procedure necessary for placing a CVC and the break in the integument complications such as exit‐site infections and bloodstream infections (BSIs) can develop. Pathogens either migrate along the outer surface of the catheter into deeper tissue and the bloodstream or less commonly they are introduced into the catheter hub and proceed along the lumen. CVC associated BSIs or central line‐associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are among the most frequent health care associated infections. The infection risk varies with a number of factors including type of device (5) the insertion site (6) and the adherence to preventive measures (7). Incidence rates of catheter infections are usually presented as number of infections per 1000 catheter days. The manual collection of data for this denominator is relatively time‐consuming; therefore electronic algorithms have been studied with the goal of facilitating surveillance (8). Reported rates range from <1 BSI/1000 catheter 'days (9) to 10 or more (10). The microbial spectrum includes a variety of Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacteria as well as yeasts with the predominant organisms being Staphylococcus aureus coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS) and Candida species (spp.). In India two factors contribute to the possibility of higher infection rates in intravenous catheters. Firstly air pollution and secondly the lack of adequate sanitation. Air pollution is a major and growing risk factor for ill health in general in India contributing significantly to the country burden of disease. As per the Global Burden of Disease comparative risk assessment for 2015 air pollution exposure contributes to approximately 1.8 million pr. AIMS OF THE STUDY: 1. To describe SQ53 a novel patented biocidal antimicrobial solution with focus on bacterial attachment and biofilm formation). 2. To compare the efficacy SQ53 is an antimicrobial sporicidal aqueous formulation that is based on a platform of quaternary ammonium chloride compounds (quats).(Other active components include polymeric biguanide chlorocresol bronopol and ethanol) with 10% povidone iodine on the prevention of central venous or arterial catheter colonization and infection. METHODS: From October 2020 to October 2021 220 patients requiring CVC were recruied and divided into 2 groups. 1st Group recied SQ53 solution as antiseptic. 2nd group recieved 10% povidine idoine. What is SQ53? A novel patented biocidal antimicrobial solution that can be made in different forms e.g. as a concentrate or impregnated into wipes. It has been tested against a wide range of bacteria viruses spores and fungal pathogens. Extensive laboratory testing has demonstrated the effectiveness of SQ53 impregnated wipes in cleaning surfaces including catheters over a 24 hour plus time period. In addition it includes no development of VNBC populations or evidence of resistance to the active compounds. SQ53 contains Benzalkonium chloride solution (ADBAC) Didecyl dimethylammoniumchloride (DDAC Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) Bronopol p‐Chloro‐m‐creosol Ethanol (denatured) Monoethylene glycol (MEG) Propan‐2‐ol Methanol Ethanol Aqua SQ53 is available is a sterilised pack with a single wipe inside. The pack is easy to open by tearing off the top end and presenting the contents to the operator to remove under sterile conditions. Definition of compassionate grounds: Patients were deemed suitable to be included in the study on compassionate grounds if they needed long term CVC and had had 2‐line infections or more in the span of 60 days that required hospital admission and change of the line. Such patients were included on a named patient basis and appropriate consent was obtained from them for the use of the SQ53 impregnated wipes as an adjunct for line care. Definition of high‐risk for line infection: These patients were at higher risk for line infections because of the following; a. Older age group (more than 70 years old) b. Prior Episodes pf CRBSI Technique of using SQ53 and 10% povidone iodine in Group 1 and Group 2 SQ53 and 10% povidone iodine was used in the respective groups at two time lines: a. As an adjunct to cleaning the site of puncture during the insertion of a CVC as well as b. Cleaning of the site the catheter and hubs every third day. The site of insertion was prepped under sterile conditions and solution used in the CVC package. After isolation of the site a second wipe down with SQ53 was done at the proposed point of puncture. A radius of 10 cm. from the site of puncture was wiped down with the sterile SQ53 wipe. CONCLUSION: Sq53 solution was more effective than 10% povidone iodine for insertion site care of short‐term central venous and arterial catheters. This effect appeared related to a more efficacious prevention of infections with Gram‐positive bacteria. The use of SQ53, a novel, patented biocide antimicrobial solution as an adjunct to standard insertion and cleaning regimens for intermediate and long‐term catheters in India, significantly dropped the CLABSIs per 365 catheter days from a mean of 48 to 3, making the use of external lines a real possibility in the healthcare sector in the country. CLABSIs are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. The 2 predominating sources of infection are believed to be extraluminal (from the skin during and following insertion) and intraluminal (from contaminated infusates or contaminated catheter hubs). (13) Recommendations regarding the use of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) for skin preparation prior to insertion and in dressings/ sponges placed at the insertion site or as part of the dressing have largely successfully addressed the extraluminal source. (14) The extra luminal source is the main port of entry of infections in India due to the higher bioburden in the environment as well as the lack of understanding about the precautions to be adhered to during line handling.",33,,S1‐S2,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 643425346,,,,Journal article; Conference proceeding,*central vein; *central venous catheter; *end stage renal disease; *infection; Adverse device effect; Air pollution; Algorithm; Antimicrobial activity; Artery catheter; Bacterial spore; Biofilm; Bloodstream infection; Catheter infection; Catheter related bloodstream infection; Catheterization; Catheter‐related bacteremia; Central nervous system; Coagulase negative Staphylococcus; Conference abstract; Critically ill patient; Cross infection; Disease burden; Global disease burden; Health care cost; Healthcare associated infection; Hemodynamic monitoring; Hospital admission; Human; Infection risk; Intensive care unit; Intravascular catheter; Intravenous catheter; Invasive procedure; Laboratory test; Polymerization; Prevention; Risk assessment; Risk factor; Sanitation; Staphylococcus aureus; Yeast,10.4103/0971-4065.391076,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02668473/full,

The use of azithromycin (AZM) reduces the rate of acute respiratory exacerbations in this population, however, impact of this treatment on the gut microbiota and associations with blood‐derived inflammatory markers have not been studied. Methods: Children and adolescents with HCLD in Harare, Zimbabwe and Blantyre, Malawi were recruited in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial of once‐weekly AZM or placebo for 48 weeks (BREATHE trial, NCT02426112). Rectal swabs were collected at inclusion (N = 346), 48 weeks (treatment end, N = 313), and 72 weeks (six months after treatment cessation, N = 244). The bacterial composition of fecal swabs was determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Plasma biomarkers at inclusion and 48 weeks were measured using Luminex multiplex bead assay. Findings: At 48 weeks, bacterial α‐diversity was significantly lower in the AZM group, with 27 bacterial genera showing differential abundance between the study groups. The placebo group exhibited higher interconnectivity between bacterial genera at 48 weeks compared to the AZM group. Correlations between the top seven differentially abundant genera and biomarkers observed at inclusion were no longer significant at 48 weeks in both groups. Depletion of Campylobacter persisted for six months after cessation of AZM treatment. Interpretation: Long‐term AZM treatment in HCLD patients affects their gut bacterial composition at least 6 months after its cessation. The consequences of reduced bacterial diversity, such as altered interaction with the immune system and risk of resistance, need further investigation to understand how to optimise gut health during long‐term antibiotic treatments.

Objective: To determine the efficacy of VE303, a defined bacterial consortium of 8 strains of commensal Clostridia, in adults at high risk for CDI recurrence. The primary objective was to determine the recommended VE303 dosing for a phase 3 trial. Design, Setting, and Participants: Phase 2, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, dose‐ranging study conducted from February 2019 to September 2021 at 27 sites in the US and Canada. The study included 79 participants aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with laboratory‐confirmed CDI with 1 or more prior CDI episodes in the last 6 months and those with primary CDI at high risk for recurrence (defined as aged ≥75 years or ≥65 years with ≥1 risk factors: creatinine clearance <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, proton pump inhibitor use, remote [>6 months earlier] CDI history). Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to high‐dose VE303 (8.0 × 109 colony‐forming units [CFUs]) (n = 30), low‐dose VE303 (1.6 × 109 CFUs) (n = 27), or placebo capsules (n = 22) orally once daily for 14 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of participants with CDI recurrence at 8 weeks using a combined clinical and laboratory definition. The primary efficacy end point was analyzed in 3 prespecified analyses, using successively broader definitions for an on‐study CDI recurrence: (1) diarrhea consistent with CDI plus a toxin‐positive stool sample; (2) diarrhea consistent with CDI plus a toxin‐positive, polymerase chain reaction‐positive, or toxigenic culture‐positive stool sample; and (3) diarrhea consistent with CDI plus laboratory confirmation or (in the absence of a stool sample) treatment with a CDI‐targeted antibiotic. Results: Baseline characteristics were similar across the high‐dose VE303 (n = 29; 1 additional participant excluded from efficacy analysis), low‐dose VE303 (n = 27), and placebo (n = 22) groups. The participants' median age was 63.5 years (range, 24‐96); 70.5% were female; and 1.3% were Asian, 1.3% Black, 2.6% Hispanic, and 96.2% White. CDI recurrence rates through week 8 (using the efficacy analysis 3 definition) were 13.8% (4/29) for high‐dose VE303, 37.0% (10/27) for low‐dose VE303, and 45.5% (10/22) for placebo (P = .006, high‐dose VE303 vs placebo). Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults with laboratory‐confirmed CDI with 1 or more prior CDI episodes in the last 6 months and those with primary CDI at high risk for recurrence, high‐dose VE303 prevented recurrent CDI compared with placebo. A larger, phase 3 study is needed to confirm these findings.

Aim: We performed a randomised trial to assess the efficacy of FMT in patients with IBS. Methods: We randomised 56 patients with diarrhoea‐predominant IBS 1:1 to FMT or placebo via the duodenal route at baseline and week 4. The primary outcome was > 50 points decrease in IBS severity scoring system (IBS‐SSS) score at week 12. Secondary outcomes were improvement in bloating and change in gut microbiota at week 12. After 12‐week follow‐up, those in the placebo group were assigned to receive open‐label FMT. Results: At week 12, 57.1% in the FMT group and 46.4% in the placebo group achieved the primary endpoint (p = 0.42). More patients receiving FMT than placebo had improvement in bloating (72% vs 30%; p = 0.005).

The G‐Power program was used to determine the sample of the study and it was planned to recruit 60 women in total (acupressure group: 30 women, control group: 30 women). The data of the research will be collected with the Postpartum Information Form created by the researcher. Which group the participants will be in will be determined by the full randomization technique on the website www.randomizer.org. After obtaining the permission of the ethics committee and the institution to carry out the study, the women who had a cesarean section will be met by going to the institution. Mothers who meet the research criteria will be informed about the purpose, content and methods of the research, and verbal and written consent will be obtained from those who want to participate. The researcher will fill in the ""Postpartum Information Form"" by interviewing the pregnant women face‐to‐face before the cesarean section, examining their socio‐demographic and obstetric characteristics, and the operation information from the patient's file after the cesarean section. Postpartum Information Form: This form was developed by researchers based on the literature. It consists of questions that include socio‐domographic and obstetric characteristics and surgical information. Within the scope of the research, 7 questions including socio‐demographic characteristics of pregnant women (age, education level, occupation, amount of fluid intake, economic status, bowel habits before and during pregnancy), 8 questions including obstetrical characteristics (gestational week, number of pregnancies, number of abortions, miscarriage) number of children, number of living children, number of live births, previous type of delivery, reason for cesarean section), 7 questions including surgery information (time of start and end of surgery, fasting time before surgery, total amount of fluid given during surgery, amount of blood lost during surgery, admission to the ward). date and time, bowel function status of women after surgery) consists of a total of 22 questions. Pre‐Application In order to assess whether the questions have been understood, a preliminary study will be conducted with five mothers before starting the study. As a result of the evaluation, it will be evaluated whether there is a need for editing in the data forms and adjustments will be made. Those included in the preliminary study will not be included in the sample group. Data Collection After acupressure, the woman will be ready to serve. The control process will be any application. A suitable environment will be prepared for mothers in terms of warmth and light, where privacy can be protected. The application points will be determined with the acu‐point device by choosing the most comfortable position for the mother, leaving the application points open. The most preferred points on intestinal functions were LI4 and TH6 points. LI4 (Hegu) and TH6 pressure points will be applied consecutively. Depending on the preparation and compression time on the 2 selected points (4 points with each point on the other extremity), the session duration of an individual will be approximately 12 minutes. While practicing, the researcher will check the time using a digital wristwatch with a stopwatch. LI4: It is the point where the cambered muscle group is when the thumb and forefinger are brought closer together. In other words, it corresponds to the midpoint of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. This area is often preferred for problems such as face, head, toothache, stomachache, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dysentery, dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, difficult or abnormal birth. TH 6: Located on the outer side of the arm, 4 fingers above the wrist crease, on the midline of the arm (between radius and ulna bones). This point is used in the treatment of constipation, irritable colon disease, hoarseness. First, after 2 minutes of pressure is applied to the LI4 compression point on both hands, the TH 6 compression point on both arms will be applied consecutively without interruption. Although there is a difference in the order of use of the determined acupressure points, in this study, first LI4 and then TH 6 points will be performed. While practicing, the researcher will control the time using a digital wrist watch with a stopwatch. The practitioner has acupressure training on this subject. Analysis of Data The data of the study will be evaluated using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 22.0 program. All data will first be evaluated with Kolmogorov‐Smirnov for conformity to normal distribution and then analyzed according to fitness for normal distribution. For descriptive statistics, percentages will be used in general, arithmetic mean±standard deviation for those suitable for normal distribution, median and minimum‐maximum values for those that do not fit. In the analysis of the data, student t test and ANOVA test will be used for those with normal distribution, and Mann‐Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis tests for those who do not.

Ukraine,2024,"Acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) are an urgent problem in young children, which is due to their significant prevalence, they have a constant tendency to increase and occupy the first places in the structure of infectious diseases. Damage to the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract in children with ARVI lead to numerous problems that require adequate replacement of the main functions of the child’s body, which determined the relevance of our study. Purpose — to analyze the effectiveness of the use of isotonic dilution of sea water (Pshyk Mini medicine) for irrigation therapy in nasal congestion in infants and young children caused by acute respiratory infections. Materials and methods. A comprehensive examination of 100 infants and young children with influenza and other ARVI was conducted in the infectious diseases department of the Chernivtsi Regional Children’s Clinical Hospital. The children were randomly divided into 2 clinical groups: the Group I included 55 children (average age — 1.09±0.3 years, the proportion of boys — 58.1%), who, as part of complex standard therapy, received nasal irrigation using 2–3 drops of Pshyk mini medicine in each nostril 3 times/day. The Group II included 45 patients (average age — 1.15±0.2 years (p>0.05), the proportion of boys — 59.1% (p>0.05)), in whom isotonic sodium chloride solution was used for the purpose of the nasal sanitation. Results. The conducted studies showed that starting from the 3–4th day of hospitalization, a statistically significant decrease in catarrhal manifestations and the severity of nasal obstruction was noted in patients of the Group I who received Pshyk Mini in complex treatment. In particular, in relation to the results of the Group II, in the children of the Group I, on the 4th day of inpatient treatment, the chances of reducing the severity of catarrhal manifestations (estimated ≤2 points) increased: the absolute risk increase — 53.0%, the relative risk increase — 67.9% (95% CI: 57.8–76.9) with the minimum number of patients who need to be treated to obtain a positive result — 1.5. We also established that compared to the representatives of the Group II, children of the Group I had almost a 4‐fold increase in the chances of restoring tolerance to feeding (estimation of feeding difficulties ≤2 points): attributive risk — 30.5%, relative risk — 1.6 (95% CI: 0.6–4.8), odds ratio — 3.9 (95% CI: 1.2–12.3). Conclusions. For the purpose of unblocking of nasal breathing in infants and children of early age at the background of acute respiratory viral infections, the use of an isotonic solution of sea water (Pshyk Mini medicine) has a number of significant advantages compared to the use of an isotonic solution of sodium chloride for this purpose.

Global cholera control efforts rely heavily on effective water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions in cholera‐endemic settings. Methods. Using data from a large, randomized controlled trial of oral cholera vaccine conducted in Kolkata, India, we evaluated whether natural variations in WASH in an urban slum setting were predictive of cholera risk. From the control population (n = 55 086), baseline WASH data from a randomly selected “training subpopulation” (n = 27 634) were analyzed with recursive partitioning to develop a dichotomous (“better” vs “not better”) composite household WASH variable from several WASH features collected at baseline, and this composite variable was then evaluated in a mutually exclusive “validation population” (n = 27 452). We then evaluated whether residents of better WASH households in the entire population (n = 55 086) experienced lower cholera risk using Cox regression models. Better WASH was defined by a combination of 4 dichotomized WASH characteristics including safe source of water for daily use, safe source of drinking water, private or shared flush toilet use, and always handwashing with soap after defecation. Results. Residence in better WASH households was associated with a 30% reduction in risk of cholera over a 5‐year period (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.70 [95% confidence interval, .49–.99]; P = .048). We also found that the impact of better WASH households on reducing cholera risk was greatest in young children (0–4 years) and this effect progressively declined with age. Conclusions.

The vaccine candidate ETVAX encompasses several ETEC colonization factors (CFs) with a hybrid LT (heat‐labile toxin)/cholera toxin B subunit adjuvanted with a double‐mutant LT. Stool samples from a Phase 2b ETVAX trial were tested by a PCR‐based customized TaqMan Array Card (TAC), including three ETEC toxin genes (LT and heat‐stable toxins, STh and STp) and 18 ETEC CFs. Stool samples were also tested with the molecular platform Amplidiag and culture, followed by GM1‐enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and inhibition GM1‐ELISA for LT and ST and dot blot for CFs of ETECs identified among six culture isolates (maximum). Compared with Amplidiag, TAC yielded 89.4% sensitivity (320/358) and 96.4% specificity (405/420) for ETEC detection. The two methods demonstrated a good quantitative correlation (quantification cycle R2 = 0.827, P < 0.05). Compared with culture, TAC and Amplidiag each exhibited 96.8% (184/190) sensitivity and identified an additional of 151 and 174 PCR positives in 588 culture‐negative stools, respectively. The concordance of stool TAC versus ELISA of ETEC colonies for LT and STh/STp was 85.5% (165/193). TAC demonstrated 98% sensitivity and 92% specificity versus the dot blot results of 793 colonies for the ETVAX CFs CFA/I, CS3, CS5, and CS6. Overall ETEC was detected by TAC in 335 (43.1%) and by Amplidiag in 358 (46.0%) of specimens compared to 190 (24.4%) by culture. We conclude that molecular diagnostic approaches of TAC or Amplidiag increase the detection of ETEC compared with culture, and TAC can also provide vaccine‐subtype ETEC data.CLINICAL TRIALSThis study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03729219.IMPORTANCEEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an important cause of childhood and travelers' diarrhea. Vaccines in development utilize specific toxins and colonization factors (CFs) as antigens. Therefore, clinical microbiologic diagnostic methods are needed to discriminate specific toxins and CFs, both for vaccine trials and to guide epidemiology. In this work, we assessed the diagnostic performance of several methods for ETEC: a PCR‐based customized TaqMan Array Card (TAC) and the molecular platform Amplidiag on stool and E. coli culture, followed by GM1‐enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay for toxins and dot blot for CFs. Stool samples from a Phase 2b ETEC vaccine trial were used. Overall, ETEC was detected by TAC in 335 (43.1%) and by Amplidiag in 358 samples (46.0%) compared to 190 (24.4%) by culture. TAC additionally provided CF data with 98% sensitivity and 92% specificity.

Previous studies suggest that stunted children have elevated inflammatory biomarkers, but no studies have characterised their capacity to respond to new infections (i.e., their immune function). We hypothesised that antibacterial immune function would differ between stunted and non‐stunted children and relate to their health and environment during early life. Methods: We enrolled a cross‐sectional cohort of 113 HIV‐negative children nested within a longitudinal cluster‐randomised controlled trial of household‐level infant and young child feeding (IYCF) and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions in rural Zimbabwe (SHINE; Clinical trials registration: NCT01824940). Venous blood was collected at 18 months of age and cultured for 24 h without antigen or with bacterial antigens: heat‐killed Salmonella typhimurium (HKST) or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TNFα, IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐12p70, hepcidin, soluble (s)CD163, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and IFNβ were quantified in culture supernatants by ELISA to determine antigen‐specific immune function. The effect of stunting status and early‐life exposures (anthropometry, inflammation at 18 months, maternal health during pregnancy, household WASH) on immune function was tested in logit and censored log‐normal (tobit) regression models. Results: Children who were stunted (n = 44) had higher proportions (86.4% vs. 65.2%; 88.6% vs. 73.4%) and concentrations of LPS‐specific IL‐6 (geometric mean difference (95% CI): 3.46 pg/mL (1.09, 10.80), p = 0.035) and IL‐8 (3.52 pg/mL (1.20, 10.38), p = 0.022) than non‐stunted children (n = 69). Bacterial antigen‐specific pro‐inflammatory cytokine concentrations were associated with biomarkers of child enteropathy at 18 months and biomarkers of systemic inflammation and enteropathy in their mothers during pregnancy. Children exposed to the WASH intervention (n = 33) produced higher LPS‐ (GMD (95% CI): 10.48 pg/mL (1.84, 60.31), p = 0.008) and HKST‐specific MPO (5.10 pg/mL (1.77, 14.88), p = 0.003) than children in the no WASH group (n = 80). There was no difference in antigen‐specific immune function between the IYCF (n = 55) and no IYCF groups (n = 58). Conclusions: Antibacterial immune function among 18‐month‐old children in a low‐income setting was shaped by their stunting status and prior exposure to maternal inflammation and household WASH.

Here, we analyzed the microbiome of Trichuris trichiura and hookworm‐infected patients and found an association of different enterotypes with treatment efficacy. 80 T. trichiura‐infected patients with hookworm co‐infections from Pak‐Khan, Laos, received either albendazole (n = 41) or albendazole and ivermectin combination therapy (n = 39). Pre‐/post‐treatment stool samples were collected to monitor treatment efficacy and microbial communities were profiled using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, qPCR, and shotgun sequencing. We identified three bacterial enterotypes and show that pre‐treatment enterotype is associated with efficacy of the combination treatment for both T. trichiura (CRET1 = 5.8%; CRET2 = 16.6%; CRET3 = 68.8%) and hookworm (CRET1 = 31.3%; CRET2 = 16.6%; CRET3 = 78.6%).

However, to date, there are insufficient data to confirm or rule out this association, or even to provide basic information about these viruses, such as how they are distributed in the population, the persistence sites and their pathogenesis. In this study, we analysed stool specimens from Brazilian children with and without acute diarrhoea to investigate the excretion of HPyV10 and HPyV11 as well as their possible associations with diarrhoea. A total of 460 stool specimens were obtained from children with acute diarrhoea of unknown aetiology, and 106 stool specimens were obtained from healthy asymptomatic children under 10 years old. Samples were collected during the periods of 1999‐2006, 2010‐2012 and 2016‐2017, and found previously to be negative for other enteric viruses and bacteria. The specimens were screened for HPyV10 and HPyV11 DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Randomly selected positive samples were sequenced to confirm the presence of HPyV10 and HPyV11. The sequenced strains showed a percent of nucleotide identity of 93.4‐99.6% and 85.5‐98.9% with the reference HPyV10 and HPyV11 strains, respectively, confirming the PCR results. HPyV10 and HPyV11 were detected in 7.2% and 4.7% of the stool specimens from children with and without diarrhoea, respectively. The prevalence of both viruses was the same among children with diarrhoea and healthy children. There was also no difference between boys and girls or the degree of disease (severe, moderate or mild) among groups.

A clear understanding of the seroepidemiology and correlates of protection for invasive NTS (iNTS) in relation to key risk factors (malaria, anaemia, malnutrition) in children in Africa is needed to inform strategies for disease control including vaccine implementation. METHODOLOGY: The SAiNTS study is a prospective community cohort study with paired serology samples from 2500 Malawian children 0‐5 years at baseline and three months to measure age‐stratified acquisition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O‐antigen antibody (IgG) and serum bactericidal activity to the main serovars causing iNTS ( Salmonella Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis). Children are selected from mapped and censused randomly selected households in Chikwawa, Malawi; an area with substantial malaria burden. The sampling framework is set within a malaria vaccination (RTS,S/ AS01) phase 4 cluster randomized trial, known as the Epidemiology Study of Malaria Transmission Intensity (EPI‐MAL), allowing exploration of the impact of malaria vaccination on acquisition of immunity to NTS. Risk factor data for invasive disease will be collected using rapid diagnostic tests for malaria and anaemia, anthropometry for malnutrition, and a validated questionnaire for indicators of socioeconomic status, water and sanitation. All data will be recorded through electronic case report forms using the REDCap and the Open Data Kit (ODK) platforms. Stool sample analysis includes NTS culture and pan‐Salmonella polymerase chain reaction to assess enteric exposure and biomarkers of environmental enteric dysfunction. Cases with iNTS disease will be followed up for comparison with community controls. CONCLUSIONS: The final cohort of 2500 children will allow investigation into the impact of risk factors for iNTS on the acquisition of immunity in children 0‐5 years in an endemic setting, including comparisons to partner seroepidemiology studies in three other sub‐Saharan African sites (1000 children per site).

These symptoms: reflux, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea and indigestion. After surgery, slowing of gastrointestinal system motility and change in eating habits can cause serious problems in patients by causing the development of gastrointestinal symptoms such as post‐operative nausea, vomiting and hiccups. The development of these symptoms, on the other hand, prolongs the hospital discharge time of patients and may lead to increased costs. Prolonged persistence of abdominal distension after surgery; It may cause delayed wound healing due to increased pressure in the incision area, deep vein thrombosis in the legs due to decreased venous return, paralytic ileus and gastric dilation due to decreased blood flow in the intestine.Constipation; It can cause pain, nausea, vomiting, distention, feeding intolerance and contribute to the development of intestinal obstruction or perforation if not treated. There are many care and treatment methods, including pharmacological and non‐pharmacological, stimulating gastrointestinal motility after surgical intervention. Abdominal massage, which is one of the non‐pharmacological methods, is an important intervention in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms. Abdominal massage is a noninvasive application that stimulates bowel movements by applying patting, kneading and vibration movements over the abdominal wall to the area where the intestines are located. It increases peristalsis, creates a mechanical and reflex effect on the intestines, reducing the individual's feeling of pain and discomfort. The aim in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms is to prevent problems that may develop and to increase the quality of life and comfort of the patient by reducing these problems when they occur. Nurses are one of the team members who can diagnose and communicate with all aspects of healthy/sick individuals and their families, and take an active role in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms that may develop after surgical intervention and in the care of the individual. In this context, nurses have important roles and responsibilities. When the literature is examined, it has been observed that patients experience various problems related to gastrointestinal symptoms after surgical intervention. Abdominal massage, which is one of the non‐pharmacological methods, is one of the most important independent nursing interventions in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms, as it is low cost and effective, without side effects for healthy/sick individuals and their families. In this context, this study planned to determine the effect of abdominal massage applied to patients after surgical intervention on gastrointestinal symptoms and comfort level. In this research aimed to examine the effect of abdominal massage applied after surgical ıntervention on gastrointestinal symptoms and comfort level. The type of this study designed as randomized controlled experimental. The research hypotheses are as follows; H1: Abdominal massage applied after surgery reduces the gastrointestinal symptoms of patients. H2: Abdominal massage applied after surgery increases the comfort level of patients. The independent variables of the study the application of abdominal massage, the individual and disease characteristics of the patients; dependent variables are gastrointestinal symptom and comfort level scores. The research will be carried out in the Orthopedics and Traumatology Clinic of Istanbul Medical Faculty Hospital in Istanbul between January 2023 and July 2024. The population of the research will consist patients who were hospitalized and underwent surgical intervention between January 2023 and July 2024 in the Orthopedics and Traumatology Clinic of the Istanbul Medical Faculty Hospital in Istanbul.The sample of the research will consist patients who cannot defecate for 3 days after surgery and who meet other sample selection criteria. Data will be collected through the Patient Information Form, Bristol Stool Scale, Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, General Comfort Scale, and Functional Independence Scale. The patient information form was prepared by the researchers in line with the literature. Permission was obtained from the scale owners for the scales to be used in the study. Patient Information Form: It was created by the researcher based on the literature. It consists of two parts, individual and disease characteristics of the patients. In the first part; In the second part, individual characteristics such as age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), marital status, education level, health insurance, income level, history of surgical intervention, type of surgery and anesthesia applied, toilet habits, gastrointestinal problems, diet, nutrition habits and exercise status, first gas and stool removal time, initiation of oral intake and mobilization status. In the last part of the form, there is a table in which the bowel sounds measured during the patient follow‐up will be recorded. Bristol Stool Scale: The Bristol stool scale will be used to evaluate the individual's first stool. Forms of feces found on the scale; Type 1 ‐ Goat dung‐like, lumpy and chunky hard stool Type 2 ‐ Larger and combined agglomeration Type 3 ‐ Less thick, softer stool with shallow cracks on the surface Type 4 ‐ Stool with a smooth, slippery surface and a soft consistency Type 5 ‐ Pieces of excrement with a consistency to give an edge Type 6 ‐ Soft viscous, more water content, piecemeal stool Type 7 ‐ Hard or soft, watery stool with no solid stool content Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale: It was developed by Revicki et al in 1998 to evaluate common symptoms of gastrointestinal diseases, clinical experience, and views on gastrointestinal symptoms. The scale includes 15 items, each scored on a seven‐point Likert‐type scale, with values ranging from ""no discomfort"" to ""very severe discomfort"". 15 items based on factor analysis; It is divided into five subscales as abdominal pain, reflux, diarrhea, indigestion and constipation. How the individual feels in terms of gastrointestinal problems in the last week is questioned. Higher scores on the scale indicate more severe symptoms. He states that the Cronbach α value in the original scale was between 0.61 and 0.83. In the Turkish adaptation of the scale, the Cronbach Alpha value for all items was found to be 0.82. General Comfort Scale: It was developed by Kolcaba in 1992 to determine comfort needs and to evaluate the situation of achieving the expected increase in comfort with nursing interventions that provide comfort. The Turkish validity and reliability study of the scale was performed by Kuğuoğlu and Karabacak in 2008. The scale is of a four‐point Likert type and contains a total of 48 items. It consists of 3 levels and 4 dimensions. Scale sub‐dimensions; relief (16 items), relaxation (17 items) and overcoming problems (15 items). In addition, it is related to physical comfort (12 items), psycho‐spiritual comfort (13 items), environmental comfort (13 items) and socio‐cultural comfort (10 items). The lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 48, the median score is 120, and the highest score is 192. As the score obtained from the scale increases, the level of comfort perceived by the patient increases. The original Cronbach Alpha value of the scale was 0.88. In the Turkish adaptation of the scale, the Cronbach Alpha value was found to be 0.83 for all items. Functional Independence Scale: It is an assessment tool used to evaluate the functional status of individuals. It is divided into two areas: motor and cognitive. It consists of a total of 18 items, 13 in the motor domain and 5 in the cognitive domain. 6 categories and a total of 18 activities are evaluated: self‐care (42 points), sphincter control (14 points), transfer (21 points), movement (14 points), communication (14 points) and social perception (21 points). Scale scores range from 18 to 126. A seven point scale is used for each activity. FIM is divided into two measures. Motor FIM consists of 13 functional activities and cognitive FIM consists of 5 cognitive activities. If the total FIM score is 36 points or less, it is defined as high, between 37‐72 points as moderate, and 73 points and above as low disability. Application of Research Patients who meet the sample selection criteria for the study will be informed about the purpose, content and method of the study. This scope of work; Patients who do not defecate in the first 3 days after the surgical intervention will form the experimental and control groups and will be followed by the researcher for 3 days. Experimental and control groups will be determined randomly in patients undergoing surgery who meet the sample selection criteria for the study. Experimental group ‐ At the first encounter with the patient; Patient Information Form, Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, General Comfort Scale and Functional Independence Scale will be applied. ‐ From the morning of the first day, abdominal massage will be applied to the patients 2 times a day, in the morning and in the evening, for 3 days. Each abdominal massage will be applied for 15 minutes. ‐ While applying abdominal massage to the patients in the experimental group, the abdominal massage application guidelines (Uysal, Eşer and Akpınar, 2012) in the literature will be used. After each massage application, the patient's bowel sounds/movements will be listened to. ‐ Medicines such as laxatives, suppositories and enemas will not be given to the experimental group and Bristol Stool Scale will be filled in for patients who defecate within this period. ‐ In order to evaluate the abdominal massage and its effect on the comfort level of the patients, the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, General Comfort Scale and Functional Independence Scale will be applied again at the end of the 3rd day after the application of abdominal massage. Abdominal Massage Application Guideline: 1. Hands are washed. 2. The healthy/sick individual and their relatives are informed about the procedure. 3. Pain, tenderness, tightness, redness, deterioration of skin integrity and empty bladder are evaluated in the abdominal region of a healthy/sick individual. 4. The healthy/sick individual is placed in the supine position or if there is a risky situation, the bedside of the healthy/sick individual can be 30‐45 degrees above. 5. The abdominal region is opened by paying attention to the privacy of the healthy/sick individual. If the skin is damp, it is dried with a towel. 6. A small amount of liquid Vaseline is poured into the hands, and the hands are rubbed to warm the hands and spread the lotion. 7. Superficial effusion is performed by applying light pressure on the abdomen of the healthy/sick individual, starting from the upper epigastric region and downwards, over the iliac bones, from both sides of the pelvis towards the groin. With this effusion, reactive abdominal wall tension due to the first touch is prevented. 8. After the abdominal wall of the healthy/sick individual is relaxed; ‐ All movements will be clockwise, ‐ Considering the anatomical area starting from the right anterior superior iliac crest, from the level of the ribs to the left anterior superior iliac crest, ‐ First of all, massage is applied to the right lower quadrant and right upper quadrant where the ascending colon is located, from the level of the ribs to the left upper quadrant for the transverse colon, and to the left upper and left lower quadrants for the descending colon. ‐ The massage applied to each quadrant lasts at least 1 minute and moderate pressure is applied. 9. After the efflorescence movement, the same order is followed and the petrissage movement is performed with the palm. 10. Effeurage and petrissage movements are applied one after the other for 15 minutes, respectively. 11. Finally, vibration is applied using only fingertips for 1 minute and the process is terminated with effusion. 12. The healthy/sick individual is covered and given a comfortable position. Control Group ‐ Patients who did not defecate within the first 3 days after surgery will constitute the control group. ‐ At the first encounter with the patient; A Patient Information Form, Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSS), General Comfort Scale (GAS) and Functional Independence Scale (FIM) will be administered. ‐ From the first encounter, patients will be given medications that are in line with their clinical routine, such as laxatives, suppositories and enemas, according to the doctor's request. ‐ Intestinal sounds/movements of the patients will be listened to 6 times, 2 times a day for 3 days. ‐ Bristol Stool Scale will be filled in for patients who defecate within this period. ‐ At the end of the 3‐day follow‐up of the patients, Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, General Comfort Scale and Functional Independence Scale will be applied again and the first stool of the patients who defecate will be evaluated with the Bristol Stool Scale. Statistical analysis of research data will be done using a package program called SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics 24).

Thirty‐two pregnant women were randomly assigned to two groups. The probiotic group (PG) consisted of pregnant women who consumed triple viable Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus tablets from the 32nd week of pregnancy until delivery. The functional profiles of the gut microbiota were predicted through high‐throughput 16S rRNA sequencing results using PICRUSt software and referencing the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. In the gut microbiota of the PG, the genera Blautia and Ruminococcus, as well as the species Subdoligranulum, showed significantly higher relative abundances compared to the control group (CG) (P < 0.05). At Level 1 of the KEGG signaling pathways, there was a significant reduction in the functional genes of the gut microbiota involved in Organismal Systems in the PG (P < 0.05). In Level 2 of the KEGG signaling pathways, there was a significant reduction in the functional genes of the gut microbiota involved in Infectious Disease in the PG (P < 0.05). In Level 3 of the KEGG signaling pathways, the PG exhibited a significant increase in the functional genes of the gut microbiota involved in ABC transporters, Oxidative phosphorylation, Folate biosynthesis, and Biotin metabolism (P < 0.05). The CG showed a significant increase in the functional genes related to Cysteine and methionine metabolism, Vitamin B6 metabolism, Tuberculosis, and Vibrio cholerae pathogenic cycle (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our findings suggest that probiotic supplementation during pregnancy has a significant impact on functional metabolism in healthy pregnant women. IMPORTANCE: Probiotics are considered beneficial to human health. There is limited understanding of how probiotic consumption during pregnancy affects the functional diversity of the gut microbiota. The aim of our study is to investigate the impact of probiotic consumption during pregnancy on the functional diversity of the gut microbiota. Our findings suggest that probiotic supplementation during pregnancy has a significant impact on functional metabolism. This could potentially open up new avenues for preventing various pregnancy‐related complications. This also provides new insights into the effects of probiotic consumption during pregnancy on the gut microbiota and offers a convenient method for exploring the potential mechanisms underlying the impact of probiotics on the gut microbiota of pregnant women.",12,6,e0041324,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 38687069,EMBASE 644139467,,,,Journal article,"*Gastrointestinal Microbiome [drug effects]; *Probiotics [administration & dosage]; *RNA, Ribosomal, 16S [genetics]; *functional diversity; *intestine flora; *metagenome; *prediction; *pregnancy; *pregnant woman; Adult; Article; Bacteria [classification, drug effects, genetics, isolation & purification, metabolism]; Bifidobacterium longum; Biosynthesis; Blautia; Controlled study; Drug combination; Feces [microbiology]; Female; Human; Humans; Lactobacillus delbrueckii [genetics]; Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus; Nonhuman; Oxidative phosphorylation; Pregnancy; Ruminococcus; Signal transduction; Streptococcus thermophilus; Streptococcus thermophilus [genetics]; Tuberculosis; Vibrio cholerae; Young Adult",10.1128/spectrum.00413-24,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02697947/full,Complementary Medicine

Although the detrimental impact of these compounds on the intestinal microbiota and intestinal health have been demonstrated in animal and in vitro models, impact of these food additives in healthy humans remains poorly characterized. METHODS: To examine this notion in humans, we performed a double‐blind controlled‐feeding study of the ubiquitous synthetic emulsifier carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) in which healthy adults consumed only emulsifier‐free diets (n = 9) or an identical diet enriched with 15 g per day of CMC (n = 7) for 11 days. RESULTS: Relative to control subjects, CMC consumption modestly increased postprandial abdominal discomfort and perturbed gut microbiota composition in a way that reduced its diversity. Moreover, CMC‐fed subjects exhibited changes in the fecal metabolome, particularly reductions in short‐chain fatty acids and free amino acids. Furthermore, we identified 2 subjects consuming CMC who exhibited increased microbiota encroachment into the normally sterile inner mucus layer, a central feature of gut inflammation, as well as stark alterations in microbiota composition. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the notion that the broad use of CMC in processed foods may be contributing to increased prevalence of an array of chronic inflammatory diseases by altering the gut microbiome and metabolome (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03440229).",162,3,743‐756,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 34774538,EMBASE 636742350,,,,Journal article,*diet; *feeding; *intestine flora; *metabolome; Abdominal discomfort; Adult; Adverse drug reaction; Animals; Article; Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium [*adverse effects]; Clinical article; Controlled study; Diet [*adverse effects]; Double blind procedure; Double‐Blind Method; Dysbiosis [etiology]; Emulsifying Agents [*adverse effects]; Feces; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome [*drug effects]; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Inflammatory disease; Male; Metabolome [*drug effects]; Mice; Mucus; Nonhuman; Prevalence; Processed food; Randomized controlled trial; Side effect,10.1053/j.gastro.2021.11.006,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02356203/full,

Field assistants conducted phone surveys in 26 communities in two districts from May 20, 2020 to May 25, 2020. They asked respondents about their access to a toilet, whether they or a family member left their house to defecate in the past week, and whether specific practices had changed since the lockdown. Among 2,044 respondents, 60% had access to a private toilet, 11% to a public or community toilet, whereas 29% lacked access to any toilet facility. In our study, 92% of the respondents did not change their defecation behaviors in the 2 months following the pandemic‐related lockdown. About a third (27%) reported that they or a family member left their house daily to defecate amid lockdown measures.

In our previous study, there was a trend towards a higher α‐diversity of the gut microbiota in sequential feeding (SF) than in continuous feeding (CF) for critically ill patients. We designed this non‐blinded, randomized controlled study to confirm these results. METHODS: All the enrolled patients received continuous feeding in the beginning. After achieving ≥80 % of the nutrition target calories (25‐30 kcal/kg/d), the patients were randomized into the SF group or the CF group. In the SF group, continuous feeding was changed into intermittent feeding. The total daily dosage of enteral nutrition was equally distributed during three periods at 7‐9:00, 11‐13:00 and 17‐19:00. After 7 days of randomization, fresh stool and serum were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis respectively. Meanwhile, routine blood test indicators and metabolic indicators were recorded. RESULTS: Finally, data from 65 patients in the SF group and 69 patients in the CF group were used for intention‐to‐treat analysis. There was no difference in the Shannon index between the SF group and CF group [2.5 (1.7‐3.4) vs. 2.6 (1.5‐3.5), P = 0.934]. However, at the genus level, the abundances of Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG‐003 and Howardella increased in the SF group. Some metabolic indicators (the albumin level, total cholesterol level and total bile acid level) and the increases in lymphocyte counts in the SF group were different from those in the CF group (P < 0.05). In untargeted metabolomic analysis, 58 differentially abundant metabolites between the two groups were found. The pathway with the highest enrichment factors was primary bile acid biosynthesis according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Database classification. Regarding adverse events, the gut tolerance, average glucose and incidence of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia were similar between the SF group and CF group. The mortality rate in the SF group was lower than that in the CF group, but there was no statistical difference (9.2 % vs. 13.0 %, P = 0.484). CONCLUSION: SF did not increase the diversity of gut microbiota in critically ill patients. However, it did alter the abundances of some gut microbes and affect some metabolites. Its clinical significance requires further exploration. In addition, the gut tolerance and safety of SF were similar to that of CF. TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.

Infectious diseases,2021,"BACKGROUND: Killed whole‐cell oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) are widely used for prevention of cholera in developing countries. However, few studies have evaluated the protection conferred by internationally recommended OCVs for durations beyond 2 years of follow‐up. METHODS: In this study, we followed up the participants of a cluster‐randomised controlled trial for 2 years after the end of the original trial. Originally, we had randomised 90 geographical clusters in Dhaka slums in Bangladesh in equal numbers (1:1:1) to a two‐dose regimen of OCV alone (targeted to people aged 1 year or older), a two‐dose regimen of OCV plus a water‐sanitation‐hygiene (WASH) intervention, or no intervention. There was no masking of group assignment. The WASH intervention conferred little additional protection to OCV and was discontinued at 2 years of follow‐up. Surveillance for severe cholera was continued for 4 years. Because of the short duration and effect of the WASH intervention, we combined the two OCV intervention groups. The primary outcomes were OCV overall protection (protection of all members of the intervention clusters) and total protection (protection of individuals who got vaccinated in the intervention clusters) against severe cholera, which we assessed by multivariable survival models appropriate for cluster‐randomised trials. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01339845. FINDINGS: The study was done between April 17, 2011, and Nov 1, 2015. 268 896 participants were present at the time of the first dose, with 188 206 in the intervention group and 80 690 in the control group. OCV coverage of the two groups receiving OCV was 66% (123 659 of 187 214 participants). During 4 years of follow‐up, 441 first episodes of severe cholera were detected (243 episodes in the vaccinated groups and as 198 episodes in the unvaccinated group). Overall OCV protection was 36% (95% CI 19 to 49%) and total OCV protection was 46% (95% CI 32 to 58). Cumulative total vaccine protection was notably lower for people vaccinated before the age of 5 years (24%; ‐30 to 56) than for people vaccinated at age 5 years or older (49%; 35 to 60), although the differences in protection for the two age groups were not significant (p=0·3308). Total vaccine protection dropped notably (p=0·0115) after 3 years in children vaccinated at 1‐4 years of age. INTERPRETATION: These findings provide further evidence of long‐term effectiveness of killed whole‐cell OCV, and therefore further support for the use of killed whole‐cell OCVs to control endemic cholera, but indicate that protection is shorter‐lived in children vaccinated before the age of 5 years than in people vaccinated at the age of 5 years or older.

In common enterocolitis, probiotic organisms, including Lactobacilli, are effective in treating diarrhea. A new species, Lactobacillus plantarum (LRCC5310), which was shown to inhibit the adherence and proliferation of rotavirus in the small intestine through animal experiments, was investigated for the efficacy and safety of patients with rotaviral enteritis. METHODS: LRCC5310 (Group I) and control (Group II) groups consisting of children who were hospitalized for rotaviral enteritis were compared, and the medical records of patients (Group III) who were hospitalized for rotaviral enteritis during the same study period were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical symptoms were compared and stool samples were collected to compare changes in virus multiplication between Groups I and II. RESULTS: Groups I, II, and III comprised 15, 8, and 27 children, respectively. There were no differences in clinical information among the groups at admission. In Group I, a statistically significant improvement was noted in the number of patients with diarrhea, number of defecation events on Day 3, and total diarrhea period as opposed to Group II (P = .033, P = .003, and P = .012, respectively). The improvement of Vesikari score in Group I was greater than that in the other groups (P = .076, P = .061, and P = .036, respectively). Among rotavirus genotypes, 9 (22.5%) strains and 8 (20.0%) strains belonged to the G9P8 and G1P8 genotypes, respectively. The virus reduction effect, as confirmed via stool specimens, was also greater in Group I. No significant side effects were noted in infants.

The aim of our randomized, double‐blind clinical trial was to assess the efficacy of capsule‐delivered fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) versus placebo in reducing recurrent diarrhea and CDI recurrence. The secondary aim was FMT safety assessment. METHODS: Between 2018 and 2022, Veterans across the Veterans Health Administration system with recurrent CDI who responded to antibiotic treatment were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to oral FMT or placebo capsules. Randomization was stratified by number of prior CDI recurrences (1 or ≥2). The primary endpoint was clinical recurrence by day 56, defined as >3 unformed stools daily for ≥2 days with or without laboratory confirmation of C. difficile, or death within 56 days. RESULTS: The study was stopped due to futility after meeting prespecified criteria. Of 153 participants (76 FMT, 77 placebo) with an average age of 66.5 years, 25 participants (32.9%) in the FMT arm and 23 (29.9%) in the placebo arm experienced the primary endpoint of diarrhea and possible or definite CDI recurrence or death within 56 days of capsule administration (absolute difference, 3.0% [95% confidence interval, ‐11.7% to 17.7%]). Stratification by number of recurrences revealed no statistically significant differences. There were no clinically important differences in adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: FMT therapy versus placebo did not reduce CDI recurrence or death at 56 days. There were no meaningful differences in adverse events between treatment groups.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether feeding synbiotic infants and follow‐on formulas during the first year of life reduces the incidence rate (IR) of infectious diarrhea compared with standard formulas. Secondary endpoints included the IR of other infectious diseases as well as fecal milieu parameters. METHODS: In this double‐blind, controlled trial, 460 healthy, 1‐mo‐old infants were randomly assigned to receive a synbiotic [galacto‐oligosaccharides (GOS)/Limosilactobacillus fermentum CECT 5716] (IF, n = 230) or a control formula (CF, n = 230) until 12 mo of age. A reference group of breastfed infants (HM, n = 80) was included. Data on infections were recorded throughout the study period and stool samples were collected at 4 and 12 mo of age. RESULTS: IR of infectious diarrhea during the first year of life was 0.60 (CF), 0.56 (IF), and 0.29 (HM), with no statistically significant difference between groups. The IR of lower respiratory tract infections, 1 of the secondary endpoints, however, was lower in IF than in CF [0.79 compared with 1.01, IR ratio = 0.77 (0.60‐1.00)]. Additionally, fecal pH was significantly lower at 4 mo (P < 0.0001), whereas secretory IgA was significantly higher at 12 mo of age (P = 0.015) in IF compared with CF. CONCLUSIONS: Although no difference is observed in the incidence of diarrhea, consumption of a synbiotic formula containing L. fermentum CECT5716 and GOS in infancy may reduce the incidence of lower respiratory tract infections and affect the immune system and fecal milieu. Additional research is warranted to further investigate the potential interaction of the gut‐lung axis.

CN-02620645,"Gon, G",Improving environmental cleaning: a stepped wedge cluster trial across thirteen Cambodian hospitals,Antimicrobial resistance and infection control,2023,"Introduction: Environmental hygiene is a key component of infection prevention in healthcare, and a driver of healthcare‐associated infections. One of the recommended trainings for improving environmental hygiene for low‐resourced facilities, the TEACH CLEAN package, uses a training of trainers model. A selected cadre “champions” which in turn train their peers with responsibilities on environmental hygiene at the facility level. Early pilot data to test its effectiveness of this training package are very promising. Objectives: The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of an environmental cleaning bundle to improve microbiological cleanliness in Cambodian hospitals‐the CLEAN FRONTLINE study. Methods: TEACH CLEAN was implemented across all hospitals (13) of three provinces in Cambodia. A stepped wedge randomised trial was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the training package to improve microbiological cleanliness in Cambodian hospitals. All facilities received the intervention at four distinct time points‐the timing was randomised. The design included eleven months of data collection. The main outcome is microbiological cleanliness (< 2.5 cfu/ cm2 = clean; ≥ 2.5 cfu/cm2 = not clean) measured using a non‐specific agar on one side for measuring total Aerobic Colony Counts (ACC/ cm2). Along the main impact evaluation, we also conducted a process evaluation based on qualitative interviews and structured questionnaire responses. Results: The cleanliness level during the non‐intervention period was overall 47.4%. We are currently undertaking the main analysis of the trial data and the process evaluation data that we aim to share during the conference. Conclusion: This is the first randomised trial of environmental cleaning in a low‐resource setting.

Azithromycin (AZ) has been shown to improve child survival and infant growth outcomes. This study aimed to assess the impact of AZ on Bifidobacterium infantis colonization and bacterial enteropathogen count in the infant gut. METHODS: We analyzed clinical, biomarker, B. infantis and enteropathogen data from 150 mother‐infant dyads from the MUMTA Lactating Women study. Colonization of B. infantis was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of fecal samples. We utilized a customized PCR‐based TaqMan Array Card for enteropathogen detection. RESULTS: AZ administration was associated with a 1.99‐fold (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.33‐2.97) increase in colonization by B. infantis. B. infantis colonization was highest when inflammatory biomarker levels were within normal range. Mode of delivery (RR 2.43; 95% CI: 1.58, 3.76) and colostrum (RR2.05; 95% CI: 1.41, 2.98) given to the infant within 24 h of birth were associated with B. infantis colonization. A single dose of AZ on day 42 reduced bacterial enteropathogen count in the AZ group on day 56, as compared to the pre‐AZ count. Bacterial enteropathogen count for infants with wasting (weight for length z‐score WLZ <‐2) was 1.43‐fold higher (95% CI: 1.00‐2.03) than for infants with WLZ ≥ ‐2.

SER‐109 is an investigational microbiome therapeutic composed of purified Firmicutes spores for the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled trial in which patients who had had three or more episodes of C. difficile infection (inclusive of the qualifying acute episode) received SER‐109 or placebo (four capsules daily for 3 days) after standard‐of‐care antibiotic treatment. The primary efficacy objective was to show superiority of SER‐109 as compared with placebo in reducing the risk of C. difficile infection recurrence up to 8 weeks after treatment. Diagnosis by toxin testing was performed at trial entry, and randomization was stratified according to age and antibiotic agent received. Analyses of safety, microbiome engraftment, and metabolites were also performed. RESULTS: Among the 281 patients screened, 182 were enrolled. The percentage of patients with recurrence of C. difficile infection was 12% in the SER‐109 group and 40% in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.58; P<0.001 for a relative risk of <1.0; P<0.001 for a relative risk of <0.833). SER‐109 led to less frequent recurrence than placebo in analyses stratified according to age stratum (relative risk, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.78] for patients <65 years of age and 0.36 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.72] for those ≥65 years) and antibiotic received (relative risk, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.22 to 0.79] with vancomycin and 0.09 [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.63] with fidaxomicin). Most adverse events were mild to moderate and were gastrointestinal in nature, with similar numbers in the two groups. SER‐109 dose species were detected as early as week 1 and were associated with bile‐acid profiles that are known to inhibit C. difficile spore germination. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptom resolution of C. difficile infection after treatment with standard‐of‐care antibiotics, oral administration of SER‐109 was superior to placebo in reducing the risk of recurrent infection.

A recent placebo‐controlled clinical trial found a 39% reduction in UTI symptoms among recurrent UTI sufferers who consumed a daily cranberry beverage for 24 weeks. Using metagenomic sequencing of stool from a subset of these trial participants, we assessed the impact of cranberry consumption on the gut microbiota, a reservoir for UTI‐causing pathogens such as Escherichia coli, which causes > 80% of UTIs. Results: The overall taxonomic composition, community diversity, carriage of functional pathways and gene families, and relative abundances of the vast majority of observed bacterial taxa, including E. coli, were not changed significantly by cranberry consumption. However, one unnamed Flavonifractor species (OTU41), which represented ≤1% of the overall metagenome, was significantly less abundant in cranberry consumers compared to placebo at trial completion. Given Flavonifractor’s association with negative human health effects, we sought to determine OTU41 characteristic genes that may explain its differential abundance and/or relationship to key host functions. Using comparative genomic and metagenomic techniques, we identified genes in OTU41 related to transport and metabolism of various compounds, including tryptophan and cobalamin, which have been shown to play roles in host‐microbe interactions. Conclusion: While our results indicated that cranberry juice consumption had little impact on global measures of the microbiome, we found one unnamed Flavonifractor species differed significantly between study arms. This suggests further studies are needed to assess the role of cranberry consumption and Flavonifractor in health and wellbeing in the context of recurrent UTI.

The study included eighty patients with moderate and severe IBS‐D who were randomized to receive synbiotics or placebo for eight weeks. Finally, a total of sixty‐eight patients finished the study. The primary endpoints included the assessment of the symptoms’ severity with IBS symptom severity scale (IBS‐SSS), an improvement of IBS global symptoms with Global Improvement Scale (IBS‐GIS) and adequate relief of symptoms after four and eight weeks of therapy. Secondary endpoints, which were collected by telephone interviewers three times a week included the assessment of individual IBS symptoms and adverse events. Synbiotic treatment in comparison to placebo significantly improved IBS‐GIS (p = 0.043), and IBS‐SSS score inducing a decrease in the total IBS‐SSS (p = 0.042) and in domain‐specific scores related to flatulence (p = 0.028) and bowel habit (p = 0.028) after four and eight weeks. Patients treated with synbiotics reported in weekly observations a significant amelioration in a feeling of incomplete bowel movements, flatulence, pain, stool pressure and diarrheal stools compared to those receiving placebo. There were no differences in adverse events between both groups.

In a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled rhinovirus (RV16) challenge study, healthy volunteers were randomized to consume placebo (0.0 g/day) (N = 46), low‐dose (0.3 g/day) (N = 49) or high‐dose (1.5 g/day) (N = 51) of carrot derived rhamnogalacturonan‐I (cRG‐I) for eight weeks and they were subsequently challenged with RV‐16. Here, the effect of 8‐week cRG‐I supplementation on the gut microbiota was studied. While the overall gut microbiota composition in the population was generally unaltered by this very low dose of fibre, the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. (mainly B. adolescentis and B. longum) was significantly increased by both doses of cRG‐1. Moreover, daily supplementation of cRG‐I led to a dose‐dependent reduction in inter‐ and intra‐individual microbiota heterogeneity, suggesting a stabilizing effect on the gut microbiota. The severity of respiratory symptoms did not directly correlate with the cRG‐I‐induced microbial changes, but several dominant groups of the Ruminococcaceae family and microbiota richness were positively associated with a reduced and hence desired post‐infection response. Thus, the present results on the modulation of the gut microbiota composition support the previously demonstrated immunomodulatory and protective effect of cRG‐I during a common cold infection.",174,,116561,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 38593705,EMBASE 2031502302,,,,Journal article,"*Bifidobacterium; *Dietary Supplements; *Gastrointestinal Microbiome [drug effects]; *Healthy Volunteers; *Pectins [administration & dosage, pharmacology]; *common cold; *intestine flora; *supplementation; Adult; Aged; Article; Bifidobacterium [drug effects]; Carrot; Controlled study; Double blind procedure; Double‐Blind Method; Feces [microbiology]; Female; Human; Human experiment; Humans; Low drug dose; Male; Middle Aged; Nonhuman; Normal human; Oral drug administration; Randomized controlled trial; Respiratory tract infection; Rhinovirus [drug effects]; Ruminococcaceae; Young Adult",10.1016/j.biopha.2024.116561,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02687053/full,

Gastrointestinal and liver physiology,2020,"Antibiotic treatment is a standard therapy for Clostridioides difficile infection, but dysbiosis of the gut microbiota due to antibiotic exposure is also a major risk factor for the disease. Following an initial episode of C. difficile infection, a relentless cycle of recurrence can occur, where persistent treatment‐related dysbiosis predisposes the patient to subsequent relapse. This study uses a longitudinal study design to compare the effects of a narrow‐spectrum (ridinilazole) or broad‐spectrum antibiotic (vancomycin) on intestinal bile acid profiles and their associations with gut bacteria over the course of C. difficile infection treatment. At the end of treatment (day 10), subjects receiving vancomycin showed a nearly 100‐fold increase in the ratio of conjugated to secondary bile acids in their stool compared with baseline, whereas subjects receiving ridinilazole maintained this ratio near baseline levels. Correlation analysis detected significant positive associations between secondary bile acids and several Bacteroidales and Clostridiales families. These families were depleted in the vancomycin group but preserved at near‐baseline abundance in the ridinilazole group. Enterobacteriaceae, which expanded to a greater extent in the vancomycin group, correlated negatively and positively with secondary and conjugated primary bile acids, respectively. Bile acid ratios at the end of treatment were significantly different between those who recurred and those who did not. These results indicate that a narrow‐spectrum antibiotic maintains an intestinal bile acid profile associated with a lowered risk of recurrence.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to demonstrate in humans the relationships between Clostridioides difficile antibiotic treatment choice and bile acid metabolism both during therapy and after treatment cessation.

Objective: To determine whether a daily oral probiotic combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis BB‐12 compared with placebo reduces antibiotic administration in care home residents. Design, Setting, and Participants: Placebo‐controlled randomized clinical trial of 310 care home residents, aged 65 years and older, recruited from 23 care homes in the United Kingdom between December 2016 and May 2018, with last follow‐up on October 31, 2018. Interventions: Study participants were randomized to receive a daily capsule containing a probiotic combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis BB‐12 (total cell count per capsule, 1.3 × 1010to 1.6 × 1010) (n = 155), or daily matched placebo (n = 155), for up to 1 year. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was cumulative antibiotic administration days for all‐cause infections measured from randomization for up to 1 year. Results: Among 310 randomized care home residents (mean age, 85.3 years; 66.8% women), 195 (62.9%) remained alive and completed the trial. Participant diary data (daily data including study product use, antibiotic administration, and signs of infection) were available for 98.7% randomized to the probiotic group and 97.4% randomized to placebo. Care home residents randomized to the probiotic group had a mean of 12.9 cumulative systemic antibiotic administration days (95% CI, 0 to 18.05), and residents randomized to placebo had a mean of 12.0 days (95% CI, 0 to 16.95) (absolute difference, 0.9 days [95% CI, ‐3.25 to 5.05]; adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.63]; P =.50). A total of 120 care home residents experienced 283 adverse events (150 adverse events in the probiotic group and 133 in the placebo group). Hospitalizations accounted for 94 of the events in probiotic group and 78 events in the placebo group, and deaths accounted for 33 of the events in the probiotic group and 32 of the events in the placebo group. Conclusions and Relevance: Among care home residents in the United Kingdom, a daily dose of a probiotic combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis BB‐12 did not significantly reduce antibiotic administration for all‐cause infections. These findings do not support the use of probiotics in this setting.

We performed a randomized, controlled trial to investigate the effects of a low FODMAP diet on persistent gut symptoms, the intestinal microbiome, and circulating markers of inflammation in patients with quiescent IBD. METHODS: We performed a single‐blind trial of 52 patients with quiescent Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and persistent gut symptoms at 2 large gastroenterology clinics in the United Kingdom. Patients were randomly assigned to groups that followed a diet low in FODMAPs (n = 27) or a control diet (n = 25), with dietary advice, for 4 weeks. Gut symptoms and health‐related quality of life were measured using validated questionnaires. Stool and blood samples were collected at baseline and end of trial. We assessed fecal microbiome composition and function using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and phenotypes of T cells in blood using flow cytometry. RESULTS: A higher proportion of patients reported adequate relief of gut symptoms following the low FODMAP diet (14/27, 52%) than the control diet (4/25, 16%, P=.007). Patients had a greater reduction in irritable bowel syndrome severity scores following the low FODMAP diet (mean reduction of 67; standard error, 78) than the control diet (mean reduction of 34; standard error, 50), although this difference was not statistically significant (P = .075). Following the low FODMAP diet, patients had higher health‐related quality of life scores (81.9 ± 1.2) than patients on the control diet (78.3 ± 1.2, P = .042). A targeted analysis revealed that in stool samples collected at the end of the study period, patients on the low FODMAP diet had significantly lower abundance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii than patients on control diet. However, microbiome diversity and markers of inflammation did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In a trial of the low FODMAP diet vs a control diet in patients with quiescent IBD, we found no significant difference after 4 weeks in change in irritable bowel syndrome severity scores, but significant improvements in specific symptom scores and numbers reporting adequate symptom relief. The low FODMAP diet reduced fecal abundance of microbes believed to regulate the immune response, compared with the control diet, but had no significant effect on markers of inflammation. We conclude that a 4‐week diet low in FODMAPs is safe and effective for managing persistent gut symptoms in patients with quiescent IBD. www.isrctn.com no.: ISRCTN17061468.",158,1,176‐188.e7,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 31586453,EMBASE 629524789,,,,Journal article,"*Crohn disease; *intestine flora; *low FODMAP diet; *quality of life; *rectum hemorrhage; Adult; Article; Bacteria [isolation & purification]; Bifidobacterium adolescentis; Biomarkers [analysis]; Controlled study; Diet, Carbohydrate‐Restricted [adverse effects, *methods]; Disaccharides [adverse effects]; Drug therapy; Faecalibacterium prausnitzii; Feces [microbiology]; Female; Flow cytometry; Gastroenterology; Gastrointestinal Microbiome [*immunology]; Human; Human cell; Human tissue; Humans; Immune response; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases [diagnosis, *diet therapy, microbiology]; Irritable colon; Major clinical study; Male; Metagenomics; Middle Aged; Monosaccharides [adverse effects]; Multicenter study; Nonhuman; Phenotype; Quality of Life; Questionnaire; Randomized controlled trial; Severity of Illness Index; Single blind procedure; Single‐Blind Method; T lymphocyte; Treatment Outcome; Ulcerative colitis; United Kingdom; Young Adult",10.1053/j.gastro.2019.09.024,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01996227/full,

This study investigated the heterogeneity of these treatments’ effects based on individual pathogen and EED biomarker status with respect to child linear growth. Methods: We applied cross‐validated targeted maximum likelihood estimation and super learner ensemble machine learning to assess the conditional treatment effects in subgroups defined by biomarker and pathogen status. We analyzed treatment (N+WSH, WSH, N, or control) randomly assigned in‐utero, child pathogen and EED data at 14 months of age, and child LAZ at 28 months of age. We estimated the difference in mean child length for age Z‐score (LAZ) under the treatment rule and the difference in stratified treatment effect (treatment effect difference) comparing children with high versus low pathogen/biomarker status while controlling for baseline covariates. Results: We analyzed data from 1,522 children, who had median LAZ of ‐1.56. We found that myeloperoxidase (N+WSH treatment effect difference 0.0007 LAZ, WSH treatment effect difference 0.1032 LAZ, N treatment effect difference 0.0037 LAZ) and Campylobacter infection (N+WSH treatment effect difference 0.0011 LAZ, WSH difference 0.0119 LAZ, N difference 0.0255 LAZ) were associated with greater effect of all interventions on growth. In other words, children with high myeloperoxidase or Campylobacter infection experienced a greater impact of the interventions on growth. We found that a treatment rule that assigned the N+WSH (LAZ difference 0.23, 95% CI (0.05, 0.41)) and WSH (LAZ difference 0.17, 95% CI (0.04, 0.30)) interventions based on EED biomarkers and pathogens increased predicted child growth compared to the randomly allocated intervention.

Research indicates that the gut microbiota significantly influences KOA, potentially affecting inflammation and disease progression through the gut‐joint axis. Traditional treatments like non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs offer symptom relief but have adverse effects. Emerging therapies like electroacupuncture (EA) and Tuina (TN) have shown promise in alleviating pain and improving joint function by targeting the gut microbiota. AIM To clarify the efficacy of EA with TN in treating KOA and its effect on gut microbiota regulation. METHODS Sixty patients with KOA were allocated to EA or EA + TN (ET) group (n = 30 each). Seven acupoints were punctured. The ET group received TN after each EA session. Both groups completed 12 sessions. The visual analog scale (VAS) for assessing pain and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) for measuring pain intensity, joint stiffness, and functional capacity were employed to assess clinical outcomes. Pre‐ and post‐treatment fecal specimens underwent 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing to analyze the gut microbiota. RESULTS The ET group showed higher rates of “effective” and “markedly effective” outcomes. The VAS score of the ET group remained significantly lower than that of the EA group (P < 0.001) immediately after treatment and 1 week post‐treatment. The total WOMAC score (P < 0.001), pain (P = 0.191), stiffness (P = 0.015), and function scores (P < 0.001) decreased significantly in the ET group post‐treatment. The gut microbiota analysis revealed no significant changes in alpha diversity in either group. Beta‐diversity analysis indicated distinct patterns in the ET group before and after treatment. Significant changes in microbial abundance were detected in both groups, highlighting variations in Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether supplementation with a microalgae extract from Tetradesmus obliquus strain Mi175.B1.a (TOME) influences gut health and reduces stress and anxiety in healthy adults experiencing mild to moderate gastrointestinal (GI) distress. Methods: Fifty‐six healthy adults (age: 31.9 ± 7.7 years; body weight: 71.8 ± 12.6 kg; BMI: 24.6 ± 2.8 kg/m2) were enrolled in a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐arm clinical trial. Participants were randomly allocated to receive capsules containing either 250 mg/day of TOME or a placebo for four weeks. Primary outcomes included the assessment of GI symptoms using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and Bristol Stool Scale (BSS). Secondary outcomes focused on subjective evaluation of mood, stress, and anxiety, as well as blood pressure responses to sympathetic nervous system activation induced by the cold pressor test (CPT). In addition, stool, plasma, and saliva samples were collected to assess biomarkers associated with stress, sympathetic activation, intestinal permeability, and GI health. 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to analyze changes in gut microbial populations. Results: Daily supplementation for four weeks with TOME was safe and well tolerated in the study population. In addition, TOME significantly reduced GSRS global scores (p = 0.02), as well as constipation (p = 0.05) and indigestion (p = 0.03) subcomponent scores compared to Placebo. There was also a significant increase in Shannon’s index before FDR correction (p = 0.05; FDR = 0.12) and stool butyrate level was significantly lower in the TOME group than in Placebo after 4 weeks of supplementation (p = 0.039). Both groups showed a significant reduction in perceived stress scores, but the TOME intervention group also had reduced Negative Affect scores (p < 0.001). In addition, plasma chromogranin A, a stress biomarker, was significantly reduced after TOME intervention (p = 0.03). There were no negative effects on blood lipids or other parameters related to sympathetic activation or cardiovascular health. Conclusions: Overall, these results suggest that 4‐week supplementation with T. obliquus strain Mi175.B1.a improves GI symptoms, potentially through effects on the gut microbiota, and may promote positive effects on mental health. Additional research should follow up on mental health outcomes in populations with increased stress and anxiety and investigate mechanisms underlying improvements in GI health.

About 50% of women have urinary tract infections at least once in their lifetime (Gilbert, O'bien, Hutgen et al., 2013). In the presence of urinary tract infection, painful urination is usually observed, frequent emergency toilet trips, while other symptoms include lower abdominal or pelvic pain and pressure, blood in the urine, milky, cloudy or pink/red urine color, fever, heavily scented urine, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea (Habak and Griggs Dec, 2023). Pregnancy, number of pregnancies, age, diabetes mellitus, urethrogenital anomalies, genetic and behavioral factors, hygiene deficiency, anemia, history of urinary system infection (Bekzac, Orgul, Tanacan et al., 2019), factors such as low socio‐economic level, inadequate perineal hygiene, vaginal douching, long‐term use of antibiotics and steroids, smoking, alcohol consumption and immune deficiencies increase the incidence (Özdemir, Ortabağ, Tosun et al., 2012; Ejder Apay, Özdemir, Nazik et al., 2014; Karahan, 2017). The frequency of sexual experience, the number of sexual partners (current or previous years), not urinating after sexual intercourse, the direction of wiping the perineum after the toilet, urine retention, daily insufficient water consumption also play an important role (Seid, Markas, Aklilu et al., 2023). Physiological, anatomical and hormonal changes experienced during pregnancy increase the predisposition to urinary tract infection (Helli, Dolapçıoğlu and Hammer, 2011). Urinary tract infection has a prevalence rate of 20% among pregnant women (Abdel‐ Deciz Elzayat, Barnett‐Vanes, Dabour et al., 2013; Salari, Khoshbakht, Hemmati et al., 2023). Approximately 5‐12% of pregnant women are affected by asymptomatic bacteria, while 30% of women with symptoms may develop cystitis or 50% pyelonephritis. Asymptomatic bacteriuria can lead to many undesirable maternal and neonatal problems if left untreated (De Oliveira Neto et al., 2021). Preeclampsia can cause undesirable consequences such as hypertensive diseases, pyelonephritis, permanent kidney damage, anemia, premature rupture of membranes, premature birth threat, low birth weight, fetal deaths and cesarean section (Lawani, Alade and Oyelaran, 2015; Willy, Wanyoike and Mugo, 2015). These are conditions that cause many physiological and anatomical damages and are common, requiring urgent treatment (Sevil, Özdemir, Aleattin et al., 2013; Apay, Özdemir, Nazik et al., 2014; Karahan, 2017). In addition, more than half of the patients complain of clinical depression and 38.5% of them complain of anxiety. It is reported that significant improvement in quality of life has been observed after appropriate treatment and prophylaxis (Renard, Ballarini, Mascarenhas et al., 2015). It is an important public health problem and can negatively affect the life of women and families, causing deterioration of the quality of life (Sevil, Özdemir, Aleattin et al., 2013; Apay, Özdemir, Nazik et al., 2014; Karahan, 2017). It causes a significant financial impact of up to billions of dollars on both the health system and society (Akram, Shahid and Khan, 2007; Martini, Horner, Roehrs et al., 2007; De Oliveira Neto et al., 2021). Therefore, it is important to plan and implement initiatives aimed at improving and preventing urinary tract infections. When the studies were examined, it was found that incorrect, incomplete or faulty hygiene behaviors increased the incidence of urinary tract infections (Özdemir et al., 2012; Sevil et al., 2013; Karahan, 2017). In urinary tract infections, it is necessary to determine the wrong behaviors first about hygiene and to provide permanent and positive behavioral changes by providing trainings for them (Karahan, 2017). Genital hygiene behaviors are an important factor in the formation and prevention of urinary tract infections. Öner and Çeber Turfan (2020) stated that in addition to medical treatment, urinary tract infection symptoms can be prevented with hygiene education and that it also positively affects genital hygiene behaviors (Öner and Çe October Turfan, 2020). Regarding the educational methods, Sinan et al. A study conducted by (2020) concluded that genital infection awareness training based on the knowledge‐motivation‐behavior skills model increases women's knowledge level and positively reinforces women's hygiene behaviors (Sinan, Kaplan, Sahin et al., 2020). In another study conducted on genital hygiene behavior training given using audiovisual and brochure, it was found that the intervention group developed more positive behaviors than the control group (Hayati et al., 2018). Parlas and Eryilmaz (2023) It is stated that the knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of women who receive education based on the PRECEDE‐PROCEED model are positively affected (Parlas & Eryilmaz, 2023). In particular, in another study, it is stated that planned education and home visits on genital hygiene have a positive effect (Abic, Yatmaz, Altınışık et al., 2024). In addition, web‐based genital hygiene education has a positive effect on self‐care power and genital hygiene behaviors (Gül and Yağmur, 2023), peer education provided under the guidance of the health improvement model is effective and increases the knowledge levels of young October adults about genital hygiene behaviors (Polat, Küçükkelepçe et al., 2022) is stated. Another study conducted to determine the effect of genital hygiene education given by three different methods, oral education after medical curettage, education with written material and just demonstration on genital hygiene behaviors, found that oral education alone is not effective in providing and developing genital hygiene behaviors, and the demonstration method is more effective than oral and written education methods (Uzun and Göktaş, 2022). As a result of the current literature review, although the importance of genital hygiene education is emphasized, it is clear that there is a need for teaching techniques that will provide permanent behavioral changes. Midwives, who are in contact the most during the pregnancy period and conduct face‐to‐face interviews, undertake the most important task in teaching genital hygiene behaviors effectively and correctly (Ünsal, Özyazıcıoğu, Sezgin et al. 2010). For this reason, midwives should plan training with a permanent teaching technique that fills in gaps in the lack of knowledge, can get feedback, can be evaluated, while advising pregnant women diagnosed with urinary tract infection on genital hygiene behaviors. The teach back method is a method used for the education, learning, evaluation and development of personal care behaviors of individuals. This approach provides an opportunity for individuals to understand educational materials, improve their level of retention in mind, and evaluate themselves. One of the important advantages is that the educational content is presented as simply as possible, free from medical terms, and that the clients repeat the practices at the end of the training (Ahmed Abd El‐ hamed, 2023). The practice involves asking patients by a health professional to explain in their own sentences what they have just been told. If there is any misunderstanding, it is clarified by the health professional and the understanding status is evaluated by checking again. This condition continues until the patient tells the truth and remembers the information given to him (Farris, 2015; Talevski, Wong Shee, Rasmussen et al., 2020). The patient's learning about issues related to health information can be improved through continuous feedback. It is stated that this method‐based communication approach helps patients to better understand their own medical conditions and health information, and provides benefits in improving their skills of remembering and applying medical information (Tamura, 2013; Laws, 2018; Cheng, Chen, 2023).The Tell what you have learned method provides positive effects on information acquisition, remembering, keeping in mind, as well as health behavior management, personal care behavior development, hospitalization, quality of life and patient satisfaction (Yen and Leasure, 2019; Talevski et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2023). In addition, it is stated that self‐care increases strength and comfort, reduces the cost of health care (Badeczewski et al., 2017; Imanipour, Molazem, Rakhshan et al., 2022). For this reason, midwives can use the tell what you've learned method, which is a permanent teaching technique that fills in gaps in the lack of information, can be reversed, evaluated, while advising pregnant women diagnosed with urinary tract infection on genital hygiene behaviors. Pregnant women diagnosed with urinary tract infection have been given trainings on genital hygiene behaviors in many different methods in the literature, but when the trainings given were examined, it was determined that teaching techniques aimed at improving the education, learning level, evaluation and personal care behaviors of individuals are needed. It is thought that using the tell what you have learned method in order to fill these gaps in education will be beneficial. In this context, the fact that there are no studies on the subject in our country, the fact that evidence‐based teaching techniques are tried in new areas constitutes the original value of the project and our main motivation. The project has unique value for a sustainable future in terms of its effects on pregnant women in particular and qualified midwifery care at the social level in general. It will also enable data to be obtained for comparing innovative educational methods with traditional educational methods. Thus, it will help to improve, organize or develop capacity for future initiatives. Hypotheses 1. The education given to pregnant women who have been diagnosed with urinary tract infection by the tell me what you have learned method positively affects genital hygiene behavior. 2.

Observational studies suggest that probiotic administration and diet shifts may treat diet‐related diseases. However, the effect of these interventions on the colonic mucosa has not yet been elucidated. This study investigated the efficacy of probiotic supplementation and dietary intervention as prophylactic tools under high‐fat diet conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 36 volunteers that normally consumed a high‐fat diet were enrolled and treated with either a control diet, a low‐fat dietary intervention, Bifidobacterium triple viable capsule therapy, or a combination of a low‐fat diet and Bifidobacterium triple viable capsule therapy. Pyrosequencing of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA genes was conducted to determine the extent to which probiotics and dietary intervention altered the mucosal microbiota. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that interventional treatment with probiotics and a low‐fat diet increased the diversity of the mucosal microbes, dietary intervention alone produced the most significant effect, whereas the combined intervention exhibited no synergetic improvement. Pyrosequencing demonstrated that probiotics and dietary intervention significantly elevated the abundance of some bacterial taxa assigned to the phylum Firmicutes and the beneficial genera Prevotella, Gemmiger, Coprococcus, and Faecalibacterium and reduced some harmful bacterial taxa assigned to the phylum Proteobacteria and genus Streptophyta.

Probiotics is a promising intervention to improving intestinal dysbiosis. A double‐blind clinical trial to investigate the ability of probiotics to modulate gut microbiota compositions in patients receiving hemodialysis (HD) was undertaken. METHODS: Fifty HD patients were enrolled and randomized, receiving either probiotics or placebo for 6 months. The responses to the interventions on gut microbiome, serum and fecal metabolome, serum albumin and endotoxin, endothelial activation markers and inflammatory markers were assessed. RESULTS: Totally, 22 in the probiotics group (11 males; 14 non‐diabetic) and 23 in the placebo group (13 males; 17 non‐diabetic) completed the study. Compared to that in the placebo group, probiotics did not significantly alter species diversity of the fecal microbiome. Probiotics did, however, restore the community composition, with particular significance in non‐diabetic HD patients (P = 0.007 by Adonis analysis). Specifically, according to the results of linear discriminate analysis effect size, probiotics raised the proportions of family Bacteroidaceae and Enterococcaceae, and reduced Ruminococcaceae, Halomonadaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Clostridiales Family XIII.

Additional therapeutic arsenals, albeit untested in the given context but previously proven to be efficacious in a related clinical context, that could reduce the morbidity rate are urgently needed. A decrease of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a validated bad prognosis marker in sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In contrast, auricular vagus nerve stimulation was proven not only to increase HRV values in healthy Humans, but also to reduce sepsis and increase survival, both significantly, in experimental models. Moreover, the heavy viral infection within the brainstem of deceased patients suggests that the neuroinvasive potential of SARS‐CoV2 is likely to be partially responsible for COVID‐19 acute respiratory failure and may bear relevance in tailoring future treatment modalities. Interestingly, the vagus nerve (or tenth cranial nerve) connects bidirectionally the brainstem to various internal organs including the lung and to one external organ, namely, the outer ear.

According to this classification, patients are dividedinto 5 groups, from level 1, who can walk without any problems, to level 5, who iswheelchair‐bound.General Headings of Each Level:Level i: walks without restriction. Level ii: walks with restrictions. Level iii: walksusing hand‐held mobility devices. Level iv: self‐motion is limited. Can use motorizedmobility device. Level v: transported in a manually propelled wheelchair. Bladder andbowel diary: It is a form recorded by the child or his/her parents in a 48‐hour period,in which the child daily schedule records the amount of fluid he/she takes in andexcretes, the frequency of urination, the frequency of urinary incontinence, the activityin which the incontinence occurs, the stool he/she makes throughout the day, and thequality of the stool.Voiding Disorders Symptom Score (VBSS): Voiding Disturbances Symptom Score (VBSS), whichwas developed by Akbal et al. and whose validity and reliability have been proven,includes 14 questions.

Pelvic floor andabdominal muscle activation was performed with the same device (NeuroTrac myoplus 4,Verity Medical Ltd, UK), which can take measurements from two different channels at thesame time. Activation will be checked at the initial and final evaluation and before eachbiofeedback exercise training to determine the condition of the pelvic floor andabdominal muscles. With EMG, muscle strength, endurance, speed, coordination, oscillationand relaxation time data will be recorded.Quality of life measure for children (PedQL): The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory(Children Hospital and Health Center, San Diego, California) is a modular instrument usedto measure health‐related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents ages 2 to18 years. PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales are multidimensional child self‐report andparent proxy report scales developed as generic core measures to be integrated withPedsQL Disease‐Specific Modules. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales consist of 23 itemsvalid for healthy school and community populations as well as pediatric populations withacute and chronic health conditions.Educational Programs Urotherapy Training: Standard urotherapy is a combined method thatincludes clinical assessment (recording voiding frequencies, voiding volumes, andincontinence episodes in a bladder diary), voiding habit training, behavior modificationinstructions, lifestyle recommendations regarding fluid intake, and supporting childrenand their parents through the process. 1. An important part of urotherapy is to provide parents and children with detailedexplanations of etiology, prevalence and pathophysiology. This will reassure parentsand help them understand the causes of the child&amp;#39;s bedwetting accidentsand the rationale for treatment. This will increase compliance with treatment. 2. Recommendations are given regarding appropriate fluid intake and regular voidingthroughout the day. The child is encouraged to go to the toilet seven times a dayand drink seven glasses of water. 3. The correct sitting position for the toilet is explained. If the feet do not touchthe floor easily, it is recommended to use a step stool for foot support.Additionally, children are taught to relax their abdomen when peeing. 4. In addition to monitoring and motivation, a bladder diary should be kept to give thechild and parents an idea about the progress of treatment, compliance with treatmentand continuity.Exercise Training: Urotherapy training will be given at the beginning of the treatmentprocess. Contraction and relaxation will be applied around the external sphincter incombination with diaphragmatic breathing by visual imagery with EMG biofeedbackapplication. The second channel EMG will be placed on the transversus abdominus muscleand its activation will be checked. The treatment will be completed with 30‐minutesessions twice a week for 12 weeks.

Postoperativesham feeding uses gum to promote healing of gastrointestinal peristalsis. Although notfully understood, the physiological theory underlying gum chewing (fake feeding) tostimulate peristalsis and reduce postoperative intestinal recovery time is that the oraland chewing stimulation provided by chewing gum stimulates a neurohumoral reflex thatincreases gastrointestinal fluid secretion. This increases gastrointestinal motility. Inaddition, oral stimulation and chewing can stimulate the vagus nerve, which is alsoinvolved in promoting peristalsis. Finally, none of the existing theories adequatelyexplain the effect of chewing/gum chewing on reducing postoperative inflammation in thegut, which may result in a reduced incidence of postoperative infection. Previous studieshave shown that physiological changes associated with gum support normal gastrointestinalfunction and subsequent postoperative/anesthetic recovery.Some studies have shown that chewing gum after colorectal resection reduces postoperativeflatulence and defecation time. showed that it reduces the risk of postoperative ileus.In contrast, some studies in patients undergoing open abdominal surgery or laparoscopyfor various types of colorectal resection have shown no effect of chewing gum onpostoperative first flatulence and time to defecation, has no significant effect inreducing the average hospital stay and has no significant effect in preventingpostoperative nausea, vomiting, or bloating.One possible reason for the inconsistent results of sham feeding using chewing gum toreduce the incidence of postoperative ileus may be differences in underlying colorectalcancer types and heterogeneity between surgical and postoperative care methods.Although many studies have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of chewing gum inpatients undergoing colorectal resection, the results have been inconsistent. This can beattributed to differences in intestinal injuries affecting bowel function, differences intime under anesthesia differences in anesthetics or pain control agents used for paincontrol affecting bowel function, and recovery time of peristalsis. Given the manyfactors known to affect postoperative ileus, chewing gum as an intervention remains asafe, accessible, and inexpensive option that remains to be explored. This study willprovide empirical evidence that contributes to a body of literature supporting gumadministration for affecting postoperative nausea, flatulence, and stool output in awell‐defined sample.Many interventions and strategies have been used to manage postoperative ileus, such asprokinetic agents and epidural anesthesia. However, these methods have limited efficacyand still have a relatively high incidence of postoperative ileus. Alternatively, chewinggum promotes gastrointestinal peristalsis in post‐surgery patients without the adverseeffects associated with early feeding.

We conducted a large‐scale 42‐day randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial to investigate the effect of probiotics in alleviating CC. 163 patients diagnosed with CC (following Rome IV criteria) were randomly divided into probiotic (n = 78; received Lactiplantibacillus plantarum P9 [P9]; 1 ×1011 CFU/day) and placebo (n = 85; received placebo material) groups. Ingesting P9 significantly improved the weekly mean frequency of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) and spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs), while significantly reducing the level of worries and concerns (WO; P < 0.05). Comparing with the placebo group, P9 group was significantly enriched in potentially beneficial bacteria (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Ruminococcus_B gnavus), while depriving of several bacterial and phage taxa (Oscillospiraceae sp., Lachnospiraceae sp., and Herelleviridae; P < 0.05). Interesting significant correlations were also observed between some clinical parameters and subjects' gut microbiome, including: negative correlation between Oscillospiraceae sp. and SBMs; positive correlation between WO and Oscillospiraceae sp., Lachnospiraceae sp. Additionally, P9 group had significantly (P < 0.05) more predicted gut microbial bioactive potential involved in the metabolism of amino acids (L‐asparagine, L‐pipecolinic acid), short‐/medium‐chain fatty acids (valeric acid and caprylic acid). Furthermore, several metabolites (p‐cresol, methylamine, trimethylamine) related to the intestinal barrier and transit decreased significantly after P9 administration (P < 0.05). In short, the constipation relief effect of P9 intervention was accompanied by desirable changes in the fecal metagenome and metabolome.

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 120 toddlers with respiratory illness were randomly assigned to the probiotic (YLGB‐1496) or control group for a 12‐week intervention. Follow‐up examinations were conducted at baseline (week 0) and at weeks 6 and 12 of the intervention. Toddlers' height and weight were measured by trained personnel, and defecation characteristics and gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded by parents or guardians. Stool samples were collected to determine the fecal pH, fecal calprotectin (FC) concentration, and fecal α1‐antitrypsin (AAT) concentration. Results: A total of 115 toddlers completed the 12‐week intervention (58 in the YLGB‐1496 group and 57 in the control group). The height‐for‐age Z score (HAZ) in the YLGB‐1496 group was significantly greater than that in the control group (p = 0.006). The weight‐for‐age Z score (WAZ) in the YLGB‐1496 group increased between weeks 6 and 12, whereas the WAZ in the control group continuously decreased during the intervention. No differences in the frequency or consistency of defecation between the groups were observed. Toddlers in the YLGB‐1496 group had lower incidences of poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomachache, lower abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dehydration (p < 0.05) but higher fecal AAT concentrations (p = 0.008) than did those in the control group.

However, MDA, as a stand‐alone intervention, does not prevent reinfection. Accordingly, complementary measures to prevent STH reinfection, such as health education and improved sanitation, as part of an integrated control approach, are required to augment the effectiveness of MDA for optimal efficiency and sustainability. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the impact and generalizability of a school‐based health education package entitled The Magic Glasses for STH prevention in the Philippines. METHODS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled intervention trial, involving 2020 schoolchildren aged 9‐10 years, in 40 schools in Laguna Province, Philippines, to evaluate the impact of the school‐based health education package for the prevention of STHs. The trial was conducted over the course of 1 year (June 2016 to July 2017). A total of 20 schools were randomly assigned to the intervention arm, in which The Magic Glasses Philippines health education package was delivered with the standard health education activities endorsed by the Philippines Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of Education (DepEd). The other 20 schools comprised the control arm of the study, where the DOH/DepEd's standard health education activities were done. At baseline, parasitological assessments and a knowledge, attitude, and practice survey were carried out in all schools. In addition, height, weight, and hemoglobin levels were obtained from each child (after parental consent), and their school attendance and academic performance in English and mathematics were accessed from the school records. The baseline and 2 follow‐up surveys were completed using the same study measurements and quality‐control assessments. RESULTS: Key results from this cluster randomized intervention trial will shed light on the impact that The Magic Glasses health education package will have against STH infections in schoolchildren in the province of Laguna, located on the Island of Luzon, in the Calabarzon Region of the Philippines. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the trial will be used to assess the generalizability of the impact of The Magic Glasses health education package in different epidemiological and cultural settings, providing evidence for translation of this health education package into public health policy and practice in the Asian region and beyond.

Gastroenterology & hepatology,2022,"Background: The Crohn's disease exclusion diet (CDED) with partial enteral nutrition is effective for induction of remission in children with mild‐to‐moderate Crohn's disease. We aimed to assess the CDED in adults with Crohn's disease. Methods: We did an open‐label, pilot randomised trial at three medical centres in Israel. Eligible patients were biologic naive adults aged 18–55 years with mild‐to‐moderate Crohn's disease (defined by a Harvey–Bradshaw Index score of 5–14 points), a maximal disease duration of 5 years, with active disease on colonoscopy, or imaging with elevated inflammatory markers (C‐reactive protein >5 mg/L or faecal calprotectin concentration >200 μ/g). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to CDED plus partial enteral nutrition or CDED alone for 24 weeks. Randomisation was via block randomisation (block sizes of six) using sealed, numbered, and opaque envelopes. Patients and investigators were aware of which group patients were assigned to due to the nature of the different interventions. The primary endpoint was clinical remission, defined as a Harvey–Bradshaw Index score of less than 5 at week 6. The primary endpoint was assessed in the intention‐to‐treat (ITT) population, which included all patients who used the dietary therapy for at least 48 h. We report results of the final analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02231814. Findings: Between Jan 12, 2017, and May 11, 2020, 91 patients were screened, of whom 44 were randomly assigned to the CDED plus partial enteral nutrition group (n=20) or CDED alone group (n=24). 19 patients in the CDED plus partial enteral nutrition group and 21 patients in the CDED alone group received the allocated intervention for at least 48 h and thus were included in the ITT analysis. At week 6, 13 (68%) of 19 patients in the CDED plus partial enteral nutrition group and 12 (57%) of 21 patients in the CDED group had achieved clinical remission (p=0·4618). Among the 25 patients in remission at week 6, 20 (80%) were in sustained remission at week 24 (12 patients in the CDED plus partial enteral nutrition group and eight in the CDED alone group). 14 (35%) of 40 patients were in endoscopic remission at week 24 (eight patients in the CDED plus partial enteral nutrition group and six in the CDED alone group). No serious adverse events or treatment‐related adverse events were reported in either group. Interpretation: CDED with or without partial enteral nutrition was effective for induction and maintenance of remission in adults with mild‐to‐moderate biologic naive Crohn's disease and might lead to endoscopic remission. These data suggest that CDED could be used for mild‐to‐moderate active Crohn's disease and should be assessed in a powered randomised controlled trial.

In this pilot randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of quadruple antibiotic cocktail in addition to intravenous‐corticosteroids (IVCSs) in acute severe colitis (ASC). METHODS: Hospitalized children with ASC (pediatric ulcerative colitis activity index [PUCAI] ≥65) were randomized into 2 arms: the first received antibiotics in addition to IVCS (amoxicillin, vancomycin, metronidazole, doxycycline/ciprofloxacin [IVCS+AB]), whereas the other received only IVCS for 14 days. The primary outcome was disease activity (PUCAI) at day 5. Microbiome was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene and metagenome. RESULTS: Twenty‐eight children were included: 16 in the AB + IVCS arm and 12 in the IVCS arm (mean age 13.9 ± 4.1 years and 23 [82%] with extensive colitis). The mean day‐5 PUCAI was 25 ± 16.7 vs 40.4 ± 20.4, respectively (P = 0.037). Only 3 and 2 children, respectively, required colectomy during 1‐year follow‐up (P = 0.89). Microbiome data at time of admission were analyzed for 25 children, of whom 17 (68%) had a predominant bacterial species (>33% abundance); response was not associated with the specific species, whereas decreased microbiome diversity at admission was associated with day‐5 response in the IVCS arm. CONCLUSION: Patients with ASC have alterations in the microbiome characterized by loss of diversity and presence of predominant bacterial species. Quadruple therapy in addition to IVCS improved disease activity on day 5, but larger studies are needed to determine whether this is associated with improved long‐term outcomes (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02033408).",26,11,1733‐1742,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 31833543,EMBASE 630193413,,,,Journal article,"*microbiome; *ulcerative colitis; Acute Disease; Administration, Intravenous; Adolescent; Adrenal Cortex Hormones [*administration & dosage]; Anti‐Bacterial Agents [*administration & dosage]; Article; Child; Clinical article; Colitis, Ulcerative [*drug therapy, *microbiology]; Colon resection; Comparative effectiveness; Controlled study; Drug Therapy, Combination; Drug combination; Drug therapy; Feces [microbiology]; Female; Follow up; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Hospitalized child; Human; Humans; Male; Metagenome; Nonhuman; Pilot Projects; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S [analysis]; Randomized controlled trial; Severity of Illness Index; Surgery; Treatment Outcome",10.1093/ibd/izz298,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02050167/full,

US data showed a 70% enrollment reduction in April and a 38% reduction in July 2020, compared to prepandemic rates. We implemented processes during the initial phase of the pandemic to minimize participant and staff viral exposure, develop remote procedures, and ease communication barriers, while still maintaining enrollment goals. Methods: Our stroke research team developed multiple processes to help mitigate pandemic effects on our enrollment. We developed watchlists for eligible and interested patients who could not be enrolled due to national and local restrictions. As research staff was unable to approach patients in person, phone and email scripts were developed to ensure information was disseminated in a consistent fashion. Remote and alternate consent methods were implemented. We tracked the evolving national and local guideline changes, and began re‐opening trials on May 23, 2020. We implemented a rotating pool of coordinators, including a site‐specific sanitation plan, once it was safe to be on campus in‐person. In person meetings were moved to a virtual platform. Enrollment data across for 10 active subacute stroke studies, each active over the 3 years of, 2018‐2020, was analyzed for the months from March to June, with 2020 individually compared to 2018 and 2019 via the Student T‐Test. Results: Total enrollment during these 4 months were 15 participants in 2018, 11 in 2019, and 15 in 2020, with no statistical difference between the years. No study patients nor staff contracted symptoms of COVID‐19. Conclusion: Enrollment shows no significant changes despite COVID‐19. New processes allowedthe timely reopening of clinical trials, an overall maintenance of enrollment rates, including a non‐significant increase in 2020 compared to previous years.

However, few studies have been conducted to investigate whether IN is effective even in treatment‐refractory cases, such as in those with steroid dependency and anti‐TNF refractoriness. METHODS: In the INDIGO study, 86 patients with active UC were randomly assigned to an IN group (0.5‐2.0 g daily) or placebo group. The rate of clinical response (CR), mucosal healing (MH), and change in fecal calprotectin (FCP) levels was compared between refractory [patients with steroid‐dependent disease, previous use of anti‐TNF‐α, and concomitant use of immunomodulators (IM)] and non‐refractory patients. We also analyzed factors predicting CR and MH at week 8. RESULTS: The rates of CR of IN group were significantly higher than placebo group, even in patients with steroid‐dependent disease (p < 0.001), previous use of anti‐TNF‐α (p = 0.002), and concomitant use of IM (p = 0.013). The rates of MH in IN group were significantly higher than in placebo group in patients with steroid‐dependent disease (p = 0.009). In the IN group, median FCP levels, at week 8, were significantly lower than baseline in patients with steroid‐dependent disease and patients with the previous use of anti‐TNF‐α (p < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that the previous use of anti‐TNF‐α was not a predictive factor for CR and MH at week 8.

Serine proteases modulate FK506 binding protein (FKBP)‐type peptidylprolyl cis‐trans isomerase (PPIase) activity associated with immune and glucocorticoid receptor functions. The aim was to investigate whether camostat mesilate (CM), a serine protease inhibitor, modifies fecal bacterial function related to FKBP‐type PPIases in patients with IBS. METHODS: Randomly assigned 16 patients with IBS received 200 mg po tid of CM and 16 patients received placebo for 14 days. Self‐reported adequate relief (AR) as a primary endpoint, IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS‐SSS), and colonic motor and pain thresholds to colorectal distention were assessed before and after treatment. The fecal bacterial content was inferred from 16S rRNA gene sequence data using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. RESULTS: CM significantly increased the relative abundance of Streptococcus and the functional abundances of serine protease and FKBP‐type PPIase FkpA, FklB and SlyD more than placebo after treatment. CM treatment was not superior to placebo in proportion of AR although colonic motor response partially changed. CONCLUSION: CM modulated the fecal microbiome composition and functional potentials that are related to FKBP‐type PPIase activity in IBS patients.

Although the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol was first defined for gastrointestinal surgeries in 2001, it has now been used in gynecological, orthopedic, thoracic and urological surgeries. In our study, we aimed to compare the results of the ERAS protocol with the conventional approach in patients who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Methods: There is a retrospective analysis of 70 patients who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy at Kayseri City Hospital between May 2018 and January 2021. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows, version 25.0 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA). Seventy patients were included in the study. While 48 patients who underwent perioperative care with the traditional approach were included in the conventional group, 22 patients were included in the ERAS group. Age, comorbidities, preoperative PSA level, digital rectal examination findings, preoperative imaging, extra prostatic spread and lymph node involvement, location of tumors, time between biopsy and surgery, lymphadenectomy status, and histopathological findings of transrectal ultrasound biopsy and prostatectomy specimens were recorded for each patient. Initiation of enteral feeding, time to first defecation, duration of antibiotic use, ileus development rate and length of hospital stay (LOS) were compared for both groups. Results: The mean age of 48 patients in the conventional group was 63.37 ± 7.01 years, while the mean age of 22 patients in the ERAS group was 66.36 ± 5.31 years (p = 0.080). Although the first defecation time was shorter in the ERAS group (4.75 ± 3.21 vs. 3.73 ± 2.12 days, p = 0.179), there was no statistically significant difference. Ileus developed in 10 (20.8%) patients in the conventional group and 2 (9.1%) in the ERAS group.

This randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled crossover intervention trial was conducted with 69 participants (36 in Group A, 33 in Group B), aiming to investigate the potential of postbiotics in alleviating diarrhea‐associated symptoms. Participants received postbiotic Probio‐Eco® and placebo for 21 days each in alternating order, with a 14‐day washout period between interventions. The results showed that postbiotic intake resulted in significant improvements in Bristol stool scale score, defecation frequency, urgency, and anxiety. Moreover, the postbiotic intervention increased beneficial intestinal bacteria, including Dysosmobacter welbionis and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, while reducing potential pathogens like Megamonas funiformis. The levels of gut Microviridae notably increased. Non‐targeted metabolomics analysis revealed postbiotic‐driven enrichment of beneficial metabolites, including α‐linolenic acid and p‐methoxycinnamic acid, and reduction of diarrhea‐associated metabolites, including theophylline, piperine, capsaicin, and phenylalanine. Targeted metabolomics confirmed a significant increase in fecal butyric acid after postbiotic intervention. The levels of aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine and tryptophan, and their related metabolites, 5‐hydroxytryptophan and kynurenine, decreased after the postbiotic intervention, suggesting diarrhea alleviation was through modulating the tryptophan‐5‐hydroxytryptamine and tryptophan‐kynurenine pathways. Additionally, chenodeoxycholic acid, a diarrhea‐linked primary bile acid, decreased substantially.

Beta‐lactams are the most commonly used antibiotics for treating DFIs. However, the use of antibiotics may lead to disruption of the healthy balance of the gut microbiota, causing dysbiosis. METHODS: Patients with infected diabetic foot ulcers (iDFUs) were treated with two kinds of beta‐lactams (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ceftazidime) according to microbial sensitivity of causative agents via bolus or continuous administration modes. Changes in the gut microbiome of patients were analyzed. Diabetic patients without iDFUs were used as a control group. 16 S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed on stool samples collected from participants. RESULTS: Alpha diversity and beta diversity of gut microbiota of treated patients did not show significant differences between bolus and continuous modes. However, significant differences were observed between gut microbiota diversity of treated patients and control group. PCoA plots showed individualized responses of the patient's gut microbiota to antibiotics at different times using both administration forms associated with the pre‐treatment state of microbiota composition. Enterococcus, Sellimonas, and Lachnoclostridium were the common bacterial markers differentially abundant in the gut microbiota of antibiotic‐treated patients with iDFUs while Roseburia, Dorea, and Monoglobus were mainly abundant in the gut microbiota of patients without iDFUs. Predicted pathways like ""Transporters"", ""ABC transporters"" and ""Phosphotranspherase system (PTS)"" were upregulated in the gut microbiome of patients treated with bolus regime which may lead to increased intestinal barrier permeability. CONCLUSION: The present study reported alterations in gut microbiota composition and functionality and provided the bacterial markers as well as potential metabolic signatures associated with each administration mode in patients with iDFUs, which may be used as a reference set for future studies of the effect of antibiotics administration on the gut microbiome of patients with iDFUs. This study shed light on the importance of understanding the effect of antibiotic administration form on gut microbiome in patients with iDFUs.

Probiotics, which colonize the bowel, are known to exert positive effects on the gut microbiota. While probiotics have been extensively studied in relation to various gastrointestinal disorders, there is limited research specifically addressing their efficacy in managing pediatric constipation. To address this gap, we designed a study to evaluate the impact of probiotics on the treatment of constipation in children attending the Imam Sajad hospital clinic in Ramsar, Iran. Materials and methods: This double‐blind clinical trial involved 90 children diagnosed with constipation, who were randomly assigned to either an intervention or a control group. For each child, a checklist was first completed, and all children received toilet training conducted by the researcher. The control group received standard treatment for constipation, which included 0.7‐1.5 grams per kilogram of Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) powder (Pidrolox). The intervention group received the same standard treatment in addition to a probiotic supplement (Kidy Lact). The study duration was four weeks and all the patients were clinically examined at two and four weeks after the intervention. The primary assessment criteria included stool consistency, the frequency of incontinence episodes per week, the presence of abdominal pain, and painful bowel movements. Secondary evaluations focused on treatment success and any adverse effects, such as diarrhea and vomiting. Results: After two weeks, no significant differences were observed between the intervention and control groups regarding stool frequency, painful defecation, incontinence, and abdominal pain (P=0.30, P=0.85, P=0.53, and P=0.23, respectively). Furthermore, after four weeks, stool frequency and incontinence did not show significant differences between the two groups (P=0.22 and P=0.53, respectively). However, the frequency of painful bowel movements in the intervention group was significantly lower than in the control group (P=0.04). Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, adding probiotics to the standard treatment for functional constipation, such as Polyethylene Glycol powder, may be beneficial for children. To obtain more precise results, it is recommended that long‐term studies be conducted using probiotics.",34,241,89‐97,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 2035658153,,,,Journal article,*constipation; *powder; Abdominal pain; Article; Checklist; Child; Clinical article; Controlled study; Diarrhea; Double blind procedure; Drug therapy; Duration; Female; Gastrointestinal disease; Human; Intestine flora; Iran; Male; Painful defecation; Randomized controlled trial; Special situation for pharmacovigilance; Toilet training; Vomiting,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02812100/full,Complementary Medicine

Infectious diseases,2024,"BACKGROUND: Management of syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection (STI) with increasing incidence, is challenged by drug shortages, scarcity of randomised trial data, an absence of non‐penicillin alternatives for pregnant women with penicillin allergy (other than desensitisation), extended parenteral administration for neurosyphilis and congenital syphilis, and macrolide resistance. Linezolid was shown to be active against Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, in vitro and in the rabbit model. We aimed to assess the efficacy of linezolid for treating early syphilis in adults compared with the standard of care benzathine penicillin G (BPG). METHODS: We did a multicentre, open‐label, non‐inferiority, randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of linezolid for treating early syphilis compared with BPG. We recruited participants with serological or molecular confirmation of syphilis (either primary, secondary, or early latent) at one STI unit in a public hospital and two STI community clinics in Catalonia (Spain). Participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio using a computer‐generated block randomisation list with six participants per block, to receive either oral linezolid (600 mg once per day for 5 days) or intramuscular BPG (single dose of 2·4 million international units) and were assessed for signs and symptoms (once per week until week 6 and at week 12, week 24, and week 48) and reagin titres of non‐treponemal antibodies (week 12, week 24, and week 48). The primary endpoint was treatment response, assessed using a composite endpoint that included clinical response, serological response, and absence of relapse. Clinical response was assessed at 2 weeks for primary syphilis and at 6 weeks for secondary syphilis following treatment initiation. Serological cure was defined as a four‐fold decline in rapid plasma reagin titre or seroreversion at any of the 12‐week, 24‐week, or 48‐week timepoints. The absence of relapse was defined as the presence of different molecular sequence types of T pallidum in recurrent syphilis. Non‐inferiority was shown if the lower limit of the two‐sided 95% CI for the difference in rates of treatment response was higher than ‐10%. The primary analysis was done in the per‐protocol population. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05069974) and was stopped for futility after interim analysis. FINDINGS: Between Oct 20, 2021, and Sept 15, 2022, 62 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 59 were randomly assigned to linezolid (n=29) or BPG (n=30). In the per‐protocol population, after 48 weeks' follow‐up, 19 (70%) of 27 participants (95% CI 49·8 to 86·2) in the linezolid group had responded to treatment and 28 (100%) of 28 participants (87·7 to 100·0) in the BPG group (treatment difference ‐29·6, 95% CI ‐50·5 to ‐8·8), which did not meet the non‐inferiority criterion. The number of drug‐related adverse events (all mild or moderate) was similar in both treatment groups (five [17%] of 29, 95% CI 5·8 to 35·8 in the linezolid group vs five [17%] of 30, 5·6 to 34·7, in the BPG group). No serious adverse events were reported during follow‐up. INTERPRETATION: The efficacy of linezolid at a daily dose of 600 mg for 5 days did not meet the non‐inferiority criteria compared with BPG and, as a result, this treatment regimen should not be used to treat patients with early syphilis.

CN-02340863,"NCT05052775,",EFFICACY OF MORUS ALBA FRUIT EXTRACTS AND CHLORHEXIDINE ON SALIVARY STREPTOCOCCUS MUTANS AND pH LEVELS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT05052775,2021,"INTRODUCTION Streptococcus mutans is the major pathogen involved in the development of dental caries. This is an anaerobic gram positive coccus, naturally present in the oral microbiota and can easily colonize on the tooth surface and initiates production of acid by combining extracellular polysaccharide that results in demineralization of tooth and development of dental caries (Shah et al., 2018). The quantity of colonized surfaces is associated with streptococcus mutans in the saliva. Thus, by decreasing the concentration of Streptococcus mutans in the mouth cavity would have a significant advantage in reducing the occurrence of cariogenic microbes. (Lemos et al., 2019, Forssten et al., 2010, Banas and Drake., 2018) Dental caries is a microbial disease of the oral cavity, which is identified by demineralization of the inorganic substances and dissolution of the organic substances of the teeth. Dental caries has been recognized throughout history and exists around the world, reported to be 44%, but the severity and prevalence changes in different countries (J.V Soames and J.C Southam et al., 2018). In our neighboring countries, the frequency of dental caries is quite high, documented to be 68%, 65% and 64% in China, Iran and India respectively. The prevalence of dental caries in Pakistan is also quite high, around 62%, which is associated with significant morbidity and economic consequences (Reddy K S, et al., 2017, Lu Liu et al., 2013) Dental caries basically involves contact between the tooth structure, the sugars and biofilm formed on the tooth surfaces (Pitts, N. B et al., 2016). The caries process composed of altering periods of demineralization and remineralization of tooth, which, if net demineralization happens over adequate time, results in the initiation of dental caries. The cause of dental caries is lactic acid produced by fermentation of sugars by oral bacteria (Banas and Drake., 2018). The normal pH level of saliva is 6.2‐ 7.6. At neutral pH, calcium and phosphate ions from the saliva incorporate into the enamel and maintain the structure of enamel, but when the pH level falls below normal, i.e. at 5.5 or below 5.5, the calcium and phosphate ions from the enamel leach out and causes the exchange of minerals ions from hydroxyapatite crystals of enamel into plaque, resulting in demineralization of tooth (J.V Soames Oral pathology 2018). Dental caries management emphasizes on reducing tooth demineralization by changing eating habits, altering or inhibiting bacterial growth, changing the salivary pH level and buffering capacity (Khirtika et al., 2017, Velmurugan et al., 2013, Yang et al., 2018). Different antimicrobial synthetic mouthwashes, toothpastes, gels, chewing gums and varnishes have been used to improve mouth hygiene and prevent dental caries by aiming cariogenic microorganisms. The prevention of dental caries is done by mouth brushing after meal, by using fluoride toothpastes, antimicrobial mouthwashes, interdental cleaning aids, salivary stimulants (xylitol, mannitol), pit and fissure sealants, and application of topical fluoride on teeth surfaces. Mouth rinses also reduce gingival inflammation and inhibit plaque formation (Velmurugan et al., 2013, Chen and Wang, 2010, Zajkani et al., 2018). Mouthwashes have anticariogenic effects, but have certain disadvantages. They are costly, have side effects including staining of the teeth and burning sensation in the oral cavity (Nayak et al., 2012, Aoun et al., 2018). Chlorhexidine is gold standard, commonly used and most effective chemical approach to decrease the accumulation of plaque. Daily rinsing mouth with chlorhexidine (0.2%) has been shown to reduce the growth rate of streptococcus mutans in the oral cavity (Velmurugan et al., 2013). However, it has certain side effects, i.e. oral mucosal erosion, parotid swelling, staining of teeth, burning feeling and bitter taste. (Jacob and Nivedhitha, 2018b, Shah et al., 2018, Van der Weijden et al., 2010, Nayak et al., 2012, Solderer et al., 2019) Many populations use medicinal plants as traditional or alternative treatments for various ailments due to their better safety profiles, health beneficial effects, lower cost and easy availability. Among the plant species used for medicinal purposes are those of the genus Morus, includes most commonly used species are Morus alba, rubra and nigra, that have also shown antimicrobial properties against various life threatening infections (Ercisli S et al., 2006). Morus alba commonly called as white mulberry, and it belongs to family Moraceae is otherwise called Tut, shahtoot or mulberry. Morus Alba (white mulberry) is native to China, India, Pakistan and Japan (Kumar V et al., 2008). In the current study, Morus alba fruit extract will be compared with chlorhexidine to Streptococcus mutans against oral pathogens due to its antimicrobial properties. Statement of the problem Dental caries is highly prevalent across the globe including Pakistan; it causes tooth loss, malocclusion, and temporomandibular joint problems. The associated infections may carry risk of spreading into superficial and deep fascial spaces and, even may cause life threatening infections. Treatment of dental caries is quite expensive and poses an economic burden on our already deprived low socioeconomic population. So, there is need of exploration of natural products that may have antimicrobial and other beneficial effects to decrease the caries activity along with good safety profiles, easily available and cost‐effective. Research question Are the aqueous extracts of Morus alba fruit equally effective as chlorhexidine mouthwash for the prevention of dental caries? Objectives To compare the efficacy of Morus alba fruit extracts with chlorhexidine in patients having dental caries on the basis of reduction in counts of Streptococcus mutans in their saliva. To compare the efficacy of Morus alba fruit extracts with chlorhexidine in patients having dental caries on the basis of increase in their salivary pH levels. Rationale Chlorhexidine is a chemical, having bitter taste and cause burning sensation in the oral cavity and may not be feasible for the patients due to cosmetic reasons. Mouthwash derived from herbal products, having antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens might provide economical and safe treatment option to reduce the burden of dental caries in our clinical set‐up. To the best of our knowledge, the mulberry fruit extract has not been evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens including Streptococcus mutans. Hypothesis Null hypothesis: Ho: Aqueous extracts of Morus alba fruit are not equally effective as chlorhexidine mouthwash for the prevention of dental caries. Alternate Hypothesis: Ha: Aqueous extracts of Morus alba fruit are equally effective as chlorhexidine mouthwash for the prevention of dental caries. REVIEW OF LITERATURE Dental caries consists of connections between the tooth structures, sugars, and the microbial biofilm on the tooth surfaces (Pitts, N. B et al., 2016). Streptococcus mutans and salivary pH are the two main factors that cause dental caries and therefore targeting them can be an efficient route to tackle this global disease. Chlorhexidine is an excellent antimicrobial agent and considered as boon for maintaining oral health and hygiene. Similarly, many herbal agents has been introduced which are as effective as chlorhexidine. (Sajjan et al., 2016, Ahmed et al., 2017, Jacob and Nivedhitha, 2018, Carounanidy et al., 2007, Esther et al., 2017) Medicinal plants have been used by many populations as a therapeutic agent because of their easy availability, safe and cost effectiveness. The morus species also have medicinal properties and have been used as antidiabetic, neuroprotective, hypolipidimic and as laxatives (Anna Gryn‐Rynko et al., 2016). More than 100 species of morus are present all over the world and in Pakistan there are 25 morus species available. The most common morus species are Morus alba, rubra and nigra (Imran M., Khan H., et al., 2010). Morus alba fruit contains many active substances, such as flavonols, polyphenols, alkaloids and polysaccharides (Gundogdu M et al., 2011). Morus alba is the rich source of Vitamin A, Vitamin B1, Folic acid, Vitamin C, Minerals, Carbohydrates, Amino acids, Fatty acids, anthocyanin and saponins (Jiang Y et al., 2015). In conventional Chinese natural medication, mulberry fruit have been utilized in people drugs to treat diabetes, hypertension, anemia, and joint pain. Morus alba has been known for its antidiabetic, antihelmintic, antimicrobial, anxiolytic, hepatoprotective and nephroprotective properties (Wang, J.; et al., 2013, Yang, X. L et al., 2010, Khalid, S et al., 2017). The Morus fruit, although from the same species, that may contain different antioxidant properties as well as different chemical composition. The mineral elements in Morus alba include potassium (K), sodium (Na), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), magnesium (Mg), chromium (Cr), and arsenic (As) (Liang, L et al., 2012). The methanolic extract of the bark of Morus alba and its constituents are used as antimicrobial agents (Kuete, et al., 2009). The antimicrobial agent ""kuwanon G"" obtained from bark of the root of Morus alba has indicated activity against Streptococcus mutans at a MIC of 8.0 μg/ml. The bactericidal test of kuwanon G indicated that it totally inactivated Streptococcus mutans at the concentration 20 μg/ml in 60 seconds (Park, K. M et al., 2002). According to Jha et al, he assessed the antimicrobial activity of Morus alba leaves (aqueous extract) on gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis), and gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli). Results of the antimicrobial activity confirmed that Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were most susceptible bacterial species to crude extract, showed the MIC value at concentration from 0.2‐26mg/mL (S. Jha, A.K et al., 2013). The antimicrobial activity of 1‐deoxynojirmiycin (component of Morus alba leaves) and crude ethanolic extract of Morus alba leaves were assessed. Both the 1‐deoxynojirmiycin and morus alba leaves (crude extract) showed strong bacteriostatic activity against Streptococcus mutans, but the 1‐deoxynojirmiycin showed lower MIC value (15.6mg/ml) than the crude extract of Morus alba (125mg/mg/mL) ( B. Islam., et al 2008). The ethanolic extract of Morus alba leaves showed antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida krusei, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus and Candida tropicalis (Oliveira et al., 2015). Anthocyanins are the most significant constituent of Morus alba fruit, which are phenolic compounds that are responsible for many biological activities such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and anti‐inflammatory properties (Liu LK et al., 2008). The cyanidin‐3‐glucoside and cyanidin‐3‐rutinoside are the main anthocyanins separated from mulberry fruit (Suh H.J et al 2003, Liu X.et al 2004). The active ingredient of Morus alba is anthocyanin and anthocyanin present in the fruit of Morus species displayed antibacterial activities against E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus (Chen H., et al 2017). The proposed mechanisms by which anthocyanin produces antimicrobial effects include action on the cell membrane of pathogen with the leakage of its nucleic acid and proteins (Bajpai et al., 2013). Anthocyanin causes inhibition of microbial superoxide dismutase, alkaline phosphatase and ATP production with subsequent inhibition of TCA cycle (Li et al., 2010).All these mechanisms results in the lysis of pathogenic cell. Shumaila Naz et al confirmed the antimicrobial activity of Mulberry fruit extracts against water‐ borne microbial pathogens (Listeria monocytogene, Salmonella enteric, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella pneumophila, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus mirabilis, Clostridium sp., Serratia sp., Aeromonas hydrophila , Corneybacterium sp., Bacillus subtilis, , E. coli, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Actinomyces sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholera, Salmonella typhi, Bacillus anthracis and Streptococcus pneumonia) isolated from different water samples. The results indicated that mulberry fruit extracts are effective against water‐borne microbial pathogens (Shumaila Naz et al., 2018). SAFETY PROFILES OF MORUS ALBA The intragastric administration of Morus alba extract in rats for the duration of 7 days at the maximum dose of 1gm/kg didn't produce toxic effects (Jiao Y et al., 2017). A study conducted on rats in which the effects of ethanolic extracts of Morus alba in rats at the dose of 250mg/kg for 2 weeks of administration did not cause toxic effects (Hwang et al., 2016). Another study conducted on rats that were fed with anthocyanins derived from mulberry fruit. The anthocyanins decreased the raised levels aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase ALT in rats. (Hepatoprotective effects) SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION The sample size was estimated using Open Epi sample size calculator by considering the following statistics; Change in pH level (Chlorhexidine) = 6.88±0.20 (Velmurugan et al., 2013) and considering 20% difference in pH for mulberry extracts as 8.256±0.24 Power of test= 90% Confidence level= 95% The calculated sample size came out as 1 in each group. However, I will include 120 patients having 40 patients in each group according to normality assumption. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Study setting This study will be conducted at the department of Dentistry, Civil hospital Uthal, district Lasbella and at the department of Plant Pathology, Lasbella University of Agriculture, Water and Marines Sciences (LUAWMS) Balochistan. Study design Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial It's a double blinded study, in which both researcher and the patient will be blinded to keep the results unbiased. However, the co‐investigator will know either the patient is receiving gold standard or herbal mouthwash.

Exclusion criteria The patients undergoing orthodontic treatment The patients already taking antibiotic therapy or antimicrobial rinse. The patients having allergy to chlorhexidine mouthwash The patients whose consents could not be obtained MATERIALS AND METHOD MATERIALS USED IN STUDY The materials used in the study will be Chlorhexidine mouthwash, Morus alba fruit, pH meter, selective agar and culture plates for Streptococcus mutans, test tubes and saliva collections kits. MORUS ALBA COLLECTION Morus alba (White Mulberry) fruit will be obtained from an authentic herbal store and the Morus alba fruit will be authenticated from Botany department of LUAWMS. PREPARATION OF AQUEOUS EXTRACT OF MORUS ALBA FRUIT The preparation will be done in the department of Plant Pathology LUAWMS. Morus alba fruit will be washed with distilled water and will be allowed to dry. Then the fruit material (Morus alba) will be grinded with help of mortar and pestle. For 20% aqueous preparation, 100ml distilled water will be added to 20g grinded powder and will be incubated in shaking incubator for 8 hours. (For 30% aqueous preparation, 100ml distilled water will be added to 30g grinded powder). Aqueous extracts will be filtered through Watman No. 1 (Schuell and Schleicher 125 mm Cat No. 1001 125) filter paper (Shumaila naz et al., 2018). STANDARDIZATION OF PARTICIPANTS The subjects selected according to inclusion criteria will be standardized. The participants will be advised to brush their teeth twice a day (after breakfast in the morning and at bed time), and to avoid junk foods. Participants will be advised to take sugary drinks (tea, coffee, sweetened beverage) not more than 2 times a day. These Instructions will also be given to participants in written form. The participants will be instructed to act upon this guidance and will be called after 1 week for baseline salivary samples. DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURE A total of 120 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Informed consents will be taken from all the participants. While taking consent, the patients will be informed that they will receive either gold standard (chlorhexidine) or herbal mouthwash. The selection of patients either in group A, B or C will be done by Random Number Table method. The labeling of group as A, B and C will be done by co‐investigator. List of groups will be sealed in opaque envelop and will opened when study will be completed. STUDY GROUPS A total of 120 participants will be included in the study. The participants will be equally divided into three groups (group A, B and C). The participants in group A will be given Chlorhexidine mouthwash and the participants in the group B and C will be given 20% and 30% aqueous extract of Morus alba fruit respectively. SALIVARY pH ANALYSIS The salivary pH level analysis will be done using pH meter and the salivary pH will be recorded at baseline and 15 days after the use of respective mouthwash. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE The 5ml baseline unstimulated salivary samples will be taken from the participants by Passive drooling technique, then 3ml will be used for measurement of salivary pH and the remaining salivary sample will be stored at 0 C, and then will be transferred to lab for the assessment of Streptococcus mutans. After baseline salivary samples taken, participants will be asked to rinse and hold 10ml of respective mouthwash for the duration of 30 seconds in their mouth before spitting it. The procedure will be repeated by the participants, twice a day for 15 days. After 15 days, salivary samples will be taken again from participants for assessment of Streptococcus mutans and the results obtained will be compared with baseline salivary samples for Streptococcus mutans. CULTURE PROCEDURE The technique for assessing the microbial content will be dilution and spread plate method. Salivary microbial analysis will be done by diluting each salivary sample 1:10 ratio in distilled water. Each sample will be then streak into plate having Mitis salivarius agar media (MSA). Plates will be then incubated for 48 hours at 37°C and the number of Streptococcus mutans colonies (CFU) will be counted under self‐illuminating binocular microscope. All findings will be recorded in pre‐designed proforma. (Smariti sexena et al,. 2017, Velmurugan et al,. 2013, Hongkun Wu et al., 2003) STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data will be analyzed using SPSS version 23. Mean and Standard deviation will be taken for numerical data. Frequency and percentages will be taken for categorical data. Paired‐t test will be done for comparison between pre and post intervention values of bacterial counts and pH values for each group and the ANOVA with post hoc Tukey's test will be applied for comparison between three groups. P < 0.05 will be considered as statistically significant. ETHICAL CONSIDERATION Ethical approval will be taken from the Ethics Committee of Ziauddin University. Informed Consent will be obtained from each subject before recording of any measurement. All information gathered from the study will be kept strictly confidential. Anonymity of all subjects will be maintained by careful storage of information. If any dental related problems will be noticed, then the patients will be informed and referred to the relevant clinics for necessary treatment. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY If the results of our study prove Morus alba to be more effective, then being derived from natural source, a safe , low cost and eco‐friendly agent will be available in future for the prevention of dental caries.

Few studies have been conducted in low‐income settings where childhood malnutrition is common and possibly related to microbiota composition. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether gut microbiota composition in young children and their mothers is associated with different environmental exposures in rural Malawi. We hypothesized that more adverse environmental exposures would be associated with lower levels of microbiota maturity and diversity. METHODS: Faecal samples from up to 631 children and mothers participating in a nutrition intervention trial were collected at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 30 months (children) and at 1 month (mothers) after birth and analysed for microbiota composition with 16S rRNA sequencing. Bacterial OTU and genus abundances, measures of microbiota maturity and diversity, and UniFrac distances were compared between participants with different environmental exposures. The exposure variables included socio‐economic status, water source, sanitary facility, domestic animals, maternal characteristics, season, antibiotic use, and delivery mode. RESULTS: Measures of microbiota maturity and diversity in children were inversely associated with maternal education at 6, 18, and 30 months and did not otherwise differ consistently between participants with different environmental exposures. Phylogenetic distance was related to season of stool sample collection at all time points. At the level of individual OTUs and genera, season of stool sample collection, type of water source, and maternal education showed most associations with child gut microbiota, while HIV status was the most important predictor of relative OTU and genus abundances in mothers. CONCLUSION: The results do not support the hypothesis that adverse environmental exposures are broadly associated with lower microbiota maturity and diversity but suggest that environmental exposures influence the abundance of several bacterial OTUs and genera and that low maternal education is associated with higher microbiota maturity and diversity.",34,2,161‐170,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 32011017,,,,,Journal article,"Adult; Bacteria [classification, isolation & purification]; Child Nutrition Disorders [diagnosis, epidemiology]; Child, Preschool; Educational Status; Environmental Exposure [analysis, statistics & numerical data]; Feces [*microbiology]; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome [*physiology]; HIV Infections [diagnosis, epidemiology]; Humans; Infant; Infant Nutrition Disorders [diagnosis, epidemiology]; Malawi [epidemiology]; Male; Nutrition Assessment; Nutritional Support; Socioeconomic Factors",10.1111/ppe.12623,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02248945/full,

Exclusion criteria: Pregnant females. Females who were breast feeding. Children <5 years of age. Patients who had terminal illness or who were sick because of other comorbidities. History of hypersensitivity to albendazole, mebendazole, pyrantel pamoate or ivermectin. The present study was a randomized single blinded trial. A total of 400 patients including children, adolescents and elderly, who were infected with Ascaris lumbricoides and met the inclusion criteria were recruited. Four groups each comprising of 100 patients were randomly allocated to receive albendazole, mebendazole, pyrantel pamoate and ivermectin. Primary Outcome: Cure rate (CR) which means the percentage of patients who became egg‐negative after treatment and egg reduction rate (ERR) which indicated reduction in the geometric mean fecal egg count on follow‐up compared to base line at 21‐23 days post‐treatment was used as a primary outcome measure. Adverse events were monitored 3 hours post treatment. From each patient, two stool samples were examined for the presence and number of A. lumbricoides eggs. The patients were randomly assigned to albendazole, mebendazole, pyrantel pamoate and ivermectin. Three weeks later two more stool samples were analyzed for A. lumbricoides eggs. The stool was examined for ova of Ascariasis. Stool examination for ova of A. lumbricoides was done by two methods: Direct Smear method Concentration method Worm Load Stool for worm load was done by Stoll’s Egg‐ Counting Technique. In our study, the subjects were recruited from outpatient, inpatient, schools, villages and far‐flung areas. Potential risks and benefits were explained to all subjects. An informed consent form was distributed to all subjects and their consent was sought. In addition a questionnaire was administered to each participating subject for obtaining sociodemographic data including sex, age, residence, level of education, occupation, ethnic group, sanitation infrastructure and behavioral data (wearing of shoes, source of drinking water, food consumption and personal hygiene). Patients were grouped as per the socio‐economic status into high, middle and low income groups. This classification was based on modified B. G Prasad’s classification (2013) RESULTS: Helminthis infect 25‐30% of world’s population. Common intestinal helminthic infection presents important health problem in the school‐age population. Of the infected children, majority had Ascariasis with worm load of light, moderate and heavy intensity. This finding has important implications for morbidity and transmission rates. The periodic administration of antihelmintic drugs to at‐risk population is the global strategy for controlling morbidity due to soil‐transmitted helminthic infection. The goal of control program is to eliminate childhood illness caused by soil‐transmitted helminthic infection, i.e., to decrease the prevalence of moderate and heavy infection intensity among school‐age children to less than 1%. The population of the developing countries across the globe suffers not only as a direct result of these infections but also due to comorbidity such as anemia, malnutrition and reduced immunity status. It has been seen that well targeted drug delivery, particularly via community chemotherapy, can substantially decrease aggregate morbidity and mortality and also improve growth rates, physical fitness and activity, cognitive school performance, and social well being. Improvement in appetite is likely to be the single most important mechanism through which a variety of physiological improvement occurs.Lastly, to conclude, large scale treatment and control of helminthes and treatment of individual cases when diagnosed are now truly urgent.",9,7,9233‐9250,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 2022161471,,,,Journal article,*antihelminthic therapy; *helminthiasis /drug therapy; Academic achievement; Adolescent; Adult; Adverse outcome; Anemia; Article; Ascariasis; Ascaris lumbricoides; Child; Drug efficacy; Educational status; Fecal egg count; Feces analysis; Female; Fitness; Follow up; Growth rate; Human; Income; Jaundice; Major clinical study; Male; Malnutrition; Morbidity; Physical activity; Prevalence; Sanitation; Security; Smear; Social status; Social well‐being; Treatment duration; Worm burden,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02515614/full,

So, it seems that the modulation of intestinal microbial ecology by pro‐/pre‐/synbiotics may contribute to the progression and prevention of metabolic diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of probiotics and synbiotic supplementation on the modification of the intestinal microbiome in adults with prediabetes. Methods: In a randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled clinical trial, 120 patients with prediabetes were randomly assigned to consume 6 g/d of either a placebo containing maltodextrin (control) or multispecies probiotic or inulin‐based synbiotic for 6 mo. Fecal samples were obtained at baseline and after 6 mo of supplementation. Dietary intake was assessed throughout the study (at baseline and after 3 and 6 mo). Total energy, macronutrients, and dietary fiber were calculated using a dietary program Nutritionist 4. DNA was extracted from fecal samples and the numbers of Clostridium perfringens (the represent of phylum Firmicutes), Bacteroides fragilis (the representative of Bacteroidetes) and Escherichia coli (as universal bacteria) were determined by quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR). The changes in the relative abundance of the two fecal bacteria before and after supplementation were analyzed and compared within and between groups. Results: There were no significant changes in dietary intake during the study. Six mo of supplementation with probiotics resulted in a statistically significant increase in the abundance of the B. fragilis‐to‐E.coli ratio (mean difference [MD] ± SE 0.47 ± 0.37, P = 0.04) and decrease of the relative proportion of Firmicutes‐to‐Bacteroidetes representatives (MD ± SE –118.8 ± 114.6, P = 0.02). Synbiotic had no significant effect on the changes in the bacteria. There were no significant differences between the three groups.

However, in some areas a decade or more of treatment has not controlled infection. Here, we compared multiple treatment arms from a community‐randomized trial to evaluate whether increasing frequency of azithromycin distribution decreases prevalence in the short term. METHODS: Seventy‐two communities in Goncha Siso Enesie woreda in the Amhara region of Northern Ethiopia were randomized to 1 of 6 azithromycin distribution strategies: (1) delayed, (2) annual, (3) biannual, (4) quarterly to children only, (5) biennial, or (6) biennial plus latrine promotion. We analyzed data from the 60 communities in the delayed, annual, biannual, quarterly, and biennial distribution arms at the 12‐month study visit. Communities in the annual and biennial distribution arm were combined, as they each had a single distribution before any 12‐month retreatment. We assessed the effect of increased frequency of azithromycin distribution on ocular chlamydia prevalence. RESULTS: Ocular chlamydia prevalence was significantly different across azithromycin distribution frequency in children (P < .0001) and adults (P < .0001), with lower prevalence associated with higher frequency. Among children, quarterly azithromycin distribution led to a significantly greater reduction in ocular chlamydia prevalence than the World Health Organization‐recommended annual treatment prevalence (mean difference ‐11.4%, 95% confidence interval ‐19.5 to ‐3.3%, P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Increased frequency of azithromycin distribution leads to decreased ocular chlamydia prevalence over a short‐term period.

Rotavirus, a major factor in viral diarrhea among children aged 6 months to 2 years, presents with severe symptoms such as watery diarrhea and vomiting. Although mortality rates have decreased due to supportive care and vaccines, promising alternatives like N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) show potential benefits in laboratory studies, indicating a possible supplementary strategy for managing rotavirus infections by reducing the duration and antigen excretion in feces. METHODS: During this double‐blind clinical trial, 71 patients, confirmed to have gastroenteritis resulting from rotavirus using a rapid diagnostic strip, were randomly allocated to two groups. One group was prescribed NAC at a dosage of 60 mg/kg/day, while the other received a placebo. The patient's progress was monitored daily until their gastroenteritis improved, and details regarding the duration of diarrhea and the frequency of bowel movements were recorded for each participant. RESULTS: The average duration of diarrhea in the NAC group and the placebo group was 2 and 3 days, respectively, with a level of p = 0.121. During the diarrhea period, the number of bowel movements in the NAC group was recorded at 28.1 ± 21.6 times, whereas in the placebo group, it was 35.3 ± 33.1 times, yielding a p‐value of 0.409. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the effects of NAC were observed in lowering the duration of the period and decreasing the frequency of bowel movements in gastroenteritis, these results did not reach statistical significance. Hence, the data from this study suggest that NAC may not effectively reduce the duration of diarrhea and the frequency of bowel movements linked to gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus.

Previous studies show that probiotics and proton‐pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 blockers could control diarrhea associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). This study aims to determine and compare the efficacy of a short course of oral ranitidine and a probiotic in the treatment of toddler's diarrhea. Methods: This study was a parallel‐group randomized controlled trial (RCT). We sequentially enrolled 40 patients who met the eligibility criteria. We randomly assigned 20 patients to the oral ranitidine group, ten patients to the probiotic group, and ten patients to the placebo group. In the oral ranitidine group, patients received oral ranitidine (3 mg/kg/day) once daily for 10 days; in the probiotic and placebo groups, they were administered 5 to 10 billion colony‐forming units (CFUs) per day of lyophilized Lactobacillus rhamnosus and 50 mg of once‐daily oral vitamin C tablet respectively for 10 days. Stool frequency and consistency on the 10th day of the interventions were recorded as the primary outcomes. We used the Student's t‐test to determine if there were significant differences in the mean daily stool frequencies in the three intervention groups. A p‐value < 0.05 was adopted as the level of statistical significance. Results: In the ranitidine group, stool frequency decreased significantly from an average of five per day on the first day to an average of approximately one per day on the 10th day of intervention (t = 10.462, p < 0.001). Additionally, stool consistency normalized on the 10th day of intervention. In the probiotic group, there was a significant reduction in stool frequency from an average of five per day on the first day to four per day on the 10th day (t = 2.586, p = 0.041), although stool consistency remained loose. However, stool consistency and frequency were not significantly affected in the placebo group (t = 1.964, p = 0.072). Conclusion: Oral ranitidine is more effective than probiotics in reducing stool frequency and normalizing stool consistency in toddler's diarrhea.

Determinants ofstunted growth and development are multi‐factorial, including interactions betweenbiological, behavioral, social, and environmental conditions, yet the evidence‐base isminimal for integrated approaches to tackle the interwoven factors. Our group recentlyfound significant impacts from an egg intervention on young child growth and biomarkersof nutrition and brain development. The effects on important psychosocial indicators ofchild development, however, were not assessed. Building on these findings and those ofour pilot study of a group‐based, multicomponent intervention (Grandi Byen, HaitianCreole for ""grow well""), this randomized controlled trial (RCT) seeks to examine agreater breadth of egg intervention outcomes, the synergistic effects of addingpsychoeducational parenting to the egg intervention, and mediating biological, behavioraland social factors.The 3‐arm longitudinal RCT will be carried out in Cap‐Haitien, Haiti, where our group hasa decade of research experience, established partnerships, and a strong researchinfrastructure. It is representative of resource‐poor urban contexts globally, whereparents face common economic and environmental challenges to child growth anddevelopment. The trial will compare the following groups for effectiveness in reducingyoung child stunted growth and enhancing overall development: 1) standard well‐baby care,(n=200); 2) nutrition intervention (one egg per day for 6 months), (n=200); and 3)multicomponent Grandi Byen intervention (responsive parenting, nutrition, hygiene + oneegg per day for 6 months), (n=200). Infants will be enrolled between 6‐8 months of ageand followed longitudinally for one year.The specific aims of this project are:Aim 1 (primary): To demonstrate the reproducibility and feasibility of egg‐basedinterventions in reducing childhood stunting, and test its impact on development.Hypothesis 1: Linear growth will be increased by 0.30 LAZ in children receiving one eggper day compared to standard care. Hypothesis 2: Children receiving the egg interventionwill have better cognitive, motor and language development compared to standard care.Question 1 (exploratory): Does an egg‐based intervention impact social‐emotionaldevelopment?Aim 2 (primary): To investigate the incremental benefit of Grandi Byen compared to eggonly and standard care groups on primary outcomes of child growth and development.Hypothesis 3: Children of mothers receiving Grandi Byen will increase linear growth by0.10 LAZ compared to the egg intervention. Hypothesis 4: Children of mothers receivingGrandi Byen will have higher scores on child cognition, language, motor, andsocio‐emotional development, with an effect size of 0.36 on cognition, compared tostandard care. An economic evaluation will be conducted to compare the efficiency of theinterventions.Aim 3 (secondary).

To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the drug Viferon®, rectal suppositories (RS) in the complex therapy of viral meningitis (VM) based on the dynamics of clinical and laboratory parameters in children. Patients and methods. A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the drug Viferon® (recombinant interferon α‐2b) in the complex therapy of VM in children. The study included 140 children from 2 to 18 years old, who made up two groups: group 1 (n = 70) received CP Viferon® in age doses: up to 3 years – 500.000 IU; from 4 to 11 years – 1.000.000 IU; from 12 to 18 years – 3.000.000 IU each. Viferon® was prescribed 1 suppository 2 times a day for 7 days, then 1 time a day for 7 days. The 2nd group (n = 70) consisted of children with VM who received placebo, RS according to the scheme of the Viferon®.The children were randomized by gender, age, weight and severity of the VM. The effectiveness of therapy was evaluated based on the duration of clinical symptoms, the dynamics of pleocytosis and rehabilitation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on day 15, the frequency of complete recovery on day 15, after 1, 3 and 6 months. The safety of using of the Viferon® was assessed according to the state of clinical and laboratory parameters, frequency and severity of adverse events. Results. The etiology of VM was determined in 64.3% of cases (n = 90) and included herpes viruses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 type, enteroviruses, tick‐borne encephalitis virus. It was found that children of group 1 had significantly shorter duration of meningeal, cerebral and intoxication syndromes, approximately 2 times less pleocytosis on day 15 and CSF sanitation from viruses in all cases, unlike patients of group 2 (p < 0.001). The differences with group 2 were also significant in age subgroups. Patients receiving the Viferon® were more likely to achieve complete clinical recovery on day 15 and did not have a residual deficiency in the outcome in 100% of cases after 3 months. The use of the Viferon® turned out to be safe, did not increase the incidence of the adverse events compared with the 2nd group of children receiving placebo. Conclusion. The use of the Viferon® in children with VM according to the scheme developed by the authors significantly reduces the regression of inflammatory changes and the timing of CSF rehabilitation, the duration of the main clinical symptoms compared with the placebo group, leads to recovery in 100% of cases.",21,4,49‐58,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 2028175969,,,,Journal article,*drug safety; *virus meningitis /diagnosis /drug therapy /etiology; Adolescent; Article; Cerebrospinal fluid; Child; Controlled study; Disease duration; Double blind procedure; Human; Infant; Laboratory test; Major clinical study; Outcome assessment; Pleocytosis /side effect; Randomized controlled trial; Tick borne encephalitis virus,10.20953/1729-9225-2023-4-49-58,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02666755/full,

IBS affects 7‐15% of the general population(6, 7). It is twice as frequent in women(8) and is diagnosed more often in patients less than 50 years of age(9). It is characterized by recurrent episodes of functional gastrointestinal symptoms whose pathophysiological mechanisms are not completely clear(10). The most common symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and/or diarrhea(10). IBS negatively impacts quality of life and causes a substantial burden on healthcare resources(11, 12). Like the clinical phenotypes, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the syndrome are heterogeneous and not fully understood(13). However, there is evidence that IBS may result from a combination of gastrointestinal motility changes, visceral hypersensitivity, low‐grade inflammation, altered microbiota, and food components(14‐17). Due to the diversity of IBS symptoms and their considerable variability over time, a wide range of pharmacological treatments are employed which often only target the primary symptom; thus, when multiple symptoms are present, the treatments administered are often inadequate. This has led to the investigation of use of dietary therapies as a treatment option. Dietary restriction of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) have been recently investigated in the management of functional gut symptoms in IBS. An increasing number of uncontrolled and controlled trials have examined the clinical effectiveness of a low FODMAP diet in patients with IBS using either dietary advice or feeding protocols. Uncontrolled and unblinded controlled trials suggest symptom response rates in patients with IBS are as high as 85%(18). Similarly, a beneficial impact on symptoms has been reported in blinded randomized controlled trials(19‐22). A potential shortcoming of the low FODMAP diet and of any diet that involves multiple food exclusion, is the risk of nutritional inadequacy, and this is especially pertinent if the excluded foods are nutrient‐rich. The low FODMAP diet requires substitution of selected food items across a number of food groups and, therefore, there is the potential for inadequate intake of nutrients, particularly carbohydrate, fiber, iron, B vitamins, and calcium. Another potential safety concern associated with implementation of the diet relates to the impact on the gastrointestinal microbiota, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBS(23) and has been associated with clinical features of IBS including abdominal pain, anxiety, and depression(24, 25). Hence, we propose to evaluate the microbiome and metabolome in IBS patients to create datasets of integrated data through AI tools. Furthermore, we aim to determine the effects of a low FOODMAP diet based on fermented products on the microbiome and metabolome in IBS patients. These evaluations will allow to assess patient's nutrient deficiency and the general quality of life pre and post intervention among groups and to develop a personalized treatment that will increase the quality of life in IBS patients. The low FODMAPs diet is associated with limitations particularly due to the elimination of several food items which can cause worsening of the side effects due to significant alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition and an overall reduction of the nutritional status. Although, probiotics seem to have beneficial effects on improving this side effect, their way of function is still relatively unknown. Much remains to be answered as to which strains is/are most effective across the broad spectrum of IBS patients and whether single or combination of strains work best. This leads to the question of whether individual differences among IBS patients in terms of microbiome diversity could affect the efficacy of probiotics therapy. Therefore, with our approach we propose a reshaping of the host‐microbiota interactions through personalized nutrition which could be a new therapeutic avenue for both disease control and prevention. Specifically, we believe that a diet supplemented with previously fermented food items will be beneficial for the patient's condition. This fermentation will be controlled and performed with Lactobacillus paracasei strain CNCM I‐5220. Through the longitudinal study we will be able to evaluate their grade of the disorder at baseline (one week of low FODMAP diet), and the effect of the fermented food items on their microbiota and metabolome after one and two weeks. Furthermore, by adopting new efficacious treatment options, it might be possible to decrease the high recurrence rate of IBS patients to the public health system, improving patient's quality of life and decreasing the costs for the National Sanitary System (SSN). The primary objective will be to assess the enterotypes of IBS patient at baseline and to analyze how supplementation of fermented food modifies the microbiome and metabolome in IBS patients following a low FODMAP diet. As secondary objective, we will compare the efficacy and safety of two different nutritional approaches on IBS symptoms.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT06420843,,,Trial registry record,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02702200/full,

In low socioeconomic countries, tablets are typically crushed, dispersed in water, and administered as a suspension to the child. This practice introduces several points of failure, including unpalatability leading to refusal of the drug and lack of clean water for resuspension. Thus, there remains a critical need to develop dosage forms that do not require crushing and suspension. The investigators have developed a formulation inspired by techniques recently described in the field of molecular gastronomy that transform oils into gels, also known as ""oleogels"". Oils have a prolonged history of use in the food industry, and a very well‐established safety profile. Plant‐derived oils represent an attractive vehicle for drug delivery. Many drugs have hydrophobic properties and therefore have a greater wettability and solubility in oil in comparison to water. Ingestion of fats stimulates secretion of bile salts and enzymes that enhance drug dissolution in the physiological fluids and drug absorption. Furthermore, converting oils into gels allows for altering the mouth‐feel and texture of the dosage form, which affects patient acceptance. The aim of this exploratory study is to determine azithromycin bioavailability of oral and rectal oleogels in healthy volunteers as well as to make an initial safety evaluation of the oleogels. The reference azithromycin tablet has a bioavailability of 38%, with an AUC of 4.3 mcg*hr/ml, Cmax 0.5 mcg/ml, and Tmax of 2.2 hours. The half‐life is approximately 68 hours. The safety profile of azithromycin has been well characterized and single doses of azithromycin are well tolerated, with common reactions including diarrhea/loose stools, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, dyspepsia, and vaginitis (all less than 10% of subjects in studies). The intersubject variability of the pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter estimates for the azithromycin oleogel are derived from our preclinical studies of the azithromycin oleogel in swine; the coefficient of variation for both the oral tablets, oral oleogels, and rectal oleogels are between 30‐40%. These estimates of intersubject variability informed our number of subjects, (N=21), for this crossover study. Additional coefficient of variability estimates for oral tablets were found in the literature and were approximately 30%. Azithromycin is not approved for rectal administration. However, our own studies of the rectal azithromycin oleogel in female Yorkshire swine at doses of 5 mg/kg (40‐70 kg weight range) found the following pharmacokinetic parameters: Cmax= 0.224 mcg/ml (CV 35%, n=4); AUC 1.680 mcg*h/ml (CV 30%, n=4). The animals were treated with azithromycin oleogel rectally. After 24 h, tissue mucosal biopsies were collected from the rectum endoscopically under anesthesia. Samples were fixed and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and analyzed by a clinical pathologist. Overall, there was no evidence of activity, chronicity, or rectal tissue toxicity in the colorectal mucosa of the rectum in our preclinical swine models, either by gross observation or histologic examination (Table 2). This is in keeping with two exploratory clinical trials of an azithromycin suppository, which did not report any clinically observed or patient‐reported safety concerns besides diarrhea at doses of 125‐500mg or 1g of azithromycin suppository. This is an exploratory study to describe the pharmacokinetics of the azithromycin oral and rectal oleogel in humans compared to the reference oral drug to assess the impact of the novel formulation on bioavailability. The investigators will perform a randomized, balanced, single dose, three‐treatment, three‐period, crossover oral bioavailability study under fasted conditions to evaluate the safety and tolerability of azithromycin oleogel and compare the bioavailability of the azithromycin oleogel to the reference drug. The cross‐over design will minimize intersubject variability. Given azithromycin's coefficient of variability, which is estimated to be 30% in humans for the reference drug and 30‐40% for the oleogel in swine experiments, the investigators estimate that 21 subjects will be sufficient. This number also accounts for any potential subject dropouts. Due to the half‐life of azithromycin being 68 hours, the investigators will give 17 days between drug administrations to allow for sufficient wash‐out of at least 5 half‐lives of azithromycin. Subjects in the study will be closely monitored for any signs of adverse reactions. Subjects will be given 250mg of azithromycin in each formulation. The maximum recommended dose of azithromycin in humans is 2g in the oral formulation (bioavailability = 38%; effective dose = 760 mg) or 500mg in the IV formulation. The maximum dose administered to humans is 4g intravenously with the following pharmacokinetic measurements: Cmax 9.91 mcg/ml, AUC 82 mcg*h/ml. At this high dose, side effects seen were most commonly nausea, vomiting, and tinnitus which were mild. In subjects administered 2g intravenous azithromycin, 4 out of 6 developed neutropenia; however, this was not seen at 4g. Based on our non‐clinical data in swine with a dosage of 5 mg/kg and a weight range of 40‐70 kg, the equivalent human dose would be 4.06‐4.89 mg/kg (approximately 305‐367 mg for a 75 kg person). The maximum azithromycin a subject would absorb is 250 mg, which is still lower than the 2g dose with 38% bioavailability ( 760mg). Subjects will be screened for up to 28 days prior to first dose. Treatment Period 1 begins with baseline when subjects are admitted to the study center the night before for a 10‐hour overnight fast prior to the first dose. After admission, subjects will undergo pre‐study evaluations. The subjects will be assigned a subject number before the first study‐specific procedure during baseline (e.g., blood sample). A randomization number will be assigned just prior to dosing, after baseline evaluation results have established their continued study eligibility. After a 10‐hour overnight fast, subject will receive a single dose of rectal oleogel test [X] (250mg drug in about 15 ml of oleogel) with continued fast, oral oleogel test [T] (250mg drug in about 15 ml of oleogel), or oral reference tablet [R] with 240 mL of water. For four hours thereafter, subjects should remain in the fasting state and seated in the upright or semi‐recumbent position. Brief periods of ambulation are allowed for study‐related activities and use of the toilet. Blood samples will be obtained predose and over the next 72 hours. Water will be permitted ad libitum except for one hour before and one hour after dosing. Subjects will be served standardized meals according to a predefined schedule throughout the study. After approximately a 17‐day period away from the study, subjects will return to the study site for Treatment Period 2 and undergo assessments and blood collection similar to Treatment Period 1. The treatment administered will be defined in the randomization schedule. After approximately a 17‐day period away from the study, subjects will return to the study site for Treatment Period 3 and undergo assessments and blood collection similar to Treatment Periods 1 and 2.

However, the role of bacterial virulence factors (VFs) is unclear. Aim: Define association of VFs with cirrhosis severity and infections, their linkage with outcomes, and impact of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT). Methods: VF abundances were determined using metagenomic analysis in stools from controls and cirrhosis patients (compensated, HE‐only, ascites‐only, both and infected). Patients were followed for 90‐day hospitalizations and 1‐year death. Stool samples collected before/after a placebo‐controlled FMT trial were also analyzed. Bacterial species and VFs for all species and selected pathogens (Escherichia, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus spp) were compared between groups. Multi‐variable analyses were performed for clinical biomarkers and VFs for outcome prediction. Changes in VFs pre/post‐FMT and post‐FMT/placebo were analyzed. Results: We included 233 subjects (40 controls, 43 compensated, 30 HE‐only, 20 ascites‐only, 70 both, and 30 infected). Decompensated patients, especially those with infections, had higher VFs coding for siderophores, biofilms, and adhesion factors versus the rest. Biofilm and adhesion VFs from Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus spp associated with death and hospitalizations independent of clinical factors regardless of when all VFs or selected pathogens were analyzed. FMT was associated with reduced VF post‐FMT versus pre‐FMT and post‐placebo groups. Conclusions: Virulence factors from multiple species focused on adhesion and biofilms increased with decompensation and infections, associated with death and hospitalizations independent of clinical factors, and were attenuated with FMT. Strategies focused on targeting multiple virulence factors could potentially impact outcomes in cirrhosis.

Rifaximin, a nonsystemic antibiotic, is indicated in the United States for the treatment of adults with IBS with diarrhea (IBS‐D). In the current post hoc analysis, rifaximin for the treatment of IBS‐D (TARGET 3 study) was assessed in a subgroup of adults receiving concomitant antidepressants. METHODS: Adults diagnosed with IBS received placebo for 10 ± 3 days and completed a daily symptom diary during a single‐blind screening phase. During the placebo screening phase, patients who rated their abdominal pain ≥3 (scale range, 0‐10) and bloating ≥3 (scale range, 0‐6) and had mushy/watery stool (Bristol Stool Scale [BSS] type 6/7) for ≥2 days in a week (ie, IBS‐D) were eligible to receive open‐label rifaximin 550 mg three times daily for 2 weeks. In the original protocol, patients could continue taking antidepressants if they were on a stable dose for ≥6 weeks before study entry. Efficacy response was defined using a composite as well as individual assessment of abdominal pain (≥30% decrease from baseline in mean weekly pain score) and stool consistency (≥50% decrease from baseline in number of days/week with BSS type 6/7) during ≥2 of the first 4 weeks post‐treatment. Additional symptoms response assessments included bloating (≥1‐point decrease in weekly average bloating score), bowel movement urgency (≥30% improvement in percentage of days with urgency), and daily global IBS symptoms (≥1‐point decrease in weekly average IBS symptoms score) during ≥2 of the first 4 weeks post‐treatment. RESULTS: 500 of 2579 patients with IBS‐D were taking stable doses of antidepressants during the 2‐week rifaximin treatment phase; 2438 in the overall group and 473 patients in the concomitant antidepressant subgroup were evaluable for efficacy. A total of 44.1% (1074/2438) and 44.6% (211/473) of patients in the overall group and concomitant antidepressant subgroup, respectively, were abdominal pain plus stool consistency (composite) responders, 56.8% (1384/2438) and 61.3% (290/473), respectively, were responders for the individual component of abdominal pain, and 60.1% (1466/2438) and 57.9% (274/473), respectively, were responders for the individual component of stool consistency. In addition, 56.2% (1369/2438) and 57.5% (272/473) for the overall group and concomitant antidepressant subgroup, respectively, were bloating responders, 52.3% (1276/2438) and 56.4% (267/473), respectively, were bowel movement urgency responders, and 57.5% (1401/2438) and 61.5% (291/473), respectively, were daily global IBS symptom responders. Adverse events reported in ≥2.0% of patients in the concomitant antidepressant subgroup were sinusitis (2.8% [14/500]) and urinary tract infection (2.0% [10/500]). CONCLUSIONS: A 2‐week course of rifaximin 550 mg three times daily improved symptoms in adults with IBS‐D taking concomitant antidepressants, and rifaximin was well tolerated.",35,SUPPL 1,S259‐S260,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 633957571,,,,Journal article; Conference proceeding,*diarrhea; *irritable colon; Abdominal pain; Adult; Adverse drug reaction; Bloating; Conference abstract; Controlled study; Defecation; Drug therapy; Female; Human; Liquid feces; Major clinical study; Male; Side effect; Sinusitis; Urinary tract infection,10.1007/s11606-020-05890-3,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02270956/full,

In the year 2020, 149.2million children under the age of 5 years of age were stunted, accounting for 22% ofstunting globally. Stunting has short‐ and long‐term consequences of increased morbidityand mortality, impairment of neurocognitive development5 , impaired responses to oralvaccines, and increased risk of non‐communicable diseases. Stunting is partly driven byEnvironmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), an enteropathic condition characterised byaltered gut permeability, infiltration of immune cells and changes in villousarchitecture and cell differentiation. EED may help explain why nutritionalsupplementation either during pregnancy or early childhood has minimal value incorrecting childhood stunting. Indeed, EED is believed to be responsible for 40% ofchildhood stunting. Disruption in intestinal barrier function affects gut immunehomeostasis, nutrient flows, and consequently dysbiosis in the gut microbiome. The gutmicrobiota consists of 100 trillion bacteria which interact with epithelial cells, themucus layer and the mucosal immune system that balances tolerance and effector functions.Thus the gut microbiome has an important role in shaping the responsiveness of the gutimmune system. The mucus barrier and the normal gut microbiota limit enteropathogencolonisation. Influx of bacteria from the lumen to the systemic circulation representsmicrobial translocation and initiation of systemic of inflammatory process throughrecognition of pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by Pattern RecognitionReceptors (PRRs) present on Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs). Three fundamental processesdrive the epithelial damage which is so important in EED: infection, undernutrition, andimmune dysfunction. Multiple clinical trials show that efforts to correct malnutritionthrough conventional therapies and improving hygiene and sanitation do not overcomegrowth deficits by more than about 10%. There is increasing interest in the use ofprobiotics which may allow pathogen decolonization, improve barrier function and restoreoverall gut homeostasis. Such therapies are at early stage of trials but may havepotential in addressing the global burden of EED, by improving barrier function and gutpathophysiology.Colonization of gut by enteropathogens is common in children with EED. These includeETEC, Campylobacter, Shigella and Salmonella species. Consistent data from Bangladesh andZambia show that children with refractory stunting carry over four pathogens on average,whilst controls carry less than two. There is also clear evidence of altered compositionof the microbiota in children with EED.Probiotics may serve to overcome the problem of EED through all mechanisms ofpathogenicity, by providing additional bacteria that may help in intestinaldecolonization of pathogenic microorganisms (changing the microbiological niche),promoting epithelial healing, improving nutrient absorption, and restoration of anappropriate immune balance between tolerance and responsiveness.To date the focus of research on childhood stunting has been on the young child. It isincreasingly appreciated, however, that stunting often begins in utero and the focus hasshifted to women's health and pregnancy. For example, the Lancet 2021 Series on maternaland child undernutrition states that ""Investments to reduce undernutrition in women areimportant not only for women's own health but also for the health and nutrition of theirchildren"". Results from rural Bangladesh reveal poor gestational weight gain thatultimately leads to intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight and ultimatelystunting and wasting. Furthermore, another study recently completed in slum settlementsof Dhaka, Bangladesh demonstrated a high prevalence of EED among undernourished women.Intestinal histopathology was abnormal in more than 80% of women. We postulate thatgrowth retardation in utero is a consequence of EED in the mother during pregnancy andlactation. This leads to systemic inflammation, which leads to disadvantageouspartitioning of nutrients, and reduced nutrient availability.This trial will explore the conceptual framework that a well known probiotic, that canimprove the composition of the gut microbiota, can reduce biomarkers of intestinalinflammation and gut health. This will restore healthy microbial signalling to the hostepithelium, ameliorate barrier function through secretion of mucus and antimicrobialfactors, and improve nutrient availability.The primary objective of this trial is to determine if a probiotic, Vivomixx, can reduceinflammation and epithelial damage in pregnant women with environmental enteropathy inthe target countries.The secondary objectives of this trial are:To determine if Vivomixx can reduce enteropathogen colonisation To determine if Vivomixxcan impact the structure and function of the microbiome To determine if Vivomixx canreduce permeability.

Data on the genetic diversity of HAstV in Nigeria are limited. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of classical HAstV in children under 5 years of age with acute gastroenteritis in Ogun State, Nigeria. Fecal samples (331) as well as socio‐demographic and clinical data were collected across the three senatorial districts of the state from February 2015 to April 2017. One hundred seventy‐five samples were randomly selected and analyzed for the presence of HAstV using RT‐PCR. PCR amplicons from positive samples were sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis was done to determine genotypes and lineages. The overall prevalence rate was 19.4% (34), with the highest occurrence observed in 2015 (41.4%). Viral coinfections were detected in 13 cases (38.2%). HAstV infection occurred throughout the year and in all age groups, mainly in the age group of 0‐12 months. There was significant association between prevalence rate and collection year; however, no association was observed with gender, age, symptoms or risk factors. HAstV‐5 was the predominant genotype (76.5%) circulating throughout the study period, followed by HAstV‐1 (23.5%), which circulated only in the first 2 years of the study. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all HAstV‐5 strains detected belonged to the 5a lineage, while HAstV‐1 strains were grouped into lineage 1b.

We first undertook formative research to assess community knowledge and the likelihood of collective community strategy and conditional incentives for improving existing preventive and care‐seeking practices for childhood diarrhea and pneumonia. We developed options for community incentivization and improving group practices, taking local norms and customs into account in the design of the community mobilization strategies and messages. These interventions were then formally evaluated prospectively in a three‐arm cluster randomized controlled trial. Clusters were randomly assigned by a computer algorithm using restricted randomization by an external statistician (1:1:1) into three groups: community mobilization and incentivization (CMI); community mobilization only using an enhanced communication package (CM); and control group. The C3I was an innovative strategy as it involved serial incremental targets of collective improvement in community behavior related to improvement in the coverage of a composite indicator of fully immunized children (FIC), oral rehydration salt (ORS), and the sanitation index (SI).

They are often in need of mechanical ventilation and intensive care. Due to the lower immunity secondary to trauma, they acquire nosocomial infections quickly. Of them, ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP) is very common. The microaspiration of the oral secretions containing the pathologic flora results in VAP. So, oral hygiene is of paramount importance. Various mouthwashes and rinses are available and are commonly used. We planned to compare the effectiveness of alkalization of oral cavity with 0.9% sodium bicarbonate on the incidence of VAP. Methods: After obtaining ethical committee clearance (IRB/Dean/2019/EC/1783) and written informed consent of the patient's attendants, one hundred eleven patients were randomized into two groups. Group CCC received 2% chlorhexidine mouth wash thrice daily whereas group CCS received 0.9% sodium bicarbonate oral rinse once with 2% chlorhexidine mouth wash twice daily. Our primary outcome was the incidence of VAP using the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) from day one to day five. Comparison of Quantitative bacterial load and oral pH on day 1, day 3 and day 5 was our secondary outcome. Results: There was no statistical difference in the incidence of VAP among both groups from day one to day five (p > 0.05). We didn't find any difference in quantitative bacterial load among both groups on days one, three and five (p > 0.05). There was a statistical difference among both groups on oral pH on day three and day five with group CCS having higher oral pH than group CCC. (p = 0.03 on day 3 and 0.01 on day 5). Conclusion: The alkalization of oral cavity with 0.9% sodium bicarbonate oral rinse along with 2% chlorhexidine mouth wash lowered the incidence of VAP as compared to 2% chlorhexidine mouth wash alone but the difference was not statistically significant.",46,,2‐7,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 2020137547,,,,Journal article,*alkalinization; *mouth cavity; *traumatic brain injury; *ventilator associated pneumonia /complication /drug therapy /prevention; APACHE; Adult; Alkalinity; Article; Bacterial load; Breathing exercise; Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score; Comparative effectiveness; Controlled study; Drug efficacy; Female; Human; Incidence; Infection control; Major clinical study; Male; Middle aged; PH; Prospective study; Quantitative analysis; Randomized controlled trial; Scoring system; Stress ulcer /drug therapy /prevention; Tracheal aspiration procedure; Tracheobronchial toilet; Ventilated patient,10.1016/j.tacc.2022.08.004,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02461663/full,

ENT‐01 inhibits the formation of αS aggregates and improved constipation in an open‐label study in patients with PD. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral ENT‐01 for constipation and neurologic symptoms in patients with PD and constipation. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo‐controlled phase 2b study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03781791). SETTING: Outpatient. PATIENTS: 150 patients with PD and constipation. INTERVENTION: ENT‐01 or placebo daily for up to 25 days. After baseline assessment of constipation severity, daily dosing was escalated to the prokinetic dose, the maximum dose (250 mg), or the tolerability limit, followed by a washout period. MEASUREMENTS: The primary efficacy end point was the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week. Neurologic end points included dementia (assessed using the Mini‐Mental State Examination [MMSE]) and psychosis (assessed using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms adapted for PD [SAPS‐PD]). RESULTS: The weekly CSBM rate increased from 0.7 to 3.2 in the ENT‐01 group versus 0.7 to 1.2 in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Improvement in secondary end points included SBMs (P = 0.002), stool consistency (P < 0.001), ease of passage (P = 0.006), and laxative use (P = 0.041). In patients with dementia, MMSE scores improved by 3.4 points 6 weeks after treatment in the ENT‐01 group (n = 14) versus 2.0 points in the placebo group (n = 14). Among patients with psychosis, SAPS‐PD scores improved from 6.5 to 1.7 six weeks after treatment in the ENT‐01 group (n = 5) and from 6.3 to 4.4 in the placebo group (n = 6). ENT‐01 was well tolerated, with no deaths or drug‐related serious adverse events. Adverse events were predominantly gastrointestinal, including nausea (34.4% [ENT‐01] vs. 5.3% [placebo]; P < 0.001) and diarrhea (19.4% [ENT‐01] vs. 5.3% [placebo]; P = 0.016).

Typhi) is a common cause of morbidity in the world. In 2017, 14.3 million cases of Typhoid and paratyphoid fever occurred globally. School age children between 3 to 19 years old are the most affected. Poor sanitation and multi drug resistance have increased the need for vaccines to reduce the global burden of disease. Based on previous trials, typhoid conjugate vaccines have longer‐ lasting protection, higher efficacy, require fewer doses and are suitable from infancy that allows them to be incorporated into the routine immunization program. Our previous phase I trial proved that a novel Vi‐DT typhoid conjugate vaccine is safe and immunogenic in subjects 2–5 and 18–40 years. Our phase II trial consisted of subjects 6 months to 40 years. Our previously published paper on subjects 6 to < 24 months proved that this vaccine is safe and immunogenic for this age group. Therefore, with this paper we aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity in children 2–11 years. Methods: A randomized, observer‐blind, superiority design of Vi‐DT Typhoid conjugate vaccine compared to Vi‐polysaccharide vaccine (Vi‐PS) phase II study was conducted from October 2018 to December 2018 where 200 subjects aged 2–11 years were recruited. A blood sample prior to vaccination was taken, followed by administration of a single dose of either test vaccine (Vi‐DT) or control vaccine (Vi‐PS) and then a second blood sample was collected 28 days post vaccination. Adverse reactions were assessed and antibody increment was evaluated at 28 days post vaccination through collected serum sample. Results: Pain was the most common local reaction. Fever and muscle pain were the most common systemic reactions. Both Vi‐DT and Vi‐PS groups had roughly the same number of adverse reactions. At 28 days post vaccination, 100% of subjects in the Vi‐DT group and 93% of subjects in the Vi‐PS group produced antibody increment ≥4 times. The Vi‐DT group produced a higher GMT as compared to Vi‐PS. Conclusion: Vi‐DT vaccine is safe and immunogenic in children 2–11 years old.

In low‐resource settings, household finished floors (eg, concrete floors) might reduce transmission of soil‐transmitted helminths and G duodenalis. Methods: In a prospective cohort of children nested within two randomised trials in rural Bangladesh and Kenya, we estimated associations between household finished flooring and soil‐transmitted helminths and G duodenalis prevalence. In 2015–16, we collected stool samples from children aged 2–16 years in rural Bangladesh and Kenya. We detected soil‐transmitted helminth infection using quantitative PCR (qPCR; Bangladesh n=2800; Kenya n=3094), and G duodenalis using qPCR in Bangladesh (n=6894) and ELISA in Kenya (n=8899). We estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) using log‐linear models adjusted for potential confounders. Findings: 7187 (92·2%) of 7795 children in Bangladesh and 9077 (93·7%) of 9686 children in Kenya provided stool specimens that were analysed by qPCR. At enrolment, 691 (10%) households in Bangladesh and 471 (5%) households in Kenya had finished floors. In both countries, household finished flooring was associated with lower Ascaris lumbricoides prevalence (Bangladesh aPR 0·33, 95% CI 0·14–0·78; Kenya 0·62, 0·39–0·98) and any soil‐transmitted helminths (Bangladesh 0·73, 0·52–1·01; Kenya 0·57, 0·37–0·88). Household finished floors were also associated with lower Necator americanus prevalence in Bangladesh (0·52, 0·29–0·94) and G duodenalis prevalence in both countries (Bangladesh 0·78, 0·64–0·95; Kenya 0·82, 0·70–0·97). Interpretation: In low‐resource settings, living in households with finished floors over a 2‐year period was associated with lower prevalence of G duodenalis and some soil‐transmitted helminths in children.

We randomized 88 obese patients with type 2 diabetes to one of two groups for 24 weeks: control or synbiotic (Lactica‐seibacillus paracasei strain Shirota (previously Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota) and Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult, and galactooligosaccharides). The primary endpoint was the change in interleukin‐6 from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints were evaluation of the gut microbiota in feces and blood, fecal organic acids, high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein, lipopolysaccharide‐binding protein, and glycemic control. Synbiotic administration for 24 weeks did not significantly affect changes in interleukin‐6 from baseline to 24 weeks (0.35 ± 1.99 vs. −0.24 ± 1.75 pg/mL, respectively). Relative to baseline, however, at 24 weeks after synbiotic administration there were positive changes in the counts of Bifidobacterium and total lactobacilli, the relative abundances of Bifidobacterium species such as Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and the concentrations of acetic and butyric acids in feces. No significant changes in inflammatory markers were found in the synbiotic group compared to the control group.

This study assessed safety and efficacy of a probiotic in altering the intestinal milieu and mitigating gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) in endurance runners. In a double blind, crossover study, 16 runners were randomized to 4 weeks of daily supplementation with a probiotic cocktail containing Pediococcus acidilactici bacteria and Lactobacillus plantarum or placebo. Fasting blood and stool samples were collected for measurement of gut permeability markers, immune parameters, and microbiome analyses. Treadmill run tests were performed before and after treatment; participants ran at 65%‐70% of VO2max at 27 °C for a maximum of 90 min or until fatigue/GIS developed. A blood sample was collected after the treadmill run test. In healthy individuals, 4 weeks of probiotic supplementation did not alter health parameters, although a marginal reduction in aspartate aminotransferase levels was observed with probiotic treatment only (p = 0.05). GIS, gut permeability‐associated parameters (intestinal fatty acid binding protein, lipopolysaccharide binding protein, zonulin, and cytokines), and intestinal microbial content were not altered by the probiotic supplementation. Post‐run measurements of GIS and gut‐associated parameters did not differ between groups; however, the observed lack of differences is confounded by an absence of measurable functional outcome as GIS was not sufficiently induced during the run. Under the current study conditions, the probiotic was safe to use, and did not affect gut‐ or immune‐associated parameters, or intestinal symptoms in a healthy population.

However, the effect of BQT and subsequent fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) on the gut microbiota is less known. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary hospital in China from January 2019 to October 2020, with the primary endpoints the effect of BQT on the gut microbiota and the effect of FMT on the gut microbiota after bismuth quadruple therapy eradication therapy. A 14‐day BQT with amoxicillin and clarithromycin was administered to H. pylori‐positive subjects, and after eradication therapy, patients received a one‐time FMT or placebo treatment. We then collected stool samples to assess the effects of 14‐day BQT and FMT on the gut microbiota. 16 s rDNA and metagenomic sequencing were used to analyze the structure and function of intestinal flora. We also used Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) to evaluate gastrointestinal symptom during treatment. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were recruited and 15 were assigned to either FMT or placebo groups. After eradication therapy, alpha‐diversity was decreased in both groups. At the phylum level, the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes decreased, while Proteobacteria increased. At the genus level, the abundance of beneficial bacteria decreased, while pathogenic bacteria increased. Eradication therapy reduced some resistance genes abundance while increased the resistance genes abundance linked to Escherichia coli. While they all returned to baseline by Week 10. Besides, the difference was observed in Week 10 by the diarrhea score between two groups. Compared to Week 2, the GSRS total score and diarrhea score decreased in Week 3 only in FMT group. CONCLUSIONS: The balance of intestinal flora in patients can be considerably impacted by BQT in the short term, but it has reverted back to baseline by Week 10.

In the year 2020, 149.2 million children under the age of 5 years of age were stunted, accounting for 22% of stunting globally2. Stunting has short‐ and long‐term consequences of increased morbidity and mortality3,4, impairment of neurocognitive development5 , impaired responses to oral vaccines6,7, and increased risk of non‐communicable diseases. Stunting is partly driven by Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), an enteropathic condition characterised by altered gut permeability, infiltration of immune cells and changes in villous architecture and cell differentiation8,9. EED may help explain why nutritional supplementation either during pregnancy or early childhood has minimal value in correcting childhood stunting10,11 Indeed, EED is believed to be responsible for 40% of childhood stunting12. Disruption in intestinal barrier function affects gut immune homeostasis, nutrient flows, and consequently dysbiosis in the gut microbiome. The gut microbiota consists of 100 trillion bacteria which interact with epithelial cells, the mucus layer and the mucosal immune system that balances tolerance and effector functions. Thus the gut microbiome has an important role in shaping the responsiveness of the gut immune system13. The mucus barrier and the normal gut microbiota limit enteropathogen colonisation. Influx of bacteria from the lumen to the systemic circulation represents microbial translocation and initiation of systemic of inflammatory process through recognition of pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) present on Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs). Three fundamental processes drive the epithelial damage which is so important in EED: infection, undernutrition, and immune dysfunction. Multiple clinical trials show that efforts to correct malnutrition through conventional therapies and improving hygiene and sanitation do not overcome growth deficits by more than about 10%10,11. There is increasing interest in the use of probiotics which may allow pathogen decolonization, improve barrier function and restore overall gut homeostasis. Such therapies are at early stage of trials but may have potential in addressing the global burden of EED, by improving barrier function and gut pathophysiology. Colonization of gut by enteropathogens is common in children with EED. These include ETEC, Campylobacter, Shigella and Salmonella species. Consistent data from Bangladesh and Zambia show that children with refractory stunting carry over four pathogens on average, whilst controls carry less than two14,15. There is also clear evidence of altered composition of the microbiota in children with EED16,17,18. Probiotics may serve to overcome the problem of EED through all mechanisms of pathogenicity, by providing additional bacteria that may help in intestinal decolonization of pathogenic microorganisms (changing the microbiological niche), promoting epithelial healing, improving nutrient absorption, and restoration of an appropriate immune balance between tolerance and responsiveness. To date the focus of research on childhood stunting has been on the young child. It is increasingly appreciated, however, that stunting often begins in utero and the focus has shifted to women's health and pregnancy. For example, the Lancet 2021 Series on maternal and child undernutrition states that ""Investments to reduce undernutrition in women are important not only for women's own health but also for the health and nutrition of their children""19. Results from rural Bangladesh reveal poor gestational weight gain that ultimately leads to intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight and ultimately stunting and wasting20,21. Furthermore, another study recently completed in slum settlements of Dhaka, Bangladesh demonstrated a high prevalence of EED among undernourished women. Intestinal histopathology was abnormal in more than 80% of women22. We postulate that growth retardation in utero is a consequence of EED in the mother during pregnancy and lactation. This leads to systemic inflammation, which leads to disadvantageous partitioning of nutrients, and reduced nutrient availability.

CONCLUSIONS: Monotherapy with a single fresh FMT is an effective and safe strategy to induce long‐term remission without drugs in patients with active UC and may be an alternative induction therapy for recurrent UC or even primary UC. RESULTS: Twenty‐six eligible patients were enrolled, and 6 patients were excluded. Ultimately, 20 patients were randomized to the FMT group (n = 10) and the control group (n = 10); 80% were females (F/M = 16/4), the mean age was 48 ± 14 years, and the mean duration was 6.4 ± 8.2 years. The mean length of post‐FMT follow‐up was 19.1 ± 10.1 months (6‐38). No statistically significant differences in baseline demographic or clinical characteristics were found between the groups. Ninety percent of patients in the FMT group and 50% of patients in the control group met the primary endpoint at week 8. The Mayo score was significantly decreased compared with that of the control group (n = 10) when reassessed at week 4 (P = 0.001) and week 8 (P = 0.019) after FMT; there was no significant difference 6 months after treatment.

Participants tolerated FMT treatment, and no adverse events occurred during long‐term follow‐up, with one treatment‐related significant adverse event (EBV infection) occurring within 2 weeks after FMT. Stool microbiota composition analysis indicated improved gut microbiota diversity after FMT, with expansion of stool‐donor taxa. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla of the gut microbiota in active UC patients. The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes decreased and that of Proteobacteria increased significantly in active UC patients compared with donors, while Firmicutes showed no significant changes. A single fresh FMT could effectively reconstruct the gut microbiota composition in patients with active UC and maintain stability, with increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Proteobacteria abundance.

Animal and human studies support the beneficial role of aleurone consumption in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Gut microbiota fiber fermentation, polyphenol metabolism and betaine/choline metabolism may in part contribute to the physiological effects of aleurone. As primary objective, this study evaluated whether wheat aleurone supplemented foods could modify plasma homocysteine. Secondary objectives included changes in CVD biomarkers, fecal microbiota composition and plasma/urine metabolite profiles. Methods: A parallel double‐blind, placebo‐controlled and randomized trial was carried out in two groups of obese/overweight subjects, matched for age, BMI and gender, consuming foods supplemented with either aleurone (27 g/day) (AL, n = 34) or cellulose (placebo treatment, PL, n = 33) for 4 weeks. Results: No significant changes in plasma homocysteine or other clinical markers were observed with either treatment. Dietary fiber intake increased after AL and PL, animal protein intake increased after PL treatment. We observed a significant increase in fecal Bifidobacterium spp with AL and Lactobacillus spp with both AL and PL, but overall fecal microbiota community structure changed little according to 16S rRNA metataxonomics. Metabolomics implicated microbial metabolism of aleurone polyphenols and revealed distinctive biomarkers of AL treatment, including alkylresorcinol, cinnamic, benzoic and ferulic acids, folic acid, fatty acids, benzoxazinoid and roasted aroma related metabolites. Correlation analysis highlighted bacterial genera potentially linked to urinary compounds derived from aleurone metabolism and clinical parameters. Conclusions: Aleurone has potential to modulate the gut microbial metabolic output and increase fecal bifidobacterial abundance. However, in this study, aleurone did not impact on plasma homocysteine or other CVD biomarkers.

Primary end point(s): The primary endpoint is the percentage of children showing > 30% reduction in abdominal pain intensity after 8 weeks of treatment from baseline. Abdominal pain intensity will be scored with the Wong‐Baker faces scale, during 7 consecutive days, using a smartphone abdominal pain app. Secondary Objective: Secondary aims are to study the effect of peppermint oil capsules on other disease‐related outcomes. These are recently defined outcome measures for trials in children with chronic abdominal pain: degree of reduction in pain frequency and pain intensity, percentage of patients with adequate improvement of complaints, hours of absenteeism, quality of life, feelings of anxiety & depression, bowel habits, taste, ease of use and side effects of the treatment. Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: At the end of the treatment, 8 weeks (T2) after baseline (T0). Other time points in this study are halfway treatment (T1 = 4 weeks) and after 4 weeks of follow‐up (T3=12 weeks) SECONDARY OUTCOME: Secondary end point(s): • Change in pain duration: abdominal pain duration will be scored in minutes of abdominal pain per day during 7 consecutive days, using the smartphone abdominal pain app at T0, T1, T2 and T3.; ; • Change in pain frequency: abdominal pain frequency will be scored as the average amount of days with pain during 7 consecutive days, using the smartphone abdominal pain app at T0, T1, T2 and T3.; ; • Change in abdominal pain intensity: abdominal pain intensity will be scored during a period of 7 consecutive days using a 10‐point Wong‐Baker faces scale, using daily the smartphone abdominal pain app at T0, T1, T2 and T3. ; ; • Change in Quality of Life: Quality of life is measured by the Dutch version of the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory questionnaire (PedsQL 4.0). It will be measured at baseline (T0) and after 8 weeks (T2, end of treatment). ; • Change in depression and anxiety score: depression and anxiety scores are measured by the Revised Anxiety and Depression Scale‐short version (RCADS‐25) at T0 and T2. ; ; • School absences during the treatment: hours of school absence in the previous are measured by a self‐designed questionnaire at T0, T1, T2, and T3.; ; • Use of pain rescue medication during the treatment (like paracetamol or NSAIDs): assessed by the smart phone app, on which patients can record the use of rescue pain medication. It will be measured at T0, T1, T2, and T3. ; ; • Expectancy of the treatment: expectations of both parents separately, and the child of the treatment on a scale of 0 (no improvement) to 10 (very much improved) are measured by a self‐designed questionnaire at start of baseline period. ; ; • Change in defecation pattern: change in defecation pattern is scored using the smart phone app, on which patients can record daily stool frequency and consistency according to the Bristol Stool Scale. This will be measured at T0, T1, T2 and T3.; ; • Adequate relief: patients and parents will be asked whether they/their child has adequate relief of IBS/FAP‐NOS symptoms using a single question (""Did you/your child have adequate relief of IBS/FAP‐NOS symptoms (abdominal discomfort/pain, bowel habits, and other symptoms like nausea and bloating) over the past week?"") scored on a dichotomous scale (Yes/No). This instrument will be measured at 4 weeks (T1), at the end of treatment (T2), and at 12 weeks (4‐week follow‐up (T3).; ; • Health status: the Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI‐3) will be applied as a multi‐attribute utility measure of health status and will be used in the cost‐effectiveness and cost‐utility analysis. It is suitable for assessing children, but because children may be too young to provide reliable and valid information about their own health status, proxy measurements will be taken from parents. The health utilities derived from the HUI‐3 have been anchored with 1 indicating perfect health and 0 indicating death. Quality adjusted life years (QALY) will be calculated by taking the sum of the utility of health states over time by the time in between successive measurements. It will be measured at start of the baseline period, and at 8 weeks.; ; • Costs: the Dutch Health and Labour Questionnaire (HLQ) will be adapted to the study setting to measure the direct and indirect costs of health care utilization, work absenteeism by parents, and school absenteeism by children. It will be measured at T0 and T2.; ; • Safety of peppermint oil use: incidence of adverse events will be reported by the participants from the time of informed consent until the 4 weeks follow‐up using open questions: “did you experience other symptoms than usual, that may have been caused by the study medication? ; ; • Taste and ease of use of peppermint oil capsules. Taste of capsules will be scored after 8 weeks using a single question: did you like the taste of the pills: not at all/ not so much/ it was okay/ it was nice/ it was very nice. Ease of use of capsules will also be scored after 8 weeks using a single question: how easy were the pills to use and swallow? Very easy/ easy/ reasonable/ difficult/ very difficult.; ; • Other study parameters are subject characteristics like age, sex, previous treatments, duration of symptoms before start study and family history.; ; • Association between SNP’s in placebo genes and response to peppermint oil capsules, placebo capsules and peppermints will be determined by collecting DNA through a saliva swab. DNA samples will be genotyped using the Infinium Global Screening Array. Variants previously identified to be associated with the placebo effect will be extracted from the imputed data and analyzed in a candidate gene approach.; Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: time points are T0 = baseline; T1 = 4 weeks after starting treatment; T2 = 8 weeks after starting treatment/ end of treatment period; T3= 4 weeks of follow‐up after end of treatment.

The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in health and affects the treatment effect of various interventions. However, the role of gut microbiota in VE remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the longitudinal impact of VE treatment on body health and the gut microbiota. METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 90 healthy individuals. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups: a treatment group receiving VE, another antioxidant treatment group receiving GSE, and a control group receiving a placebo. We found that VE ameliorated blood cholesterol levels by reducing the levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) in healthy volunteers. After the intervention, there was an increase in the relative abundance of short‐chain fatty acid (SCFA)‐producing bacteria and bile acid metabolizers. Specifically, the abundances of Lachnospira sp. and Faecalibacterium spp. increased in the VE. Interestingly, the gut microbiota of poor responders harbored a greater proportion of disease‐associated bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: VE could promote health by lowering LDL‐C, partly and indirectly by affecting gut bacteria with the ability to produce SCFAs or metabolize bile acids.

CN-02587907,"NCT05973916,",Comprehensive Intervention to Improve Environmental Disinfection,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05973916,2023,"Background and introductionAs declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016, antimicrobial resistanceamong the commonest human pathogens, i.e., the multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO), poseone of the biggest challenges in modern Medicine and one of the biggest threats tohumanity. MDROs are prevalent in acute‐care hospitals, and in addition are continuouslyemerging at non‐acute‐care healthcare settings, and even in the community. The currentglobal SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic, further amplifies the enormous burdens imposed by MDROs onhospitalized previously non‐sick individuals. The commonest Gram‐positive MDROs aremethicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin‐resistant enterococci(VRE), and Clostridioides difficile (C. diff). The commonest Gram‐negative MDROs arecarbapenem‐resistant and/or carbapenemase‐producing Enterobacterales (CRE), Acinetobacterbaumannii (CRAB), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA). Acquisition of an MDRO in thehospital is associated with devastating outcomes to the individual patient and withenormous fiscal burden imposed on health facilities. Moreover, In Israel and in manyother countries, there are mandatory reporting regulations for certain MDROs, and therates of MDRO acquisitions serve as ""pay per performance"" initiatives. This addsadditional burden in terms of potential bad reputation and reductions in reimbursements.The patient's immediate environment, specifically ""high‐touch surfaces"" (e.g., touchscreens, monitor, respirator, feeding device, infusion pump, the entire bed, cabin,nurse's call‐on button, light switches, fluid balance charts hanged on bed, linen,armchairs, curtains, and so on), serves as reservoir and vector for MDRO distribution andtransmission from patient to patient. Therefore, health facilities have strong motivationto improve the level of cleaning and disinfection of patients' immediate environment, inan effort to improve patient safety, quality of clinical care, and reduce hospital costswhile improving its reputation.Many items commonly used in traditional and routine care of hospitalized patients, havebeen described as reservoirs and/or fomites for transmission of pathogens, which can leadto nosocomial MDRO‐related outbreaks. Environmental remnants of MDROs on immediate hightouch surfaces spread from patient to patient through staff, shared equipment, ordirectly from patient to patient (less common). While a carrier of a specific MDRO residein his/her room or unit, the same MDRO can be isolated (frequently in high inoculums)from the patient's immediate environment (e.g. bedrail, monitor, infusion pump), fromhigh‐touch surfaces (e.g., light switches, water taps, nurse's call‐on button), and evenfrom distant locations in the room (e.g. ceiling). MDROs can remain viable and survive inthose transmitting‐prone environmental locations for prolonged periods, long after theprevious carrier who contaminated the environment had been discharged.The levels of environmental cleaning and disinfection of high‐touch surfaces, is known tobe low in hospitals. The current cleaning guidelines at Shamir Medical Center (SMC), asper the Israeli MOH regulations, are as follows: while the patient is in their bed, theunit is subjected to daily cleaning, and after the patient leaves, the unit is subjectedto ""terminal cleaning"", a supposable standardized enhanced cleaning protocol. Recurrentaudits and observations from all over the world clearly suggests that the level ofcleaning and disinfection of patients' environments in acute‐care hospitals isunsatisfactory most hours of the day. In order to improve this crucial aspect associatedwith MDRO transmission and spread in hospitals, a multidisciplinary approach iswarranted, with implementation of novel solutions both technological, and with regards toaspects associated with human capital. To add an additional complexity to the situation,in Israeli hospitals, as in many other countries, the responsibility ofcleaning/disinfecting patient's immediate environment, is divided. The bed, bedsidetable, infusion pump, monitor, cables and additional immediate surroundings of anindividual patient, are cleaned by nurse assistants, while the floor, sink, toilets,light switches and walls (shared by all room occupants), are cleaned by environmentalservices (EVS) personnel. This separation in responsibilities creates eventual gaps inthe overall level of cleaning/disinfection of certain items, which are frequentlyassociated with MDRO transmission. There are continuous shortages both in terms of fulltime effort (fte) allocation, and in terms of specified professional training, amongthese two frequently neglected sectors (i.e., nurse assistants and EVS personnel). Theemployment turnaround time of these personnel sectors is very high, with no establishmentof a stable local base of knowledge and expertise. In order for an intervention thatimproves the level of cleaning /disinfection of patients' environment to be successful,human capital considerations must be acknowledged and addressed. A designated team(referred to as ""cleaning commando"" in certain facilities), responsible to all thevarious aspects associated with cleaning and disinfecting the patient's environment, buthave no other additional responsibilities, and is managed by the same management, couldtheoretically improve the human capital aspects associated with improving the level ofcleaning/disinfecting patients' environments in hospitals.The market is flooded in recent years, and even more since the emergence of theSARS‐CoV‐2 pandemia, with novel technologies that aim to improve the level ofenvironmental disinfection of patients' surroundings and high‐touch surfaces. Thesetechnologies should always be applied on top of an effective process of cleaning, whichis always executed by humans. These technologies only add an additional level ofmechanized controlled process for enhancing environmental disinfection, but could neverreplace the necessity of an established effective and monitored process of initialcleaning, a process that should be executed, as mentioned above, by trained and centrallymanaged personnel. Initially, many of the technologies in this field of immediateenvironment disinfection, were applied on empty patients' units only. This creates manyoperational complexities in busy acute‐care hospitals, with fast turnaround time ofhospitalized beds. The ""new generation"" of technologies, are aimed to disinfect patients'immediate environment, continuously, while the patients reside in the unit. On the onehand, technology needs to be effective and bactericidal, but on the other hand,concentrations of the active disinfecting ingredients or materials, should not be toxicand endanger patients under no circumstances. Continuously disinfecting surfaces by usingVYV led lights, and filtering the air by using the QleanAir Scandinavia┬« device, are bothlicensed to operate while the patients are in the room. Both are ""effective"" in‐vitroagainst the six groups of MDROs mentioned above. This could theoretically add anadditional mode for prevention of MDRO transmission and spread in hospitals. However,controlled clinical data, with 'real' clinical outcomes, pertaining to the actualefficacy of these technologies in preventing MDRO acquisitions, are absent. In order toconvince stakeholder administrators to invest in implementation of certain preventingtechnologies, clinical studies, analyzing the effectiveness of technologies in preventingactual clinical outcomes, are warranted.Crossover design is considered today the gold standard methodology in the clinicalresearch field of infection control and hospital epidemiology. This design enables tocontrol for multiple confounders, associated with the Hawthorne effect, which is verycommon in studies assessing the controlled efficacy of a certain infection control newlyimplemented intervention.In order to reduce the environmental contamination by MDRO carriers, and the incidence ofMDRO acquisitions in hospitals by na├»ve patients, we aim to implement a comprehensive andmultifactorial intervention, to improve the level of cleaning/disinfecting patients'immediate environment. The suggested intervention will contain components associated withhuman capital and with the implementation of two advanced technologies. We aim to trialthis comprehensive intervention, in a prospective crossover design, in a 'real‐world'clinical scenario, analyzing its efficacy on 'hard' and direct clinical outcomes.Study hypotheses 1. A comprehensive intervention (consisting of establishing a ""patient's unit commando""team, while continuously disinfecting patient's unit by using VYV led lights andQleanAir Scandinavia┬« air filtering device) will reduce the rate of new carriageacquisitions of the MDROs: 1) MRSA, 2) VRE, 3) CRE, 4) A. baumannii, 5) P.aeruginosa, and 6) C. difficile. 2. A comprehensive intervention (consisting of establishing a ""patient's unit commando""team, while continuously disinfecting patient's unit by using VYV led lights andQleanAir Scandinavia┬« air filtering device) will reduce the incidence ofhospital‐acquired bloodstream infections (HA‐BSI). 3. A comprehensive intervention (consisting of establishing a ""patient's unit commando""team, while continuously disinfecting patient's unit by using VYV led lights andQleanAir Scandinavia┬« air filtering device) will reduce the incidence ofhospital‐acquired urinary‐tract infections (HAUTI).Study Aim 1. Analyze the role of a comprehensive intervention (consisting of establishing a ""patient's unit commando"" team, while continuously disinfecting patient's unit by using VYV led lights and QleanAir Scandinavia┬« air filtering device) in reducing the rate of new carriage acquisitions of MDROs (MRSA, VRE, CRE, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, C. difficile). 2. Analyze the role of a comprehensive intervention (consisting of establishing a ""patient's unit commando"" team, while continuously disinfecting patient's unit by using VYV led lights and QleanAir Scandinavia┬« air filtering device) in reducing the incidence of HA‐BSI. 3. Analyze the role of a comprehensive intervention (consisting of establishing a ""patient's unit commando"" team, while continuously disinfecting patient's unit by using VYV led lights and QleanAir Scandinavia┬« air filtering device) in reducing the incidence of HAUTI. Study protocol 1. Prospective cluster‐randomized placebo‐controlled cross‐over study design. 2. The study will be conducted over 15 months; each study phase will last 6 months, with a pre‐study period (1 month), a washout period (1 month) and a post study period (1 month). ΓÇó Pre‐study period: all patient rooms at both departments will be cleaned and disinfected according to the ""common practice"" as detailed below. ΓÇó Phase I: o Medicine A: cleaning of patients' rooms will be subjected to a comprehensive intervention, consisting of: 1) a ""patient's unit commando"" team for daily and for terminal cleaning, 2) all lights in patients' room are VYV led lights, and 3) in each room, a QleanAir Scandinavia┬« filtering machine will be placed. ‐ Medicine B: patients' rooms will be cleaned and disinfected according to the current ""common practice"" as detailed below. ΓÇó Washout period in both hospitals: all patient rooms at both departments will be cleaned and disinfected according to the ""common practice"" as detailed below. ΓÇó Phase II: ‐ Medicine A: patients' rooms will be cleaned and disinfected according to the current ""common practice"" as detailed below. ‐ Medicine B: cleaning of patients' rooms will be subjected to a comprehensive intervention, consisting of: 1) a ""patient's unit commando"" team for daily and for terminal cleaning, 2) all lights in patients' room are VYV led lights, and 3) in each room, a QleanAir Scandinavia┬« filtering machine will be placed. ‐ Post‐study period: all patient rooms at both departments will be cleaned and disinfected according to the ""common practice"" as detailed below. ‐ The ""patient's unit commando"" team will consist of 6 staff members, trained specifically by the infection control team at Shamir Medical Center. The ""patient's unit commando"" team will be responsible, during the intervention, for the daily cleaning of the patients subjected to isolation precautions, and will be conducting the terminal cleaning following discharge of every patient from the unit that is under the intervention. Microbiological studies: ΓÇó Clinical cultures are all processed at the SMC clinical microbiology laboratory. The laboratory adhere to the U.S. Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standards and criteria. No additional cultures will be obtained specifically for this protocol. o MRSA, VRE, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa will be determined according to a Vitek‐2 automated system and according to CLSI breakpoints and criteria. o CRE will be determined according to the Israeli MOH national diagnostic guidelines (2013) and based, again, on CLSI criteria. o Toxin‐producing C. difficile will be determined based of a GDH‐based serology test (C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETE┬«; AlereΓäó) and if necessary (i.e., inconclusive serology test result: positive for C. difficile GDH antigen but negative for C. difficile toxins), will be confirmed by a PCR‐based test (Xpert┬« C. difficile; Cepheid┬⌐). Samples will be processed according to national Israeli guidelines (2013) and according to CLSI criteria. o All MDROs will be stored in ‐800C for future molecular analyses. ΓÇó Representative MDROs will be typed later on for future detailed transmission dynamics investigations. ‐ The laboratory will be blinded to the source of the cultures (i.e., to the fact of whether or not the unit is at its interventional phase). Patients: 1. The two departments will perform, per local Infection Control regulations: i. Nasalculture for MRSA upon admission to the unit and weekly thereafter (same day andshift every week).ii. Rectal culture for VRE, and CRE upon admission to the unit and weekly thereafter(same day and shift every week).iii. Sputum and skin cultures (using sponges) for the presence of A. baumannii and P.aeruginosa upon admission to the unit and weekly thereafter (same day and shift everyweek). 2. All the surveillance for MDRO new acquisitions and hospital‐acquired bloodstreaminfections (BSI) are conducted routinely and continuously by the Infection Controlteam at SMC. The PI serves as the head of the Infection Control unit and ispersonally involved in the surveillances processes for those endpoints. 3. Acquisitions of pre‐specified MDROs: 1. MDRO acquisition will be defined based on clinical samples obtained frompreviously‐not‐known carriers. In addition, surveillance cultures for all the MDROof interest (except C. difficile) would be obtained upon admission and weeklythereafter. An acquisition will be defined as a patient who was negative uponadmission but became positive ΓëÑ 72 hours after admission or within 72 hours afteradmission if the patient was hospitalized in the hospital during the last 30 days. 2. MRSA, VRE, and P. aeruginosa will be determined according to the Vitek‐2 automatedsystem and according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria. 3. CRE will be determined according to the Israeli ministry of health (MOH) nationaldiagnostic guidelines (2013) and based, again, of the CLSI cutoffs and criteria. 4. C. difficile infection will be determined according to the Israeli ministry ofhealth (MOH) national guidelines (2012), based on the presence of toxin‐producingorganism: first by GDH‐based serology test and if needed, by confirmatory PCR‐basedtest. 5. The monitoring and surveillance of hospital‐acquired BSI, conducted by InfectionControl personnel, is based on the Israeli Ministry of Health monitoring criteria,which resembles exactly the U.S. Centers for disease Control and Prevention (CDC)criteria. 6. The monitoring and surveillance of hospital‐acquired UTI, conducted by InfectionControl personnel, is based on the Israeli Ministry of Health monitoring criteriafrom 2014, which resembles (but is not exactly the same) as the U.S. CDC diagnosticcriteria.Power calculationsThe power calculations are based on the primary study outcome, which is the MDRO newacquisitions incidence. Based on surveillance data from SMC, during 2019, the incidence(in the two departments) of MDRO new acquisition was 4.1 per 1,000 patient days. Even ifthe impact of the intervention would be relatively mild, and it will reduce theacquisition rate by only 10%, the sample size will still enable us with ╬▓=0.8 and ╬▒=0.01to determine the statistical significant efficacy of the intervention.Statistical analysisData will be summarized with descripted statistic based on the Data reference sheet.The two groups (department ) will be compared for admission data, baselinecharacteristics and risk factors with the independent t‐test and the Chi‐Square test. .New carriage acquisitions of MDROs (MRSA, VRE, CRE, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, C.difficile), the incidence of HA‐BSI and incidence of HAUTI will point estimated by rates,followed by 95% confidence interval.Each department will be test for difference between the control and treatment period bythe McNemar test for paired proportions.Comparisons between study groups will be made by Z test for proportions for each Phaseseparately and for the entire study.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT05973916,,,Trial registry record,Iatrogenic Disease,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02587907/full,

We aimed to investigate the effects of Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 supplementation on the development of FGIDs, crying and sleep duration, and the gut microbial composition in infants exposed to antibiotics during the neonatal period. In this randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study, we included 89 term neonates treated with antibiotics. Neonates received the study product for six weeks. FGIDs, assessed by the Infant Gastrointestinal Symptom Questionnaire, crying and sleep duration were assessed at four and eight weeks, and six months after enrolment. Faecal samples were collected six weeks and twelve months after enrolment. The gut microbial community composition was analysed using 16S amplicon sequencing and qPCR. The proportion of infants with FGIDs was greater in the control group, although the difference between the groups was significant only six months after enrolment. At all time points, the probiotic group presented a longer sleep duration and shorter crying time than the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Probiotic consumption had no significant effect on the gut microbiota composition except for increased L. reuteri DSM 17938 abundance in the probiotic group at six weeks after enrolment. At specific time points after supplementation with L. reuteri DSM 17938, a reduction in the prevalence of FGIDs was observed in the probiotic group.

Not all individuals exposed to Shigella or other enteropathogens have symptomatic responses, and investigating the differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals can further our understanding of enteropathogen proliferation and symptomatic responses. Here, we profiled the fecal microbiomes of 45 individuals infected with Shigella sonnei strain 53G through 16S rRNA sequencing in a controlled human infection model before and during infection, after antibiotic treatment, and after clinical recovery. This model allowed for a detailed exploration of microbiome temporal dynamics during infection, as well as a comparative analysis between those with shigellosis (defined as severe symptoms caused by Shigella infection, including severe diarrhea, fever, and/or abdominal pain) and those without shigellosis. Alpha diversity decreased to a greater degree in individuals with shigellosis. Perturbations in microbial composition during infection and antibiotic treatment were significantly larger in individuals diagnosed with shigellosis than in those who were not. Participants with shigellosis had persistent changes to their microbiomes after recovery, while those without shigellosis recovered to a composition resembling their pre‐infection microbiomes. These persistent changes included taxa associated with gut inflammation, such as a decrease in Faecalibacterium and an increase in Ruminococcus gnavus. Furthermore, the initial microbiomes of participants who did not develop shigellosis had a greater abundance of taxa associated with short‐chain fatty acid production than participants who did develop shigellosis, including Bifidobacterium, Roseburia, and Faecalibacterium. These data could help prevent Shigella infection or symptoms.IMPORTANCEDiarrheal disease is a major contributor to the global disease burden and can lead to an increased individual risk of chronic sequelae post‐infection, such as irritable bowel syndrome, reactive arthritis, and altered gut permeability. Understanding the differential responses of individuals to enteropathogen exposure can elucidate factors that could lead to treatments or preventative measures to reduce the disease burden. Here, we use a controlled human infection model study to directly identify the effects of Shigella sonnei 53G infection on the microbiome. We identified taxa that were more or less abundant in participants who would develop shigellosis during the study, as well as persistent changes after recovery in the microbiomes of participants who developed severe symptoms. Understanding these changes could elucidate ways to prevent Shigella infection or recover altered microbiomes after recovery.CLINICAL TRIALSThis study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT02816346.",10,4,e0090624,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 40152601,,,,,Journal article,"*Dysentery, Bacillary [drug therapy, microbiology]; *Gastrointestinal Microbiome [drug effects]; *Shigella sonnei [genetics]; Adult; Anti‐Bacterial Agents [therapeutic use]; Bacteria [classification, genetics, isolation & purification]; Feces [microbiology]; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S [genetics]; Young Adult",10.1128/msphere.00906-24,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02843224/full,

Here, we aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using commercially‐available anaerobic cultivated human intestinal microbiota (ACHIM) in SSc. Methods Ten patients with SSc were randomized to ACHIM (n = 5) or placebo (n = 5) in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled 16‐week pilot. All patients had mild to severe upper and lower GI symptoms including diarrhea, distention/bloating and/or fecal incontinence at baseline.

Odevixibat, an orally administered, selective inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter, is in development to treat cholestatic liver diseases. We describe the safety and tolerability of odevixibat in children with PFIC during the phase 3 PEDFIC 1 and PEDFIC 2 studies. Efficacy results from PEDFIC 1 and interim results from PEDFIC 2 have been previously presented: odevixibat improved pruritus, cholestasis, and growth with durable effect. Methods: In the double‐blind PEDFIC 1 study (NCT03566238), 62 children with PFIC (PFIC1: 27%; PFIC2: 73%) were randomised to placebo (Pbo; n=20), odevixibat 40 μg/kg/day (Odevix40; n=23), or odevixibat 120 μg/kg/day (Odevix120; n=19) for 24 weeks. PEDFIC 2, an ongoing, open‐label extension study (NCT03659916), enrolled either patients from PEDFIC 1 (ie, cohort 1) or new patients with any PFIC subtype (ie, cohort 2); a total of 69 patients (PFIC1: 26.1%; PFIC2: 65.2%; PFIC3: 7.2%; 1 patient with MYO5B variant: 1.4%) were included. Interim PEDFIC 2 data through July 15, 2020 are included here, covering data from 24 weeks of treatment with odevixibat 120 μg/kg/day. Standard safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), laboratory monitoring, and physical examinations. Patients with PFIC may have multiple comorbidities (eg, altered hepatic parameters, fatsoluble vitamin deficiencies, diarrhoea); therefore, these were examined as AEs of interest. Results: In PEDFIC 1, the incidence of drug‐related treatment‐emergent AEs (TEAEs) was 33.3% among all odevixibat‐treated patients and 15.0% with Pbo; drug‐related TEAEs of diarrhoea/frequent bowel movement occurred in 9.5% and 5.0%, respectively (Table). Only 1 patient discontinued study medication due to an AE (diarrhoea, Odevix120 arm). In PEDFIC 2, the incidence of drug‐related TEAEs was comparable in cohorts 1 and 2 (range: 26.3%‐31.3%). Overall, 20 of 69 patients (29%) experienced drug‐related TEAEs. The most common drug‐related TEAEs (Table) were laboratory abnormalities, including raised ALT and total bilirubin. One patient withdrew from PEDFIC 2 with an AE (worsening cholestasis) as the primary reason. No deaths or drug‐related serious AEs were reported in the 2 studies. Additionally, there were no clinically significant changes or safety signals noted in mean serum biochemistry, haematology, or urinalysis values based on laboratory assessments or physical examination; no events of liver decompensation; and no new events of fatsoluble vitamin deficiency refractory to clinically recommended vitamin supplementation. Overall, the incidence of gastrointestinal events, and specifically diarrhoea, was low: the majority of these events were mild to moderate in severity and self‐limiting. Conclusion: The observed safety and tolerability profile of odevixibat was consistent across studies, treatment groups, and doses, and there were no new or major safety findings. Odevixibat was generally well tolerated regardless of individual patient characteristics. The safety and tolerability profile of odevixibat supports its use as a potential non‐invasive treatment option for patients with PFIC, which could improve the standard of care in a disease with high unmet medical needs.",72,SUPPL 1,781‐782,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 635175516,,,,Journal article; Conference proceeding,*drug safety; *drug tolerability; *intrahepatic cholestasis; Adverse drug reaction; Alanine aminotransferase blood level; Biochemistry; Child; Clinical trial; Cohort analysis; Comorbidity; Conference abstract; Controlled study; Decompensated liver cirrhosis; Defecation; Diarrhea; Double blind procedure; Drug therapy; Female; Health care quality; Hematology; Human; Human tissue; Incidence; Major clinical study; Male; Non invasive procedure; Pharmacokinetics; Phase 3 clinical trial; Physical examination; Pruritus; Randomized controlled trial; Risk assessment; Side effect; Unmet medical need; Urinalysis; Vitamin deficiency; Vitamin supplementation,10.1097/MPG.0000000000003177,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02286068/full,

Methods: We selected 100 elderly patients with MDRB who received SAP in the hospital encephalology department from May 2011 to November 2014, and pathogenic detection and drug susceptibility tests were performed on the specimens sent for inspection. In addition, we observed the pathogenic characteristics of MDRB, and carried out univariate and multivariate regression analysis of related risk factors. The infected patients were randomly divided into a control group and an intervention group, each with 50 cases. The control group received routine nursing care, and the intervention group received targeted nursing interventions, and the nursing effect of the two groups of patients was compared and analyzed. Results: A total of 112 drug‐resistant bacteria were isolated from 100 SAP patients; gram‐positive bacteria accounted for 22.3%, gram‐negative bacteria accounted for 74.1%, fungi accounted for 3.6%. The multi‐factor analysis showed that SAP type, ICU admission, gastric catheter retention, length of hospital stay, prophylactic use of antibiotics and disturbance of consciousness are risk factors associated with MDRB. The total effective rate of the control group was 50.0%, and the total effective rate of the intervention group was 74.0%, the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P<0.05).

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei strain Shirota (LcS), formerly Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota, on constipation in patients with depression with specific etiology and gut microbiota and on depressive regimens. Eighty‐two patients with constipation were recruited. The subjects consumed 100 mL of a LcS beverage (108 CFU/mL) or placebo every day for 9 weeks. After ingesting beverages for this period, we observed no significant differences in the total patient constipation‐symptom (PAC‐SYM) scores in the LcS group when compared with the placebo group. However, symptoms/scores in item 7 (rectal tearing or bleeding after a bowel movement) and items 8–12 (stool symptom subscale) were more alleviated in the LcS group than in the placebo group. The Beck Depression Index (BDI) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores were all significantly decreased, and the degree of depression was significantly improved in both the placebo and LcS groups (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the groups.

Additionally, the interleukin (IL)‐1β, IL‐6, and tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) levels were significantly decreased in both the placebo and LcS groups (p < 0.05). In particular, the IL‐6 levels were significantly lower in the LcS group than the placebo group after the ingestion period (p < 0.05).

Objective: Is to describe this antibiotic misuse and its contributing factors. Also, to measure the pharmacists' application of infection preventive practices during the pandemic. Methods: A cross‐sectional study was conducted among randomly selected Egyptian community pharmacists (Center, East, Delta, and Upper Egypt) using a questionnaire and direct interviews from 1 to 30 August 2020. The questionnaire consisted of two parts, the first covered pharmacist's demographic data and their application of basic infection preventive practices (eg, wearing face masks, regular hand sanitization, etc), and the other part was related to antibiotic dispensing patterns. Data were descriptively analyzed and the impact of participant experience on the responses was evaluated using the χ2 test. Results: From 480 randomly selected Egyptian community pharmacists, 413 (87%) consented to participate in the study. 86.7% of the participants were keen to wear face masks (n = 358) and 86.2% kept regular hand sanitization (n = 356); whereas, 46.9% (n = 194) maintained adequate antibiotic stock supply during the pandemic.

Colonoscopy (endoscopic examination of the lower bowel) is a well‐established screening tool to identify lesions within the bowel and objectively assess the degree of inflammation present. Patients with IBD, both Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), have a higher risk of developing cancers of the bowel and it is for this reason that they undergo regular surveillance procedures. Guidelines recommend surveillance procedures using high definition white light endoscopy alongside either Dye‐Based Chromoendoscopy (DCE) or Virtual Chromoendoscopy (VCE), with targeted biopsies. However, the real world adoption of DCE and VCE is still modest. Due to technological advances there are alternative endoscopic imaging techniques that selectively enhance certain mucosal and vascular features, including narrow‐band imaging (NBI), i‐Scan optical enhancement (i‐Scan‐OE) and blue laser imaging (BLI). These technologies have been demonstrated to be more effective than standard white light endoscopy. Despite these advances in technology, detecting dysplasia within areas of inflammation due to IBD is challenging. An endoscopic classification was recently developed by Iacucci M et al called ""FACILE"" to characterise in detail the mucosal and vascular pattern to predict histological colonic lesions in IBD. Since traditional lesion assessment systems such as (unmodified) Kudo pit pattern are less reliable in IBD, there is a need for a robust scoring system to assist clinicians in detecting and characterising lesions in IBD. This project is to validate a training module on surveillance and colonic lesion characterisation in IBD. We aim to compare polyp detection in IBD surveillance procedures before and after training and evaluate the impact. As a sub‐study, an additional randomisation process will take place whereby one group will receive additional focused top‐up training and the other group will not. We will seek to compare the impact of feedback on knowledge retention. Study stages: ‐ Stage 1. Potential participants are provided an electronic PIS outlining the study. ‐ Stage 2. Participants consent to the study and complete the pre‐training assessment on REDCap (1 hour). ‐ Stage 3. Participants are provided with login details for online training. ‐ Stage 4. Participants complete the online training in their own time (1 hour). ‐ Stage 5. Participants complete the same assessment (as pre‐training) and are given 1‐2 weeks to complete this after training. ‐ Sub‐study: Participants are randomised 1:1 to either receive or not receive a short refresher training module (15 min). ‐ Stage 6. After 8‐12 weeks post‐training participants are invited to complete the same assessment process (as pre‐training). All participants will receive computer‐based training. Training will take place via an online computer‐ based self‐learning platform. The training will include reviewing short videos of colorectal polyps in patients with IBD and videos of inflammation in IBD (quiescent, mild, moderate and severe) using NBI, i‐Scan‐OE and BLI. Patients were consented for the use of the use of videos for educational purposes. Videos used have been fully anonymised. All Participants are given access to the secure REDCap platform hosted at the University of Birmingham. Participants will be required to register using a general survey to include their email address, anonymised demographic data, procedural experience and familiarity with optical endoscopic diagnosis platforms. Participants comprise three categories: novice, training endoscopist and experienced endoscopist. The latter two are the key categories for evaluation. ‐ Novice will include medical students and junior doctors/residents who have previously had no or little endoscopic experience. ‐ Training endoscopists will be gastroenterology and general surgery trainees/residents/fellows. ‐ Experienced endoscopists will be fully qualified endoscopists such as GI and general surgery staff, consultants and nurse endoscopists. Participants will then complete pre‐training assessment prior to e‐learning training. There are 26 video clips representative of different types of colonic lesions in IBD. Each video clip is typically 20‐30 seconds. The overall duration of the assessment is around one hour. Participants will then be given a login for the online training material and will complete this in their own time. Participants will be taught on endoscopic surveillance in IBD and how to characterise polyps accurately. The duration of the training module is 1 hour. It is interactive with optional components for tailored self‐directed learning. A post‐training assessment will be completed in the next 1‐2 weeks, using the same video clips, allowing us to compare the performance of participants before and after training. The assessment will be repeated after 8‐12 weeks to assess the retention of skills. An additional randomisation process on a 1:1 basis will take place, whereby one group will receive additional short refresher training following their responses to assessment questions and the other group will not.

This study aimed to identify the differences in gut bacterial community structure between LBW infants who received probiotics and LBW infants who did not receive probiotics. METHODS: Forty‐one infants were allocated to the non‐probiotic group (N group) and 56 infants to the probiotic group (P group), according to whether the formula they received contained a probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis. Gut bacterial composition was identified with sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in fecal samples collected at 14 days after birth. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the alpha diversity of the two groups, while the beta diversity was significantly different (p < 0.05). Our results showed that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (both p < 0.05) were enriched in the P group, while Veillonella, Dolosigranulum and Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (all p < 0.05) were enriched in the N group. Predicted metagenome function analysis revealed enhancement of fatty acids, peroxisome, starch, alanine, tyrosine and peroxisome pathways in the P group, and enhancement of plant pathogen, Salmonella and Helicobacter pylori infection pathways in the N group.

We evaluated whether formulation potency influences clinical and microbiome outcomes. Methods: In a 4‐week, randomized, double‐blind trial, 100 eligible adults received one of two higher‐dose multi‐strain probiotic formulations at different dosages (Wec120B vs Wec300B). Weekly Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) scores tracked symptom trajectories. Gut microbiota composition and diversity were profiled by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Biomarkers included lipopolysaccharide (LPS), fecal calprotectin (FC), and immunoglobulin A (IgA). Results: Results indicated that the Wec120B group showed more significant improvement in abdominal pain during the early phase of intervention, while the Wec300B group was more effective in relieving reflux symptoms. In terms of biomarkers, Wec120B was more effective in reducing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, whereas Wec300B showed a greater increase in immunoglobulin A (IgA) and a more pronounced reduction in fecal calprotectin (FC) levels. Both formulations significantly increased the abundance of beneficial genera such as Bifidobacterium, Blautia, [Eubacterium]_hallii_group, and Anaerostipes, while suppressing the growth of potential pathogens including Prevotella and Escherichia‐Shigella. Conclusions: These findings suggest that both compound probiotic products can significantly improve GI symptoms and modulate gut microbiota structure, with Wec300B showing a superior performance in microbial regulation, likely due to its higher dosage of probiotics.

Inflammatory bowel disease patients can have concurrent irritable bowel syndrome symptoms similar to those associated with a flare. The potential role of gut dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease provides a rationale for treating such patients with rifaximin. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of rifaximin in the management of irritable bowel syndrome‐like symptoms (bloating, abdominal pain, stool consistency) and quality of life in patients with Crohn's disease in remission.The present study included 86 patients with Crohn's disease in remission (fecal calprotectin <50 μg/g, C‐reactive protein <0.5 mg/dL, simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease <2) and associated irritable bowel syndrome‐like symptoms (bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea). These patients were randomly assigned to rifaximin treatment group (44 patients) and the control group (42 patients). Besides the baseline inflammatory bowel disease treatment and antispasmodics (as needed), patients in the rifaximin treatment group received 3 repeated courses of treatment, each course being represented by 1200 mg/d of rifaximin for 10 days and 20 days free of treatment (3 months consecutively); patients in the control group also received antispamodics as needed and were observed for 3 months.Monthly analyses of bloating score, abdominal pain score, stool consistency score, and quality of life score showed significant improvement after treatment in the rifaximin group in contrast with control group. Significantly more patients in the rifaximin group than in the control group met the criteria for adequate improvement of bloating score after 3 months of treatment (59.09% vs 19.04%, P = .01), adequate improvement of abdominal pain score (54.5% vs 21.4%, P = .04), stool consistency score (34.09% vs 14.2%, P = .03), and quality of life score (70.4% vs 21.4%, P < .001).Rifaximin in a dose of 1200 mg/d, 10 d/mo, 3 months consecutively is an effective medication for concurrent irritable bowel syndrome‐like symptoms in patients with Crohn's disease in remission.",100,1,e24059,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 33429768,EMBASE 634001454,,,,Journal article,"Abdominal Pain [drug therapy]; Abdominal pain /drug therapy; Adult; Complication; Crohn Disease [complications, *drug therapy]; Crohn disease /drug therapy; C‐Reactive Protein [analysis]; Drug effect; Endoscopy; Endoscopy [methods]; Feces; Female; Gastrointestinal Agents [pharmacology, standards, therapeutic use]; Human; Humans; Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex [analysis]; Male; Microbiota [drug effects]; Microflora; Middle Aged; Middle aged; Procedures; Remission; Remission, Spontaneous; Rifaximin [pharmacology, *standards, therapeutic use]",10.1097/MD.0000000000024059,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02251315/full,

Evidence‐based guidance is needed to inform interventions and future studies. Objectives: We aimed to estimate how sensitive the intervention effectiveness found in the WASH Benefits Bangladesh randomized controlled trial was to underlying WASH contextual and intervention factors (e.g.., baseline disease prevalence, compliance, community coverage, efficacy) and to generalize the results of the trial other contexts or scenarios. Methods: We developed a disease transmission model to account for transmission across multiple environmental pathways, multiple interventions (water (W), sanitation (S), hygiene (H), nutrition (N)) applied individually and in combination, adherence to interventions, and the impact of individuals not enrolled in the study. Leveraging a set of mechanistic parameter combinations fit to the WASH Benefits Bangladesh trial (n=17,187) using a Bayesian sampling approach, we simulated trial outcomes under counterfactual scenarios to estimate how changes in intervention completeness, coverage, compliance, and efficacy, as well as preexisting WASH conditions and baseline disease burden, impacted intervention effectiveness. Results: Increasing community coverage had the greatest impact on intervention effectiveness (e.g., median increases in effectiveness of 34.0 and 45.5% points in the WSH and WSHN intervention arms when increasing coverage to 20%). The effect of community coverage on effectiveness depended on how much transmission was along pathways not modified by the interventions. Intervention effectiveness was reduced by lower levels of preexisting WASH conditions or increased baseline disease burden. Individual interventions had complementary but not synergistic effects when combined. Discussion: To realize the expected health gains, future WASH interventions must address community coverage and transmission along pathways not traditionally covered by WASH. The effectiveness of individual‐level WASH improvements will be blunted the further the community is from the high community coverage needed to achieve herd protection.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 2021629373,,,,Preprint,*hygiene; *intervention study; *sanitation; *simulation; *water; Bangladesh; Child; Diarrhea; Disease burden; Evidence based practice; Human; Male; Patient compliance; Preprint; Prevalence; Prevention; Randomized controlled trial; Therapy,10.1101/2022.11.15.22282349,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02737437/full,

In Brazil, where the first cases were detected in 2014, it currently has reached all regions of this country and more than 900,000 cases were reported. The clinical spectrum of chikungunya ranges from an acute self‐limiting form to disabling chronic forms. The purpose of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of chikungunya infection in a large Brazilian city and investigate the association between viral circulation and living condition. Methodology/principal findings We conducted a population‐based ecological study in selected Sentinel Areas (SA) through household interviews and a serologic survey in 2016/2017. The sample was of 1,981 individuals randomly selected. The CHIKV seroprevalence was 22.1% (17.1 IgG, 2.3 IgM, and 1.4 IgG and IgM) and varied between SA from 2.0% to 70.5%. The seroprevalence was significantly lower in SA with high living conditions compared to SA with low living condition. There was a positive association between CHIKV seroprevalence and population density (r = 0.2389; p = 0.02033). Conclusions/significance The seroprevalence in this city was 2.6 times lower than the 57% observed in a study conducted in the epicentre of the CHIKV epidemic of this same urban centre. So, the herd immunity in this general population, after four years of circulation of this agent is relatively low. It indicates that CHIKV transmission may persist in that city, either in endemic form or in the form of a new epidemic, because the vector infestation is persistent. Besides, the significantly lower seroprevalences in SA of higher Living Condition suggest that beyond the surveillance of the disease, vector control and specific actions of basic sanitation, the reduction of the incidence of this infection also depends on the improvement of the general living conditions of the population.",15,4,e0009289,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 33878115,EMBASE 2007134931,,,,Journal article,"*chikungunya /epidemiology; Adolescent; Adult; Aedes aegypti; Aged; Antibodies, Viral [*blood]; Article; Brazil [epidemiology]; Chikungunya Fever [*epidemiology, immunology, transmission, *virology]; Chikungunya virus [*immunology]; Child; Child, Preschool; Communicable Diseases, Emerging [epidemiology, immunology, transmission, virology]; Disease Outbreaks; Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Epidemic; Female; Herd immunity; Household income; Human; Humans; Immunity, Herd; Immunoglobulin G [blood]; Immunoglobulin M [blood]; Incidence; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Population Surveillance; Population density; Prevalence; Sanitation; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Serology; Seroprevalence; Structured questionnaire; Virus transmission; Young Adult; Zika virus",10.1371/journal.pntd.0009289,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02274538/full,

The classical position of haemorrhoids corresponds to three positions which are the right anterior, right posterior and the left lateral areas of the anal canal. Haemorrhoids may be external or internal. External haemorrhoids are covered with skin and internal haemorrhoids are covered with anal mucous membranes. The grading system used by Banov to classify internal haemorrhoids is one of the most common grading systems used by clinicians and is used to guide therapeutic practice. Internal haemorrhoids can be divided into four categories depending on the degree of prolapse (the protrusion of the haemorrhoid through the anus). The most widely accepted classification is the Goligher classification : ‐ Bleeding but no prolapse (grade I). ‐ Hemorrhoidal piles prolapse through the anus during straining, but they reduce spontaneously (grade II). ‐ Hemorrhoidal piles prolapse through the anus during straining and require manual reduction (grade III). ‐ The prolapse is irreducible (grade IV). Most symptoms and signs which patients present with arise from internal haemorrhoids, derive from structural changes of the normal anatomic padding (enlarged internal haemorrhoids) and are generally associated with chronic straining either due to constipation, diarrhoea or prolonged periods trying to defecate. They are also common during pregnancy and childbirth. The acute clinical manifestation of the hemorrhoidal disease (commonly known as ""hemorrhoidal crisis"") is characterized by symptoms and signs, also common in chronic pathologies, such as rectal bleeding, prolapse, pruritus (itching), pain, oedema, often thrombosis, and less frequently soiling or mucoid discharge. Rectal bleeding (the most common presenting sign) is classically bright red as there is a high blood oxygen content within the arteriovenous anastomosis. This bleeding is usually described as bright red spotting on the toilet tissue or dripping in the toilet bowl and normally occurs at the end of defecation, separately from the stool. External haemorrhoids may be asymptomatic or associated with discomfort or with acute extreme pain in the event of a local thrombosis (formation of a clot). Phlebotonics are a heterogenous class of drugs consisting of plant extracts (i.e., flavonoids) and synthetic compounds. Although their precise mechanism of action has not been fully established, they are known to strengthen blood vessel walls, improve venous tone, stabilise capillary permeability and increase lymphatic drainage. They have been used to treat a variety of conditions including chronic venous insufficiency, lymphoedema and haemorrhoids. In particular, numerous trials assessing the effect of phlebotonics in treating the symptoms and signs of haemorrhoidal disease (they are generally used in the less severe stages of haemorrhoids, first and second‐grade haemorrhoids and during the thrombosis episodes) suggest that there is a potential benefit. Moreover, 2 reviews and 1 systematic review evaluated the micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) activities and performance in haemorrhoids. Based on the available clinical evidence, current national guidelines and extensive clinical experience in treating patients affected by the haemorrhoidal disease, MPFF can be administered as a first‐line treatment, in combination with diet (increased fibre and fluid intake) and lifestyle modifications, for acute grade I/II HD. A new micronized formulation of diosmin was incorporated in a new dietary supplement called Microsmin® Plus to increase plasma concentrations due to the property manufacturing process able to improve intestinal absorption following oral intake. This product has evidenced a better bioavailability compared with micronized diosmin in rats (4‐fold increased) and in healthy volunteers (19) (9.4 greater with higher plasmatic concentrations). Moreover, a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial carried out in patients with chronic venous disease (CVD) showed that the administration of a low dose of Microsmin® Plus is safe and effective in relieving symptoms and improving QoL in patients with CVD after 8 weeks of treatment. This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of phlebotonics (dietary supplement containing micronized diosmin, i.e., Microsmin® Plus) in alleviating the signs, symptoms and severity of haemorrhoidal disease in a set of standard clinical practices where the administration of phlebotonics is integrated with lifestyle counselling. Therefore, the Research Question of the present trial is the following: in a population of adult patients, men and women, suffering from symptomatic haemorrhoids, will the administration of the dietary supplement Microsmin® Plus (diosmin and micronized flavonoids) for 63 days (7‐days acute treatment phase + 55‐days maintenance phase), integrated with lifestyle counselling, improve the symptomatology (clinical signs and symptoms) in comparison with patients receiving placebo, results observed after 4, 7 and 63 days after the beginning of the treatment?",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT05750563,,,Trial registry record,Hemorrhoids,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02528712/full,

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of HDDT on the gut microbiota and compare it with that of bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT). METHODS: We enrolled outpatients (18‐70 years) diagnosed with Helicobacter pylori infection by either histology or a positive 13C‐urea breath test (13C‐UBT) and randomly assigned to either the BQT or HDDT group. Subjects consented to provide fecal samples which were collected at baseline, Week 2, and Week 14. Amplification of the V1 and V9 regions of the 16S rRNA was conducted followed by high‐throughput sequencing. RESULTS: Ultimately, 78 patients (41 patients in the HDDT group and 37 in the BQT group) were enrolled in this study. Eradication therapy significantly altered the diversity of the gut microbiota. However, the alpha diversity rebounded only in the HDDT group at 12 weeks post‐eradication. Immediately following eradication, the predominance of Proteobacteria, replacing commensal Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, did not recover after 12 weeks. Species‐level analysis showed that the relative abundances of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia fergusonii significantly increased in both groups at Week 2. Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis significantly increased in the BQT group, with no significant difference observed in the HDDT group. After 12 weeks of treatment, the relative abundance of more species in the HDDT group returned to baseline levels. CONCLUSION: Eradication of H. pylori can lead to an imbalance in gut microbiota.

To standardise the terminology used for BBD, LUTS symptoms related to the disease have been defined by International Children's Continence Society (ICCS). The prevalence of BBD is probably underestimated but studies suggest BBD to be present in up to 20 % of school children and to represent up to 40% of paediatric urology consults. Embryological, anatomical and functional interactions between the rectum and urinary bladder are well known. Bladder and bowel are anatomically closely related and share innervation from the parasympathetic S2‐S4 and sympathetic L1‐L3 nerve roots. Research on successful treatment of BBD is sparse, with only few retrospective, non‐randomized studies, documenting that treatment of defecation problems in children with BBD enhances successful management of lower urinary tract disturbances such as daytime urinary incontinence (DUI), enuresis and urinary tract infections (UTI's). Based on this knowledge and clinical experience, the present treatment strategy for children with BBD is a step‐wise approach starting with management of bowel symptoms before initiation of standard urotherapy and further medical treatment of LUTS symptoms. Standard urotherapy encompasses information and demystification of the disorder along with behavioural modification such as timed voiding, proper voiding posture, avoidance of holding manoeuvers and balanced fluid intake. Standard urotherapy is well‐established as first‐line treatment for children with LUTS. However, high‐level evidence of the succession of the elements in treatment of BBD children is missing. BBD is commonly associated with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and recurrent UTI's, which may lead to renal scarring , kidney failure and hypertension. It is a potential cause of significant physical and psychosocial burden for children and families. Therefore, optimization of treatment is critical to avoid secondary comorbidities. Our microbiome, and its role in health and disease, has gained increased focus during the past few years. Studies suggest the urine and gut microbiome to be critical for maintenance of a well‐functioning bladder‐ and bowel system. Dysbiosis is defined by the presence of unbalanced and disease‐promoting composition of the microbiome. It is well‐established that dysbiosis is associated with constipation in children and the condition is suspected to be involved in urological disorders such as overactive bladder, urge, incontinence and recurrent UTI's in adults. However, the composition of the urine microbiome in children is only sparsely investigated and its role in BBD and childhood UTI's is to the investigator's knowledge still unexplored. Study 1: Does successful treatment of bowel symptoms resolve urinary incontinence in children with BBD? Aim and hypothesis Aim: To investigate if effective treatment of bowel problems resolves urinary incontinence in BBD children. The hypothesis of the investigators is: 1. Treatment of bowel symptoms resolves urinary incontinence in BBD children. 2. It is more effective to initiate urotherapy from the beginning in combination with treatment of bowel symptoms instead of the present regime where bowel symptoms are managed before urotherapy is started. 3. Succesful treatment of urinary incontinence in children with BBD improves their quality of life. 1.2 Materials and methods A prospective multicentre randomised study on children with BBD referred to the Pediatric Incontinence and Gastroenterology outpatient clinics at the Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aalborg University Hospital and Regional Hospital Goedstrup. Children (n=100) between 5‐14 years and 9 months diagnosed with BBD at their first visit to the outpatient clinic will be included if they meet in‐ and exclusion criteria. The included children will be randomised to one of the following treatments: 1. Medical treatment of bowel symptoms in accordance with the guidelines of The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) (n=50) 2. Medical treatment of bowel symptoms in accordance with the ESPGHAN guidelines combined with standard urotherapy (n=50) At first visit to the outpatient clinic, enrolled children will undergo physical examination including neurological examination. Data on medical history will be collected including number of and time for UTI's. Participants will be asked to fill in a 48‐hour flow‐volume chart and in case of enuresis nocturna the chart will also include registration for 7 nights. Participants will also fill in ""Toerfisk"" which is a validated tool to monitor severity of urinary incontinence. Routine uroflowmetry will be performed for further evaluation of lower urinary symptoms. A urine sample will be collected for diagnosing on‐going UTI and for microbiome analysis in study 3. The children will be screened for constipation in accordance with the ROME IV criteria. Rectal examination will be performed or transrectal diameter will be evaluated with point‐of‐care ultrasound. Stool sample and perineum swab will be collected for microbiome analysis. The psychological burden from the children´s BBD condition will be evaluated by PinQ, a validated questionnaire used for assessment of quality of life according to the incontinence issue of the patients. All participants will be informed about bladder and bowel function in order to demystify the disorder. Daily defecation will be induced by reconditioning to normal bowel habits through timed toilet sitting and daily administration of laxatives (e.g. PEG3350) in relevant dosage according to the ESPGHAN guidelines. Participants randomized to combined medical treatment for bowel symptoms and urotherapy will be instructed in urotherapy in accordance with earlier description. After 1 month of treatment the participants will be contacted by telephone to ensure compliance and for adjustment of laxative dose depending on the bowel symptoms. The second visit in the outpatient clinic will be after 3 months of treatment. Before the consultation, the participants will be asked to fill in a second flow‐volume chart as well as ""Toerfisk"" and PinQ questionnaires. Uroflowmetry will be repeated and a second urine sample will be collected for stix, culturing and microbiome analysis. Bowel symptoms will be evaluated using ROME IV, rectal examination and transrectal diameter and a second stool sample and perineum swab will be collected for microbiome analysis for study 3. Data storage Data will be entered into RedCap, which is a secure web platform for building and managing online databases. Power estimation The sample size (n=100) was calculated for each group to achieve a power of 80% for detecting a difference in proportions of 0.30 between the two groups (test ‐ reference group) at a two sided p‐value of 0.05. Study 2: Urine, perineal and gut microbiome in children with BBD before and after treatment Aim and hypothesis To investigate the urine, perineal and gut microbiome in children with BBD before and after treatment. The hypothesis of the investigators is that 1. Response to treatment can be predicted by the composition of the urine, perineal and gut microbiome in children with BBD. 2. The composition of the urine, perineal and gut microbiome is different in BBD children with recurrent UTI's compared to BBD children without recurrent UTI's. 3. The urine, perineal and gut microbiome in children with BBD will change when bladder and bowel symptoms successfully treated. Materials and methods The study is a multicentre study consisting of two elements: 1. a cohort study to investigate, whether the urine, perineal and gut microbiome can predict response to treatment and whether it changes during treatment period 2. a case control study to investigate whether the urine, perineal and gut microbiome is different in children with BBD and recurrent UTI 's and children with BBD without recurrent UTI 's. The study population consists of children with BBD included in study 1. Collection and analysis of samples A urine‐, stool sample and a perineum swab will be collected from all participants before initiation of treatment and after 3 months of treatment as described in study 1. Bacterial DNA will be extracted and the microbiome will be determined. Data storage Biological material will be pseudonymised and stored in a ‐80 degree fridge until analysis is performed. Statistical analysis for all 3 studies Distribution and variance will be analysed by QQ plot, Shapiro‐Wilks test and Bartletts test. Microbiota alpha‐diversity will be addressed by ASV richness, Faith's phylogenetic diversity, Shannon diversity index, and Pielou's evenness index. Beta‐diversity analysis will include principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) using Bray‐Curtis dissimilarity, weighted and unweighted UniFrac. Parametric data will be compared using Student's t‐test or one‐way ANOVA and Tukey´s post hoc test, while non‐parametric data will be compared with Kruskal‐Wallis test or Mann‐Whitney U‐test. Chi Squared test will be used for proportions. Level of significance will be as following *: p <0.05, **: p<0.01 and ***: p<0.001. Ethics The studies will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All side effects will be handled in accordance with the actual legislation. No risk or unknown side effects are expected to urotherapy or medical treatment of bowel symptoms. No risk, side effects or discomfort is expected from collection of urine, stool and perineum samples or from uroflowmetry or transabdominal ultrasound. Perspectives BBD is a common condition in childhood. It is associated with a considerable psychological burden and a risk of more severe physical complications. The term BBD is recently defined and therefore only sparsely investigated. The studies will provide basic knowledge about characteristics of the BBD patients and contribute new information about the optimal treatment of BBD children.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT05318365,,,Trial registry record,Gastrointestinal Diseases; Intestinal Diseases; Polyethylene glycol 3350,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02392293/full,

There are currently no licensed vaccines for shigellosis but it has been estimated that an effective vaccine could avert 590,000 deaths over a 20‐year period. A challenge to effective Shigella vaccine development has been the low immunogenicity and protective efficacy of candidate Shigella vaccines in infants and young children. Additionally, a new vaccine might be less immunogenic in a highly endemic setting compared to a low endemic setting (""vaccine hyporesponsiveness""). The use of a potent adjuvant enhancing both mucosal and systemic immunity might overcome these problems. InvaplexAR‐Detox is an injectable Shigella vaccine that uses a novel combination of conserved invasion plasmid antigen proteins and a serotype‐specific bacterial lipopolysaccharide attenuated for safe intramuscular administration. The adjuvant dmLT has been shown to enhance Shigella immune responses in mice, has safely been administered intramuscularly, and was shown to enhance immune responses in healthy volunteers when given in combination with other antigens in phase I trials. This article describes the protocol of a study that will be the first to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of InvaplexAR‐Detox co‐administered with dmLT in healthy adults in low‐endemic and high‐endemic settings. METHODS: In a multi‐center, randomized, double‐blind, and placebo‐controlled dose‐escalation phase Ia/b trial, the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of three intramuscular vaccinations administered 4 weeks apart with 2.5 µg or 10 µg of InvaplexAR‐Detox vaccine, alone or in combination with 0.1 µg of the dmLT adjuvant, will first be assessed in a total of 50 healthy Dutch adults (phase Ia) and subsequently in 35 healthy Zambian adults (phase Ib) aged 18‐50 years. The primary outcome is safety, and secondary outcomes are humoral and cellular immune responses to the adjuvanted or non‐adjuvanted vaccine. DISCUSSION: This trial is part of the ShigaPlexIM project that aims to advance the early clinical development of an injectable Shigella vaccine and to make the vaccine available for late‐stage clinical development. This trial addresses the issue of hyporesponsiveness in an early stage of clinical development by testing the vaccine and adjuvant in an endemic setting (Zambia) after the first‐in‐human administration and the dose‐escalation has proven safe and tolerable in a low‐endemic setting (Netherlands). Besides strengthening the vaccine pipeline against a major diarrheal disease, another goal of the ShigaPlexIM project is to stimulate capacity building and strengthen global North‐South relations in clinical research.

Patients and Methods: A total of 150 rectal cancer patients who underwent surgical treatment in our hospital from July 2022 to July 2023 were selected and randomly divided into two groups using a random number table. There were 75 cases in the control group (CG) who underwent traditional open rectal total mesorectal excision surgery and 75 cases in the experimental group (EG) who underwent LGTME. The surgical effects of the two groups were compared, and the gastrointestinal and anal functional recovery of the two groups were compared before and after treatment. Results: Intraoperative bleeding, incision length, time to initial feeding and time to anal exhaust in the EG were significantly lower than those in the CG (P < 0.05). Before treatment, there was no significant difference in gastrointestinal function and anal function between the two groups (P > 0.05). After treatment, the levels of motilin, gastrin, neuropeptide Y and basic fibroblast growth factor in the EG were significantly higher than those in the CG, with statistical significance (P < 0.05); the maximum anal systolic pressure and resting anal sphincter pressure in the EG were significantly lower than those in the CG (P < 0.05); the rectal sensitivity threshold volume (RSTV) and rectal maximum volume threshold in the EG were significantly higher than those in the CG (P < 0.05).

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of B. infantis NLS‐SS on persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with CD following a long‐term GFD. We conducted a randomised, cross‐over, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in symptomatic adult CD patients on a GFD for at least two years. After one‐week run‐in, patients were randomised to B. infantis NLS‐SS or placebo for 3 weeks with cross‐over after a 2‐week wash‐out period. We estimated changes (Δ) in celiac symptom index (CSI) before and after treatment. Stool samples were collected for faecal microbiota analysis (16S rRNA sequencing). Gluten immunogenic peptide (GIP) excretion in stool and urine samples was measured at each study period. Eighteen patients were enrolled; six patients were excluded due violations in protocol. For patients with the highest clinical burden, CD symptoms were lower in probiotic than in placebo treatment (P=0.046). B. infantis and placebo treated groups had different microbiota profiles as assessed by beta diversity clustering. In probiotic treated groups, we observed an increase in abundance of B. infantis. Treatment with B. infantis was associated with decreased abundance of Ruminococcus sp. and Bifidobacterium adolescentis. GIP excretion in stools and urine was similar at each treatment period. There were no differences in adverse effects between the two groups. B. infantis NLS‐SS improves specific CD symptoms in a subset of highly symptomatic treated patients (GFD). This is associated with a shift in stool microbiota profile. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

METHODS: We conducted a causal mediation analysis using data collected between September 2013 and October 2015 from a cohort nested within the WASH Benefits Bangladesh cluster‐randomized trial (NCT01590095). Among a subsample of children within the WASH, nutrition, nutrition + WASH, and control arms (N = 1409 children; 267 clusters), we recorded caregiver‐reported antibiotic use at ages 14 and 28 months and collected stool at age 14 months. Our primary outcome was any caregiver‐reported antibiotic use by index children within the past 30 or 90 days measured at age 14 and 28 months. Mediators included caregiver‐reported child diarrhea, acute respiratory infection (ARI), and fever; and enteric pathogen carriage in stool measured by qPCR. Both intervention‐mediator and mediator‐outcome models were controlled for mediator‐outcome confounders. FINDINGS: The receipt of any WASH or nutrition intervention reduced caregiver‐reported antibiotic use through all pathways in the past month by 5.5 percentage points (95% CI 1.2, 9.9), from 49.5% (95% CI 45.9%, 53.0%) in the control group to 45.0% (95% CI 42.7%, 47.2%) in the pooled intervention group. When separating this effect into different pathways, we found that interventions reduced antibiotic use by 0.6 percentage points (95% CI 0.1, 1.3) through reduced diarrhea, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI 0.1, 1.5) through reduced ARI with fever, and 1.5 percentage points (95% CI 0.4, 3.0) through reduced prevalence of enteric viruses. Interventions reduced antibiotic use through any of these measured mediators by 2.1 percentage points (95% CI ‐0.3, 4.5). INTERPRETATION: WASH and nutrition interventions reduced pediatric antibiotic use through the prevention of enteric and respiratory infections in a rural, low‐income population. Given that many of these infections are caused by viruses or parasites, WASH and nutrition interventions may help reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in similar settings.

CN-02249917,"NCT04797936,",BNO 1030 Extract (Imupret) in the Treatment of Mild Forms of COVID-19,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04797936,2021,"The new coronavirus (2019‐nCoV) from Wuhan is currently of great concern, as the virus is spreading rapidly around the world and the number of cases and deaths is constantly growing. The main cause of death is the severe course of COVID‐19 disease, which includes pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and septic shock. As the spread of COVID‐19 is progressing worldwide, the focus is on the rapid identification, testing, and treatment of patients with severe COVID‐19 and the hospitalization of people with the highest risk of fatal outcomes. Less attention is paid to cases of mild disease. According to WHO data, about 40% of patients with COVID‐19 have a mild course of the disease, namely, cases of mild course are of great danger from the point of view of the spread of infection, since the main source of infection is a sick person. An infected person, even with minor clinical symptoms, can infect between 1.5 and 3.5 people and spread the virus among approximately 368 people in just five infection cycles. The mild course of COVID‐19 is characterized by a number of nonspecific symptoms: fever, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, malaise, headache, muscle pain. Evidence has emerged of loss of smell as a symptom of COVID‐19 infection. South Korea, China, and Italy have already proven that a significant number of patients with proven COVID‐19 infection developed anosmia/hyposmia. In Germany, more than 2 out of 3 confirmed cases are reported to have anosmia. Anosmia/hyposmia in the absence of other respiratory diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, acute rhinosinusitis, or chronic rhinosinusitis, are considered as a clinical marker of COVID‐19 infection in a pandemic. For people with a mild course of the disease, WHO recommends providing home care, and the recommendations come down to observing a sanitary‐hygienic regimen and taking antipyretics if necessary. Unfortunately, the treatment of patients with a mild course is still outside the interest of medical science. However, in its updated strategy to curb the spread of COVID‐19, WHO states the need for diagnosis, effective isolation, and treatment of patients with mild to moderate severity of the clinical course of patients. Fever, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, malaise, headache, muscle pain, and decreased sense of smell are typical symptoms of acute nasopharyngitis. It is believed that the previously described coronaviruses account for 10‐15% of cases of nasopharyngitis, so it is not surprising that the new COVID‐19 virus can also cause anosmia in infected patients. These patients need isolation and treatment because they are covert carriers that contribute to the rapid spread of COVID‐19. Currently, there is experience with the use of the drug Imupret for the treatment of nasopharyngitis associated with other viral pathogens, in particular Epstein‐Barr virus. It was shown that the use of a Phyto preparation helps to accelerate the regression of symptoms characteristic of nasopharyngitis, as well as accelerate the elimination of the virus from the body. Obviously, the proven activity of Imupret is important in relation to the activation of factors of nonspecific immunity, which is important in confronting viruses, including COVID‐19. Another obvious factor that is important for the treatment of viral diseases is the synergism of the active substances in oak bark and walnut leaves with respect to inhibition of reverse transcriptase of a wide range of respiratory viruses, as well as the anti‐inflammatory effect of the drug. Confirmation of the therapeutic effect of Imupret for the treatment of nasopharyngitis associated with COVID‐19 would allow the development of new therapeutic tools to combat this infection and put into practice updated WHO emphasis on national health systems: it is important to identify, treat and isolate all cases of COVID‐19, including cases with mild or moderate severity of the disease.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT04797936,,,Trial registry record,Myalgia; Nasopharyngitis; Olfaction Disorders,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02249917/full,ENT
CN-02405033,"NCT05378880,",Optimising Community Antibiotic Use and Infection Control With Behavioural Interventions in Burkina Faso and DR Congo,https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT05378880,2022,"Background A major driver of AMR emergence in LMICs is community‐ and individual‐level antibiotic consumption, which have both been associated with an increased risk of acquisition of AMR bacteria for individuals in the general community. As a result of difficult or delayed access to hospitals and formal health centres, the principal sources of antibiotics in many LMIC communities are medicine stores, i.e. community pharmacies or informal medicine vendors. Staff at these outlets are frequently not medically qualified, and informal selling of medicines is common. Two recent systematic reviews estimated the pooled prevalence of reported self‐medication with antibiotics in LMICs at 78%, in sSA at 56%, and in West‐Africa at 70%. Furthermore, in sSA, over two thirds of visits to community medicine stores were found to result in dispensing prescription‐free antibiotics. Appropriately trained and motivated pharmacy staff can be part of a successful AMR control programme, in particular through their role in educating patients, promoting appropriate usage of dispensed antibiotics, and providing guidance to healthcare colleagues on appropriate antibiotic prescribing. In the absence of a clinical or microbiological diagnosis, medicine stores often dispense antibiotics without a clear rationale. Importantly, these antibiotic courses frequently consist of Watch antibiotics. Among the different types of providers listed, and even among those with a good understanding of AMR, there is a need for supporting appropriate antibiotic prescription practices. A recent study in 6 LMICs showed that context‐specific tailored intervention packages are key to improve community antibiotic use. In any stewardship programme targeting unregulated community dispensing of antibiotics, it is therefore crucial to co‐develop interventions with medicine stores, and to incorporate the identification of alternative (economic) incentives, as well as targeting communities, to enable sustainable take‐up by both medicine stores and their communities. Existing behavioural change interventions have been categorised as persuasive (eg. peer‐to‐peer feedback on dispensing), enabling (eg. guidelines, training sessions), restrictive (eg. expert approval before dispensing some specific antibiotics) or structural (eg. introducing a clinical algorithm). The effect of individual interventions targeting outpatient dispensing of antibiotics in LMIC has been heterogeneous, with multi‐faceted interventions combining educational material with audits and feedback or peer‐to‐peer comparisons more effective at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use than stand‐alone interventions.This project proposes a robust participatory‐driven behaviour change intervention to reduce the use of Watch antibiotics from medicine stores, targeting both the demand (community) and supply (medicine store) side, and to reduce emergence and transmission of AMR. To develop locally acceptable, feasible and relevant interventions, the COM‐B model for behaviour change has been found highly suitable. This model forms the centre of the well‐known Behaviour Change Wheel which is widely used in designing interventions and has been used by NICE and the UK Department of Health. COM‐B identifies three essential conditions for behaviour ‐ capability, opportunity, motivation ‐ which thereby provide intervention opportunities for behaviour change. Capabilities include psychological (e.g. knowledge) and physical (e.g. skills) capabilities. Opportunity includes social and physical opportunities (e.g. social influences and environmental context and resources). Motivation includes reflective and automatic motivation such as beliefs about capabilities and consequences, goals, and ideas about professional role and identity. The intervention bundle in this study therefore aims to address AMR using three intervention components which each address the three conditions of behaviour change of the COM‐B model. Target behaviours for the intervention are based upon considerations around impact potential, likelihood for change, potential spill‐over effects as well as ease of measurement. The COM‐B model would thus be highly suitable to guide ABU interventions addressing highly complex behaviour, and will be used to design the intervention bundles to achieve a joint change in antibiotic demand and supply. At the same time, ongoing transmission of newly emerging or existing (drug‐resistant) bacteria and the exchange of AMR genes between bacteria harboured by human hosts, animals and their environment, is facilitated by substandard hygiene and sanitation practices. Household transmission was recently found to be a more important mode of bacterial strain sharing than transmission from livestock in urban Nairobi. The widespread environmental rummaging behaviour of rodents implies that they can serve as a proxy for AMR prevalence in the natural environment . This is of major relevance in settings where sewage surveillance, an alternative measurement to estimate environmental prevalence, may not (yet) be feasible because of the absence of sufficient sewage systems. Study objectives Primary 1. Develop, implement, and evaluate the effect of a behavioural intervention bundle targeting medicine stores (including community pharmacies and informal medicine sellers), and the surrounding populations on (Watch) antibiotic use. 2.

The gut microbiota of CS‐born babies differs to those born vaginally, possibly due to reduced exposure to maternal vaginal bacteria during birth. Vaginal seeding is a currently unproven practice intended to reduce such differences, so that the gut microbiota of CS‐born babies is similar to that of babies born vaginally. Our pilot study, which uses oral administration as a novel form of vaginal seeding, will assess the degree of maternal strain transfer and overall efficacy of the procedure for establishing normal gut microbiota development. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Protocol for a single‐blinded, randomized, placebo‐controlled pilot study of a previously untested method of vaginal seeding (oral administration) in 30 CS‐born babies. A sample of maternal vaginal bacteria is obtained prior to CS, and mixed with 5 ml sterile water to obtain a supernatant. Healthy babies are randomized at 1:1 to receive active treatment (3 ml supernatant) or placebo (3 ml sterile water). A reference group of 15 non‐randomized vaginal‐born babies are also being recruited. Babies' stool samples will undergo whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing to identify potential differences in community structure between CS babies receiving active treatment compared to those receiving placebo at age 1 month (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes include differences in overall gut community between CS groups (24 hours, 3 months); similarity of CS‐seeded and placebo gut profiles to vaginally‐born babies (24 hours, 1 and 3 months); degree of maternal vaginal strain transfer in CS‐born babies (24 hours, 1 and 3 months); anthropometry (1 and 3 months) and body composition (3 months). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval by the Northern A Health and Disability Ethics Committee (18/NTA/49). Results will be published in peer‐reviewed journals and presented at international conferences.

The aim of this work was designed to assess the role of probiotics (Lactobacillus casei Zhang, Bifidobactetium animalis subsp. lactis V9, and Lactobacillus plantarum P‐8) in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. METHODS: Thirty three patients with hyperlipidemia were randomly divided into a probiotic group (n = 18) and a control group (n = 15). The probiotic group was administered probiotics (2 g once daily) and atorvastatin 20 mg (once daily), and the control group was administered a placebo (2 g once daily) and atorvastatin 20 mg (once daily). Serum and fecal samples were gathered for subsequent analyses. RESULTS: Time had a significant effect on the total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels in the probiotic and control groups (P < .05). The gut microbial abundance in the probiotic group was markedly higher than that in the control group following 3‐month probiotic treatment (P < .05). At the phylum level, probiotics exerted no notable effects on the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria but elevated that of Tenericutes and reduced Proteobacteria. At the genus level, probiotics increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Akkermansia, and decreased that of Escherichia, Eggerthella, and Sutterella relative to the control group in months 1, 2, and 3 (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics optimize the gut microbiota structure and decrease the amount of harmful bacteria in patients with hyperlipidemia. Probiotics can influence the composition of gut microorganisms and increase their diversity and abundance in vivo.

Although the precise cause remains unknown, disturbances in the intestinal microbial community have been linked to its pathogenesis. Randomized controlled trials in UC and relapsing Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) have established fecal microbiota (FM) transfer (FMT) as an effective therapy. In this context, preliminary results indicated that the transfer of sterile fecal microbiota filtrates (<0.2 μm; FMF, FMFT) of donor stool also drives gastrointestinal microbiota changes and eliminates symptoms in CDI patients. However, along with the success of FMT, regulatory agencies issued safety alerts following reports of serious adverse events due to transmission of enteric pathogens through FMT. To reduce this risk, we established an extensive test protocol for our donors and quarantine regulations for the produced capsules, but alternative concepts are desirable. METHODS: Our project is a randomized, controlled, longitudinal, prospective, three‐arm, multicenter, double‐blind study to determine the safety and efficacy of repeated long‐term, multi‐donor FM or FMF transfers compared to placebo using oral, frozen capsules in 174 randomized patients with mild to moderate active UC. The primary outcome will be clinical remission at week 12. DISCUSSION: This proposal aims to examine (a) the efficacy of encapsulated transfer of FM and FMF as a therapy for mild to moderate UC, (b) the short‐ and long‐term safety of FMT and FMFT in patients with UC, and (c) the microbial and immunologic changes that occur after FMT and FMFT to help understand how and why it affects inflammatory bowel disease.

Hand hygiene (HH) interventions play a critical role in reducing HH‐related diseases, and the inclusion of all stakeholders in such interventions has improved the success of such interventions. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of an HH intervention on the behaviour, practices, and health of parents of preschool children. METHODOLOGY: Seventeen preschools were randomly selected and placed into intervention (IG = 8) and control groups (CG = 9). Parents (N = 191) were requested to complete questionnaires both pre‐ and postintervention. An intervention was applied to IG preschool respondents. The data were analysed and compared pre‐ and postintervention between IG and CG. RESULTS: Parents of IG showed a significant difference pre‐ and postintervention in HH practices such as washing hands after coughing and sneezing, and after using the toilet while parents in CG also indicated significant differences in HH practices of washing hands after coughing and sneezing, and after wiping children's noses. Postintervention, IG families reporting runny tummies were significantly less than pre‐intervention and a decrease in doctor's visits. There was a 5% improvement of all HH practices in both IG and CG. CONCLUSION: Over 90% of parents in both groups washed hands after using the toilet, both pre‐ and postintervention. All HH practices for both groups showed increases both pre‐ and postintervention.

UTI symptoms in infants are nonspecific. Therefore, it is important to take a good urine specimen for diagnosis. In practice, different techniques are used to collect urine specimen. These techniques are suprapubic aspiration, urinary catheterization, sterile urine collection bag, and cleanly caught urine. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends collecting urine specimen by suprapubic aspiration (SPA) and urinary catheterization methods for the diagnosis of UTI. The sterile urine collection bag is a non‐invasive urine collection technique. This technique is both time consuming and the urine obtained has high bacterial contamination. (Kaufman 2020). Clean‐caught urine provides an acceptable urine specimen for the diagnosis of UTI. However, this technique is possible for toilet‐trained children (Roberts et al. 2016). Recently, Herreros Fernández et al. (2013) described a clean‐caught urine collection technique based on bladder stimulation and lumbar paravertebral massage. This technique was successful in 86% of newborns, with an average duration of 57 seconds. When the literature is reviewed, more evidence is needed regarding the bladder stimulation technique in children without toilet training. Examining the effects of parasympathetic system stimulating maneuvers on children's physiological parameters and pain will contribute to more knowledge about the technique. This study will be conducted to investigate the effect of non‐invasive bladder stimulation technique on the success of the procedure, the duration of the procedure, the physiological parameters and the level of pain in collecting urine specimens in infants under the age of one. Study Population and Sampling: The study population will consist of infants without toilet training, who applied to the Pediatric Emergency Service of a university hospital and whose urine specimen should be collected for diagnostic purposes.The sample of the study will consist of 64 infants (Experimental group=32, Control group=32) under the age of one who applied to the Pediatric Emergency Service of a university hospital, met the criteria for inclusion in the study, and received written consent from their parents. In calculating the sample size, Altuntaş et al. (2015) benefited from the study. Considering the success rates; The minimum number of samples to be taken was determined as 64 (Experimental group=32, Control group=32) with 95% confidence (1‐α), 95% test power (1‐β), w=0.453 effect size. Randomization: Infants who meet the research sample selection criteria will be assigned to the experimental and control groups using the balanced block randomization method. Tran et al (2016) reported increasing age in children as a factor affecting the success of the procedure. For this reason, the block randomization method will be preferred in order to ensure that the infants are distributed homogeneously according to the age groups. In order to assign infants to the experimental and control groups, 4 blocks will be created on the computer (www.random.org) according to age (1‐3 months, 4‐6 months, 7‐9 months, 10‐12 months). Each block will contain 16 (8 experimental, 8 control) babies. Data Collection Method The data will be collected by the researcher in the unit where the study is planned to be carried out. Data Collection Tools Data Collection Form: Prepared by the researcher. The form includes questions about the infant's age, weight, gender, whether he is circumcised if male, fever, heartbeat, saturation level, FLACC scale score, and procedure success and duration of the procedure. The FLACC Pain Scale was developed by Merkel et al in 1997. Five behavioral parameters are evaluated on the FLACC scale. Each of the baby's facial expression, leg movements, activity, crying, and comfortability parameters take the value 0, 1, 2. The total score is between 0 and 10 (Merkel et al. 1997). The Turkish validity and reliability of the scale was performed by Şenaylı et al.(2006). Pulse Oximeter Device to detect the oxygen saturation (SPO2) and heart rate (HR) of infants before, during and after the procedure Intervention The bladder stimulation technique consists of two consecutive maneuvers. In the first maneuver, the bladder is stimulated by tapping the suprapubic region for 30 seconds at a frequency of 100 touches per minute. In the second maneuver, circular massage is applied to the paravertebral region for 30 seconds. The two stimulation maneuvers will be repeated alternately for 3 minutes (180 seconds) until micturition begins. Maneuvers will be performed by the researcher. Infants in both groups will be held under the armpit by a parent, male infants will be held in the drooping legs, and female infants will be held in the hip flexion position. Bladder stimulation technique will be applied to the experimental group, but not to the control group. Interventions to be applied to the experimental group: ‐ Breastmilk/formula milk/water intake appropriate for the infant's age and weight will be provided 20‐30 minutes before the urine specimen is taken. ‐ Before the procedure, information about the infant in the data collection form will be recorded. ‐ Before the procedure, the infant 's heart rate, saturation level and Flacc scale score will be recorded. Scoring of the FLACC pain scale will be done by the researcher and a nurse who is not part of the research team. ‐ Genital area will be cleaned before taking urine specimen. ‐ İnfant will be held under the armpit by a parent, baby boys will be held with their legs hanging down, and baby girls will be held in hip flexion position. ‐ Infants with spontaneous voiding during the period from the beginning of the research procedure until the infant is positioned will be excluded from the study.

Less is known about the short‐ and long‐term effects of FMT on larger panels of ARGs. We analyzed 226 pre‐ and post‐treatment stool samples from a randomized placebo‐controlled trial of FMT in 100 patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation or receiving anti‐leukemia induction chemotherapy for 47 ARGs. These patients have heavy antibiotic exposure and a high incidence of colonization with multidrug‐resistant organisms. Samples from each patient spanned a period of up to 9 months, allowing us to describe both short‐ and long‐term effects of FMT on ARGs, while the randomized design allowed us to distinguish between spontaneous changes vs. FMT effect. We find an overall bimodal pattern. In the first phase (days to weeks after FMT), low‐level transfer of ARGs largely associated with commensal healthy donor microbiota occurs. This phase is followed by long‐term resistance to new ARGs as stable communities with colonization resistance are formed after FMT. The clinical implications of these findings are likely context‐dependent and require further research.

AIMS: The present study aimed to evaluate some of these factors. METHODS: This study included 186 patients with IBS randomized 1:1:1 into transplant administered to the colon (single LI), to the duodenum (single SI), or to the duodenum twice with a 1‐week interval (repeated SI). The patients provided a fecal sample and were asked to complete five questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after FMT. The fecal bacteria composition and dysbiosis index (DI) were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene PCR DNA amplification/probe hybridization covering regions V3‐V9. RESULTS: The response rate was significantly higher in single SI than in single LI at 12 months after FMT. Symptoms and quality of life improved in all the treated groups at all time intervals after FMT. The abdominal symptoms were significantly reduced and the quality of life improved for repeated SI compared with for single SI. DI significantly decreased in all the treated groups at all observation times after FMT. The bacterial profiles changed in all groups at all observation intervals. However, these changes differed between single LI and single SI/repeated SI. CONCLUSION: Administrating transplant to the small intestine had a long‐term higher response rate than that administrated to the large intestine, and led to long‐term colonization of beneficial bacteria. Repeating FMT had more effect on symptoms and quality of life than a single FMT. (www.

A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized pilot trial,Journal of travel medicine,2023,"BACKGROUND: Blastocystis sp. is a worldwide‐distributed protist colonizing the guts of humans and a great variety of animals. It is unclear whether it is just a commensal or an infectious parasite that prompts eradication.The main objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of metronidazole in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms harbouring only Blastocystis sp. In addition, we explored whether Blastocystis subtype or concomitant parasitic infection detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may influence treatment outcome. METHODS: We included adults with persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (>14 days) visiting a primary care physician and in whom stool microscopy revealed only Blastocystis sp. Eligible patients were randomized to receive 10 days of metronidazole or placebo, followed by a crossover if still symptomatic. The primary outcome was normal stool consistency. Secondary outcomes were the changes in other abdominal symptoms (bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain, number of daily bowel movements) and general wellbeing. After the clinical phase of the study, Blastocystis subtypes were determined by PCR sequencing and stool samples were tested for 11 other protozoa with an in‐house PCR. RESULTS: We screened 581 outpatients for inclusion, of which 50 met the eligibility criteria. There was no difference in the primary outcome, nor any of the secondary outcomes between the subjects treated with metronidazole and placebo.The most frequent Blastocystis subtypes were ST4 (11/36) and ST2 (10/36).

POMJ consumption significantly reduced fecal calprotectin (FC) and plasma endotoxin levels. Transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed upregulation of genes involved in mucosal immunity, including aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), neutrophil cytosolic factor 4 (NCF4), and nuclear factor, interleukin 3 regulated (NFIL3). Urolithin metabotypes were predominantly of the B type, associated with intestinal dysbiosis. No significant changes were observed in serum inflammatory markers or colonic mucosal cytokine expression. POMJ consumption reduced markers of intestinal inflammation and modulated gene expression related to mucosal immunity and barrier function in patients with IBD. These findings suggest the potential of POMJ as a beneficial dietary intervention for maintaining remission in IBD, highlighting the promise of targeted nutritional strategies in managing chronic inflammatory conditions. Further research is needed to elucidate the long‐term clinical implications of these molecular changes.

Mastiha's anti‐inflammatory properties are well established. Our aim was to investigate Mastiha's regulatory effect on IL‐17A serum levels in IBD patients. Alterations of the faecal metabolome as a functional readout of microbial activity were explored. A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group design was applied for a total of 3 months in active and 6 months in inactive IBD patients. Serum IL‐17A increased significantly in Mastiha group (p = 0.006), and the mean change differed significantly between Mastiha and placebo (p = 0.003) even after adjusting for age, sex and BMI (p = 0.001) in inactive patients. In inactive UC patients IL‐17A decreased significantly only in placebo (p = 0.033). No significant differences were detected in active disease. Faecal metabolomics indicated that intervention with Mastiha influenced considerably the metabolic profile of IBD patients in remission exhibiting, in between others, increased levels of glycine and tryptophan. Glycine has been proposed to have a therapeutic effect against IBD, while tryptophan derivatives are involved in immunoregalutory mechanisms, such as the Th17 cells differentiation. Thus, it is quite possible that the immunoregulatory role of Mastiha in quiescent IBD involves the regulation of Th17 cells function and differentiation.",138,,111535,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 34311533,,,,,Journal article,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anti‐Inflammatory Agents [adverse effects, isolation & purification, *therapeutic use]; Colitis, Ulcerative [*drug therapy, immunology, metabolism]; Crohn Disease [*drug therapy, immunology, metabolism]; Double‐Blind Method; Feces [*chemistry]; Female; Greece; Humans; Interleukin‐17 [*blood]; Male; Mastic Resin [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Middle Aged; Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Th17 Cells [drug effects, immunology, metabolism]; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111535,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02296080/full,

Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",2025,"Interactions between the gut microbiota and intestinal barrier may contribute to the pathophysiology of high‐altitude illnesses. This study aimed to determine the effects of targeting the gut microbiota using dietary supplementation with a blend of fermentable fibers and polyphenol sources on gut microbiota composition, fecal short‐chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and intestinal function and permeability during hypobaric hypoxia exposure. Healthy adults participated in a randomized, placebo‐controlled, crossover study. Food products containing oligofructose‐enriched inulin, galacto‐oligosaccharide, high‐amylose corn starch, cocoa, green tea and cranberry extracts, and blueberry powder (FP) or maltodextrin (placebo; PL) were consumed daily during three 2‐wk phases separated by a ≥1‐wk washout. During the final 36 h of each phase, participants resided in a hypobaric chamber simulating low (LA; 500 m) or high (HA; 4,300 m) altitude creating three experimental conditions: PL + LA, PL + HA, and FP + HA. Twenty‐six participants completed ≥1 study phase and 13 [12 male; 21 ± 3 yr; body mass index (BMI) 25.4 ± 2.4 kg/m2] completed all three phases. Results demonstrated that FP mitigated hypoxia‐induced increases in intestinal permeability within the small intestine and proximal colon while increasing Bifidobacterium relative abundance and decreasing gut microbiota α‐diversity and colonic pH. Higher Bifidobacterium relative abundance and lower colonic pH were associated with greater reductions in intestinal permeability. However, FP did not alter fecal SCFA concentrations and increased gastrointestinal symptoms and altitude sickness during hypobaric hypoxia exposure. Findings suggest that targeting the gut microbiota with a combination of fermentable fibers and polyphenols can prevent hypobaric hypoxia‐induced increases in intestinal permeability but that benefit does translate into a reduction in altitude illness symptoms.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Dietary supplementation targeting the gut microbiota may provide novel approaches to improving physiologic responses to environmental stressors such as those experienced during sojourn at high terrestrial altitudes.

There is still uncertainty on whether the recommended quarantine duration is sufficient to reduce the risk of transmission. This study aimed to investigate the persistence of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal, blood, urine, and stool samples of patients with COVID‐19. Methods: In this hospital‐based longitudinal study, 100 confirmed cases of COVID‐19 were recruited between March 2020 and August 2020 in Guilan Province, north of Iran. Nasopharyngeal, blood, urine, and stool samples were obtained from each participant at the time of hospital admission, upon discharge, 1 week after discharge, and every 2 weeks until all samples were negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA by reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) assay. A survival analysis was also performed to identify the duration of viral persistence. Results: The median duration of viral RNA persistence in the nasopharyngeal samples was 8 days from the first positive RT‐PCR result upon admission (95% CI 6.91–9.09); the maximum duration of viral shedding was 25 days from admission. Positive blood, urine, and stool RT‐PCR results were detected in 24%, 7%, and 6% of the patients, respectively. The median duration of viral persistence in the blood, urine, and stool samples was 7 days (95% CI 6.07–7.93), 6 days (95% CI 4.16–8.41), and 13 days (95% CI 6.96–19.4), respectively. Also, the maximum duration of viral persistence in the blood, urine, and stool samples was 17, 11, and 42 days from admission, respectively. Conclusion: According to the present results, immediately after the hospitalized patients were discharged, no evidence of viral genetic materials was found.

Understanding limited impacts from a randomized control trial of water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions in a high burden setting",medRxiv: the preprint server for health sciences,2024,"Background: Despite their strong theoretical basis, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions have had inconsistent benefits on diarrhea in low‐ and middle‐income settings. The WASH Benefits (WASH‐B) Kenya randomized controlled trial evaluated a set of WASH interventions targeted at children under age 2 and found no effect on diarrheal prevalence. Objectives: We explored whether and how changes to intervention and contextual factors could impact health gains as a means to inform future WASH interventions. Methods: We implemented a compartmental transmission model with environmental pathways and water (W), sanitation (S), and hygiene (H) interventions fit to WASH‐B Kenya trial data (n=11,856) using a Bayesian sampling approach. We developed counterfactual simulations to predict how a trial might perform given improved 1) local contextual factors (i.e., reduced transmission, and increased completeness of transmission pathways targeted) and/or 2) intervention factors (i.e., increased intervention efficacy, compliance, and community coverage). We considered change in intervention effectiveness in the counterfactual scenarios for each intervention alone and in combination (WSH). We determined what combinations would be needed to achieve 50% reduction in child diarrhea compared to the control arm. Results: We found that high diarrheal prevalence in the WASH‐B Kenya trial was likely the primary reason for ineffectiveness. While none of the tested counterfactual factors greatly impacted intervention effectiveness in isolation, we estimated that 50% reduction in child diarrhea in the combined WSH treatment arm could be achieved through a combination of substantial intervention improvements (i.e., 50% intervention efficacy, 100% compliance, and 60% community coverage), but could not be attained for the single intervention arms. With improvements to contextual factors (consistent, 7.5% diarrheal prevalence, 50% increase in completeness) coupled with more modest increases in intervention factors (i.e., 50% efficacy and 100% compliance but only 20% community coverage), could achieve a 50% reduction in diarrhea in the combined WSH arm. Conclusions: In settings with high enteric pathogen prevalence, WASH interventions must be used by a substantial fraction the population and block all main transmission routes to achieve substantial reductions in diarrheal disease burden, including those over age 2. The WASH interventions and targeting strategy for the WASH‐B Kenya trial were unlikely to appreciably reduce diarrheal disease because of the high burden. In settings with more modest transmission, there are intervention factor targets that could result in measurable reductions in diarrhea.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prospective single‐center study in R.M. Gorbacheva institute included 27 patients with GI GVHD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. 19 patients received FMT, 8 patients received placebo. Clinical scales for GI autoimmune diseases were used to evaluate response. Microbiome alterations were assessed with multiplex PCR. RESULTS: After FMT higher overall bacterial mass (р=0.00088), higher bacterial numbers ofBifidobacteriumspp. (р=0.021),Escherichia coli(р=0.049) andBacteroides fragilisgr.

This heterogeneity of outcomes across studies hampers useful synthesis of primary studies and ultimately negatively impacts on decision making by all stakeholders. Core outcome sets offer a potential solution to this problem of heterogeneity and concerns over whether the 'right' outcomes are being measured. One of the first steps in core outcome set generation is to identify the range of outcomes reported (in the literature or by patients directly) that are considered important. OBJECTIVES: To develop a systematic map that examines the variation in outcome reporting of interventions for uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease, and to identify other outcomes of importance to patients with gallstones not previously measured or reported in interventional studies. RESULTS: The literature search identified 794 potentially relevant titles and abstracts of which 137 were deemed eligible for inclusion. A total of 129 randomised controlled trials, 4 gallstone disease specific patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs) and 8 qualitative studies were included. This was supplemented with data from 6 individual interviews, 1 focus group (n=5 participants) and analysis of 20 consultations. A total of 386 individual recorded outcomes were identified across the combined evidence: 330 outcomes (which were reported 1147 times) from trials evaluating interventions, 22 outcomes from PROMs, 17 outcomes from existing qualitative studies and 17 outcomes from primary qualitative research. Areas of overlap between the evidence sources existed but also the primary research contributed new, unreported in this context, outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study took a rigorous approach to catalogue and map the outcomes of importance in gallstone disease to enhance the development of the COS 'long' list.

A parallel cohort of age‐matched normal‐BMI pregnant women who will notreceive any nutritional intervention will serve as a reference control group.AIM 2 ‐ Preclinical Component This Aim has two parts ‐ a therapeutic targetidentification component (AIM 2A) and a glycan therapeutic development component (AIM2B).Test of MD‐BEP and new maternal microbiome directed glycans to ameliorateenteropathy/Biomarker of EED.Background of the Project including Preliminary Observations:Undernutrition among women of reproductive age is more common in South Asia than in anyother region. In South Asia, the prevalence of maternal undernutrition varies between 10and 40%. Particularly in Bangladesh, the prevalence of undernutrition among women is muchhigher than in any other developing country, with more than 30% of women of reproductiveage reported to be malnourished. Maternal undernutrition has persistently been describedto be a major contributor to child morbidity, mortality, and poor birth outcomes,including low birth weight (LBW), neonatal mortality, and subsequent childhoodundernutrition. Maternal undernutrition alone accounts for about 25‐50% of intrauterinegrowth restriction. In such a way, under‐nutrition can be transferred from one generationto other. Half of the under‐five children in slums of Bangladesh are stunted havingretarded linear growth compared to one‐third in non‐slum areas.The prevention or treatment of intergenerational malnutrition represents a criticalmedical need that is yet to be addressed and remains a pressing global health challenge.There is a scarcity of data on the contribution of small intestinal (SI) microbiota topathogenesis of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) of malnutrition, as it isdifficult to obtain gut biopsy specimens from malnourished individuals, especiallychildren. The Bangladesh Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (BEED) study, involvingparticipants who live in an urban slum (Mirpur) in Dhaka, provided an opportunity toexamine the role of the duodenal microbiota in the pathogenesis of EED in children andalso performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on thirty‐eight 18‐45‐year‐oldmalnourished (BMI<18.5 kg/m2) women residing in the same resource‐poor setting of Mirpur,Dhaka who failed to respond to a egg/milk/micronutrients‐ based nutritional interventioncomparable to that given to children. It was observed that malnourished women ofchildbearing age living in Mirpur exhibit small intestinal enteropathy resembling thatfound in Mirpur children with EED. In this proposal, our primary aim is to test thehypothesis that the SI microbiota contributes to SI enteropathy and malnutrition(low‐BMI) in young Bangladeshi women of childbearing age. Furthermore, there is someinitial evidence that pregnancy outcomes can be predicted by the features of the gutmicrobiota of pregnant women. The maternal gut microbiota itself may influence thedevelopment of the offspring cohort, both in prenatal and postnatal life. As maternal gutmicrobiota, directly and indirectly, influences the metabolism of the fetus and infants,it may be possible to optimize gestational weight gain (GWG), pregnancy outcomes, andsubsequent growth and development of children through modulation of intestinal microbiotain women during pregnancy and lactation. Therefore, a corollary of our primary aim isthat direct or indirect transmission of the gut microbiota of mothers with EED to theirchildren perpetuates intergenerational undernutrition.Conventional nutritional interventions or low‐cost water and sanitation interventions maybe ineffective in reversing EED‐related growth faltering in children, warrantingmicrobiota/microbiome targeted food and other interventions. Prototypes for nutritionalinterventions that are composed of locally available, affordable, culturally acceptablecomplementary foods commonly consumed in Bangladesh have recently been developed.Microbiota‐ directed complementary food (MDCF) formulations were subsequently tested in apre‐proof‐of‐concept (POC) study involving 12‐18‐month‐old Bangladeshi children withmoderate acute malnutrition (MAM) living in the same slum (Mirpur). One of the MDCFs,MDCF‐2, was distinguished from the other formulations based on its superior performancebased on certain parameters including growth.The latest WHO antenatal care guideline advises implementing balanced energy and protein(BEP) supplementation for pregnant women residing in undernourished communities. The Billand Melinda Gates Foundation organized an expert consultation in September 2016 todevelop nutrient content targets for affordable nutritional supplements for pregnant andlactating women in undernourished settings. The expert consultation recommended thatwomen in undernourished settings receive a daily BEP supplement containing 250‐500 kcalof energy and 14‐18 grams of protein. With this in mind, we propose to include aninterventional component involving the administration of microbiota‐directed balancedenergy protein (MD‐BEP) in pregnant and non‐pregnant low‐BMI women. This modified BEPwill contain ingredients from the previously mentioned MDCF‐2 that are aimed at improvingmicrobiota. With this in mind, the investigators propose to include an interventionalcomponent involving the administration of MD‐BEP in pregnant and non‐pregnant low‐BMIwomen. In this intervention component, beginning at the end of the first trimester,low‐BMI (<18.5 kg/m2) pregnant women (aged 18‐35 years) will be randomly assigned toreceive either the MD‐BEP or Ready‐use‐supplementary food‐balanced energy protein(RUSF‐BEP) for the duration of their pregnancy and during the first three postnatalmonths, in addition to standard antenatal care. A parallel cohort of age‐matchednormal‐BMI pregnant women who will not receive any nutritional intervention will serve asa reference control group. In this intervention component, beginning at the end of thefirst trimester, low‐BMI (<18.5 kg/m2) pregnant women (aged 18‐35 years) will be randomlyassigned to receive either the MD‐BEP or RUSF‐BEP for the duration of their pregnancy andduring the first 3 postnatal months, in addition to standard antenatal care. A parallelcohort of age‐matched normal‐BMI pregnant women who will not receive any nutritionalintervention will serve as a reference control group.The investigators will test the hypothesis that small intestinal microbiota contributesto small intestinal enteropathy and malnutrition in young Bangladeshi women ofchildbearing age. An interventional component will be included involving theadministration of MD‐BEP in pregnant and non‐pregnant low‐BMI women. This will be basedon the hypothesis that transmission of the microbiota of mothers with EED to theirchildren perpetuates intergenerational undernutrition.The overarching goals for the current study will be to: 1. Delineate mechanisms by which the SI microbial community obtained from low‐BMIMirpur women contributes to maternal malnutrition and identify surrogate biomarkersthat can be applied to malnourished pregnant women 2. Test whether MD‐BEP can ameliorate EED as judged by these surrogate endpoints inlow‐BMI women (who are either pregnant or non‐pregnant) 3. Develop a gnotobiotic mouse model of maternal EED using culture collections frommalnourished low‐BMI as well as normal BMI women, and identify microbial therapeutictargets in their SI microbiota, and 4. Perform preclinical tests of MD‐BEP and candidate therapeutic glycans in gnotobioticmice to identify/develop candidate glycan/synbiotic therapeutics for future clinicalstudies. These preclinical models will also serve as a platform for testingcandidate therapeutics arising from other BMGF‐sponsored initiatives where there isgood confidence in rationale.To achieve the goals, in this proposed study the investigators will use two specific aimsinvolving the human subjects, AIM 1A and AIM 1B. In AIM 1A the investigators will comparethe SI and fecal microbiota and the plasma, duodenal and fecal proteomes/ metabolomes ofnon‐pregnant, young malnourished Bangladeshi women (BMI<18.5kg/m2) who havehistopathologic evidence of SI enteropathy versus those with normal BMIs (20‐24.9kg/m2)and no histopathologic evidence of enteropathy who have undergone routine endoscopicevaluation for dyspepsia. In AIM 1B, the investigators will perform an interventionstudy, beginning at the end of the first trimester, in which low‐BMI (<18.5 kg/m2)pregnant women (aged 18‐35 years) will be randomly assigned to receive either MD‐BEP orRUSF‐BEP for the duration of their pregnancy and during the first 3 postnatal months, inaddition to standard antenatal care (n=30/ arm). A parallel cohort of age‐matchednormal‐BMI pregnant women who will not receive any nutritional intervention will serve asa reference control group.Methods:In AIM 1A, for the healthy group, the investigators plan to recruit a cohort ofnormal‐BMI Bangladeshi women who will undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) forevaluation of functional dyspepsia and our goal is to identify 30 normal BMI participantswho have normal duodenal mucosal histology and collect duodenal biopsies, duodenalaspirates, plus plasma and fecal specimens from these participants at the time ofendoscopy. In order to enroll these 30 participants with normal duodenal mucosalhistology, the investigators are planning to perform EGD on 100 healthy women (BMI20‐24.9 kg/m2) of childbearing age who have been referred for evaluation of functionaldyspepsia. Participants will be screened from women attending Gastroenterology OPD ofSheikh Russel National Gastroliver Institute and Hospital, the Bangladesh SpecializedHospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh, and the community, who meet the inclusion criteria.Undernourished low‐BMI (<18.5kg/m2; 18‐35 years) women of childbearing age will beenrolled from Bauniabadh and adjacent slum area of Mirpur, Dhaka and EGD will beperformed among 60 women at icddr,b Dhaka Hospital, Sheikh Russel National GastroliverInstitute and Hospital, Bangladesh Specialized Hospital, or icddr,b hospital, Dhaka.Participants will be screened through household surveys from the Bauniabadh and adjacentslum area of from Mirpur, Dhaka. The endoscopist is the same individual who performed EGDon the children as well as malnourished women in the BEED study. After EGD, the low‐BMIwomen will be randomized into two groups and receive daily dietary supplementation witheither MD‐BEP or RUSF‐BEP for a period of 90 days, with a further 270 days of follow‐upafter cessation of the intervention and biological samples will be collected from theparticipants according to the schedule. Healthy women with normal BMI who underwent EGDwill also be followed similarly for 360 days, without any nutritional intervention.A nested sub‐study will be done under aim 1A to test the Small Intestine MicroBiomeAspiration (SIMBA) capsule, a small, ingestible pill that can selectively sample thesmall intestine microbiome. The SIMBA study will apply for approval through a separateprotocol. For AIM 1B, beginning at the end of the first trimester, in which low‐BMI(<18.5 kg/m2) pregnant women (aged 18‐35 years) will be randomly assigned to receiveeither MD‐BEP or RUSF‐BEP for the duration of their pregnancy and during the first 3postnatal months, in addition to standard antenatal care (n=30/arm). A parallel cohort ofage‐matched normal‐BMI pregnant women who will not receive any nutritional interventionwill serve as a reference control group. The investigators are planning to test aminimal‐risk device to collect tissue samples from the small intestine (e.g. trans‐ nasalintroduction tube or TNIT) in a sub‐sample of pregnant women under our Aim 1b of ourproposed proposal. Therefore, a nested sub‐study will be done under aim 1B to testtethered capsule endoscopy (TNIT) to study small‐ intestinal morphology for EED in agroup of 15 pregnant women enrolled in the study based on the assumption that by the timethis technology would be validated with conventional endoscopy in women of reproductiveage under the Experimental Medicine Platform (Protocol # PR‐22082) as well as safety datawill be available on pregnant women from the study conducted elsewhere. The participantsof this sub‐study will be selected randomly from those who will provide their consent toparticipate in the sub‐study. In addition, a preclinical component will be performedaimed at a therapeutic target identification component (AIM 2A) and a glycan therapeuticdevelopment objective (AIM 2B) at Washington University in St. Louis.The investigators plan to recruit a cohort of normal‐BMI Bangladeshi women who willundergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for evaluation of functional dyspepsia and ourgoal is to identify 30 normal BMI participants who have normal duodenal mucosal histologyand collect duodenal biopsies, duodenal aspirates, plus plasma and fecal specimens fromthese participants at the time of endoscopy. Moreover, plasma and fecal samples will becollected according to the follow‐up schedule.Sites:Participants will be screened from those attending gastroenterology out‐patientdepartment (OPD) of Sheikh Russel National Gastroliver Institute and Hospital BangladeshSpecialized Hospital, and from the community who meet the inclusion criteria.Field Site:Participants will be screened through household surveys from the Bauniabadh and adjacentslum area of from Mirpur, Dhaka (Fig.4). This area is densely populated and is located7‐8 km from the icddr,b Dhaka Hospital at Mohakhali. Mirpur is selected as the study sitebecause it is inhabited by poor and middle‐ class families, residential and sanitaryconditions are typical of any congested urban settlement, and the study investigatorshave ongoing research activities in the area. The site has a typical squatter settlement;the average family size of households is 4.5, with 48% females. About 20% of householdshave a monthly income of only US$62, 30% of mothers never attended school, and only 3%obtained secondary school education. The majority of the people are day laborers, garmentworkers, and transport workers. Mirpur has a population of about half a million in anarea of 14.22 km2. More than 38, 000 people live in each square kilometer of the areacompared with the mean of 8229/km2 in Dhaka district and 976/km2 in Bangladesh17.Screening, recruitment and consenting Census, screening, enrolment of subjects (low‐BMIwomen) will be done in Bauniabadh area of Mirpur in Dhaka city. Women who meet theinclusion‐exclusion criteria will be approached about enrolment into this study. Atrained Field Research Assistant (FRA) will explain the study in detail, answer anyquestions from the participant or her relatives, and invite her for enrolment in thestudy. If she is interested to volunteer in the study, the designated staff will proceedto screening and consenting.Screening will consist of a review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed above.A detailed history will be obtained from the participants following clinical examination.Adult participants who fulfill the inclusion criteria and are not excluded throughhistory and clinical examination will undergo following screening tests based on clinicaljudgement: Chest x‐ray, urine for R/E, ultrasonography of whole abdomen, fasting bloodglucose/ HbA1c, stool for occult blood test (OBT), cancer markers (ie. CEA, CA 15.3, CA19.9). Patients diagnosed with any abnormal lab test results will be treated by the studyphysician as per standard guidelines. Patients requiring expert opinion regarding anycomplicated clinical condition will be referred to a subject specialist accordingly.If the subject is eligible to participate, the process will proceed to consenting,consisting of a thorough review of the written consent form in a manner appropriate fortheir literacy level. Prior to signing the consent form, she will have an opportunity toask any questions about the study. If the FRA determines that participants havedemonstrated adequate comprehension of the study, the consent form will be signed by theFRA and the participant.

ENT‐01 inhibits the formation of aS aggregates and improved constipation in an open‐label study in patients with PD. Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral ENT‐01 for constipation and neurologic symptoms in patients with PD and constipation. Design: Randomized, placebo‐controlled phase 2b study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03781791) Setting: Outpatient. Patients: 150 patients with PD and constipation. Intervention: ENT‐01 or placebo daily for up to 25 days. After baseline assessment of constipation severity, daily dosing was escalated to the prokinetic dose, the maximum dose (250 mg), or the tolerability limit, followed by a washout period. Measurements: The primary efficacy end point was the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week. Neurologic end points included dementia (assessed using the Mini‐Mental State Examination [MMSE]) and psychosis (assessed using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms adapted for PD [SAPS‐PD]). Results: The weekly CSBM rate increased from 0.7 to 3.2 in the ENT‐01 group versus 0.7 to 1.2 in the placebo group (P < 0.001).

Vaccination is the most cost‐effective method of preventing and controlling HBV infection. In Argentina, vaccination against HBV is mandatory for HCW since 1992 (Law 24.151), it is incorporated into the immunization schedule for newborns from the year 2000 to contribute to the elimination and control of HBV, and in 2013 it was universalized. The aim of this study was to determine the immunity of HCW against HBV. A descriptive and prospective study was carried out with HCW, who stated they were vaccinated (1997‐2019), at MPTB from August to September 2019. Exclusion criteria: HCW with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) reactive. Blood samples were used to measure antibodies against the HB surface antigen (anti‐HBs) and HBsAg by ELISA using commercial kits the Biokit and Wiener lab respectively. Anti‐HBs levels of ≥10 mIU/mL were considered reactive and protective. The statistical analyses were performed with the software GraphPad Prism 5.0. Of 151 randomLy selected HCW 82% (124) were females and 18% (27) males, the average age was 40 (range 25‐67). The distribution according to professional category was: 30% (45) nurses, 16% (24) technicians, 13% (19) physicians, 12% (18) administrative staff, 8% (12) biochemists, 7% (11) obstetricians, 3% (5) personal responsible for cleaning, 3% (5) pharmacists, 2% (3) ambulance driver, 2% (3) social worker, 1% (2) physiotherapists, 1% (2) sanitary workers, 1% (2) phonoaudiologists. All HCW were non‐reactive for HBsAg. The overall prevalence of anti‐HBs in the HCW was 62%. The group the HCW aged 25‐34 had a significantly higher prevalence (67%) compared with the groups HWC aged 35‐45 (62%, P<0.02), aged 46‐55 (44%, P<0.001) and aged 55‐67 (58% P<0.01), respectively. There was 7% (11) were unaware of their vaccination status and who were vaccinated in the last 6 years, presented higher protection (66%). In the most exposed professions, biochemists, nurses, physicians, and technicians, the prevalence of protection was 42% (5), 64% (29), 79% (15), and 71% (17), respectively. The most important result of this study was that nearly two‐thirds (62%) of the HCW had a protective anti‐HBs level, coinciding with published data. In any case, an anti‐HBs level <10 mIU/mL is equivalent to not being vaccinated, as some vaccinated subjects will not respond to vaccination and, in responders, anti‐HBs titers decrease over time, becoming negative in many cases. Although HBV infections have declined substantially since the introduction of HBV vaccination, the risk of exposure to HBV persists in the healthcare setting. Therefore, there is a need to improve vaccination programs in HCW, in order to protect them from infected persons and vice versa.",44,SUPPL 1,58‐59,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 633610604,,,,Journal article; Conference proceeding,*Hepatitis B virus; *immunity; *obstetrician; Administrative personnel; Adult; Ambulance; Biochemist; Cleaning; Conference abstract; Controlled study; Data analysis software; Doctor nurse relation; Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Female; Health care personnel; Human; Male; Middle aged; Nonhuman; Pharmacist; Physiotherapist; Prevalence; Prospective study; Randomized controlled trial; Social worker; Vaccination,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02214800/full,

The research quantifies total viable bacteria and MRSA counts and evaluates the percentage difference between treated and control bedding material over a one‐week period. DESIGN: A double‐blind interventional, double cross‐over study. SETTING: Haven of Hope Woo Ping Care and Attention Home in Sai Kung, Hong Kong. METHODS: Over an 8‐week period, bedding materials from residents' rooms were sampled, totalling 288 samples from 96 bedsheets, with half treated with MAP‐1 and the remaining serving as controls. MAP‐1, developed at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, incorporates USFDA and USEPA‐approved polymers. Sampling procedures adhered to standardized protocols, and bacterial counts were determined using culture methods. Data analysis employed t‐tests and ANOVA to compare microbial loads between the control and treatment groups, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The study revealed a significant reduction in total viable bacteria and MRSA counts on bedsheets treated with MAP‐1. Noteworthy reductions of 80.37% for total bacteria and 87.31% for MRSA at the end of seven‐day use, in the intervention group compared to the control. These reductions were statistically significant across all four observation periods and among both male and female residents.

We studied the effect of Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 (Lc40) on growth and infection incidence of the infants, when the probiotic is administrated to the mothers. Moreover, whether such effects might depend on the interaction between the mother or infant microbiota and the probiotic administration. A total of 291 mother‐infant pairs were studied for 16 weeks in a randomised double‐blinded placebo‐controlled multicentre trial. The Lc40 group (n=139) received 1 capsule/day containing 3×109 cfu Lc40; the control group (n=152) received 1 placebo (maltodextrin) capsule/day. A positive and significant correlation of the Staphylococcus load between breast milk and infant faeces was only observed in control group. Additionally, the weight z‐score of the infants whose mothers had higher values of Lactobacillus in their breast milk were significantly higher for the Lc40 group. We observed a significant lower incidence of conjunctivitis in the infants whose mothers received Lc40. A higher load of Staphylococcus in infant faeces significantly increased the risk of respiratory infections. Such incidence, under an absent or low Staphylococcus load in the faeces, was significantly 36 times higher in the infants in the control group than in the infants in the Lc40 group. However, the protective effect of Lc40 was gradually reduced as the Staphylococcus load of the milk increased. The administration of Lc40 to nursing women might influence infant growth and health but it seems to depend on its interactions with mother or infant microbiota.

Objective: To evaluate the effects of an invitation to screen for H pylori on gastric cancer incidence and mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: A pragmatic randomized clinical trial of residents aged 50 to 69 years in Changhua County, Taiwan, eligible for biennial fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) for colon cancer screening. Participants were randomized to either an invitation for H pylori stool antigen (HPSA) + FIT assessment or FIT alone. The study was conducted between January 1, 2014, and September 27, 2018. Final follow‐up occurred December 31, 2020. Intervention: Invitation for testing for H pylori stool antigen. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were gastric cancer incidence and gastric cancer mortality. All invited individuals were analyzed according to the groups to which they were randomized. Results: Of 240 000 randomized adults (mean age, 58.1 years [SD, 5.6]; 46.8% female), 63 508 were invited for HPSA + FIT, and 88 995 were invited for FIT alone. Of the 240 000 randomized, 38 792 who were unreachable and 48 705 who did not receive an invitation were excluded. Of those invited, screening participation rates were 49.6% (31 497/63 508) for HPSA + FIT and 35.7% (31 777/88 995) for FIT alone. Among 12 142 participants (38.5%) with positive HPSA results, 8664 (71.4%) received antibiotic treatment, and eradication occurred in 91.9%. Gastric cancer incidence rates were 0.032% in the HPSA + FIT group and 0.037% in the FIT‐alone group (mean difference, ‐0.005% [95% CI, ‐0.013% to 0.003%]; P = .23). Gastric cancer mortality rates were 0.015% in the HPSA + FIT group and 0.013% in the FIT‐alone group (mean difference, 0.002% [95% CI, ‐0.004% to 0.007%]; P = .57). After adjusting for differences in screening participation, length of follow‐up, and patient characteristics in post hoc analyses, an invitation for HPSA + FIT was associated with lower rates of gastric cancer (0.79 [95% CI, 0.63‐0.98]) but not with gastric cancer mortality (1.02 [95% CI, 0.73‐1.40]), compared with FIT alone. Among participants who received antibiotics, the most common adverse effects were abdominal pain or diarrhea (2.1%) and dyspepsia or poor appetite (0.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among residents of Taiwan, an invitation to test for HPSA combined with FIT did not reduce rates of gastric cancer or gastric cancer mortality, compared with an invitation for FIT alone. However, when differences in screening participation and length of follow‐up were accounted for, gastric cancer incidence, but not gastric cancer mortality, was lower in the HSPA + FIT group, compared with FIT alone.

The risks and benefits of antibiotic treatment in individuals with such cases are unknown. Fecal samples of NAAT‐positive, toxin enzyme immunoas‐say (EIA)‐negative patients were collected before, during, and after randomization to vancomycin (n = 8) or placebo (n = 7). C. difficile and antibiotic‐resistant organisms (AROs) were selectively cultured from fecal and environmental samples. Shotgun metagenomics and comparative isolate genomics were used to understand the impact of oral vancomycin on the microbiome and environmental contamination. Overall, 80% of placebo patients and 71% of vancomycin patients were colonized with C. difficile posttreatment. One person randomized to placebo subsequently received treatment for CDI. In the vancomycin‐treated group, beta‐diversity (P = 0.0059) and macrolide‐lincosamide‐streptogramin (MLS) resistance genes (P = 0.037) increased after treatment; C. difficile and vancomycin‐resistant enterococci (VRE) environmental contamination was found in 53% of patients and 26% of patients, respectively. We found that vancomycin alters the gut microbiota, does not permanently clear C. difficile, and is associated with VRE colonization/environmental contamination. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT03388268.) IMPORTANCE A gold standard diagnostic for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) does not exist. An area of controversy is how to manage patients whose stool tests positive by nucleic acid amplification tests but negative by toxin enzyme immunoassay. Existing data suggest most of these patients do not have CDI, but most are treated with oral vancomycin. Potential benefits to treatment include a decreased risk for adverse outcomes if the patient does have CDI and the potential to decrease C. difficile shedding/transmission. However, oral vancomycin perturbs the intestinal micro‐biota and promotes antibiotic‐resistant organism colonization/transmission. We conducted a double‐blinded randomized controlled trial to assess the risk‐benefit of oral vancomycin treatment in this population. Oral vancomycin did not result in long‐term clearance of C. difficile, perturbed the microbiota, and was associated with colonization/shedding of vancomycin‐resistant enterococci. This work underscores the need to better understand this population of patients in the context of C. difficile/ARO‐related outcomes and transmission.",6,1,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 33441409,EMBASE 2010838277,,,,Journal article,"*Clostridioides; *vancomycin resistant Enterococcus; Administration, Oral; Adult; Adverse outcome; Aged; Antibiotic resistance; Anti‐Bacterial Agents [*administration & dosage, adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Article; Clinical article; Clinical trial; Clostridioides difficile [*drug effects, physiology]; Clostridium Infections [*drug therapy]; Contamination; Controlled study; Diagnostic test accuracy study; Double blind procedure; Drug therapy; Enzyme immunoassay; Feces [*microbiology]; Feces analysis; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome [*drug effects, genetics]; Gold standard; Human; Human cell; Humans; Intestine flora; Male; Metagenomics; Metagenomics [methods]; Middle Aged; Nonhuman; Nucleic acid amplification; Outcome assessment; Randomized controlled trial; Risk assessment; Vancomycin [*administration & dosage, adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Vancomycin‐Resistant Enterococci [drug effects, genetics, isolation & purification]",10.1128/mSphere.00936-20,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02246025/full,

Individuals infected with H pylori, aged 18‐70 years, and without previous eradication therapy were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio (block size of six) to receive vonoprazan (20 mg twice a day) with either low‐dose amoxicillin (1 g twice a day; LVA therapy) or high‐dose amoxicillin (1 g three times a day; HVA therapy) for 14 days. Gastric biopsies were collected before treatment for detection of antibiotic resistance. Stool samples were collected at baseline, week 2, and week 8‐10 for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The primary outcome was the eradication rate of H pylori, assessed by 13C urea breath test, in both intention‐to‐treat and per‐protocol analyses. Secondary outcomes were adverse events, adherence, antibiotic resistance, and alterations to the gut microbiota and antibiotic resistome. The margin used to establish non‐inferiority was ‐0·10. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05649709. FINDINGS: Between Feb 13, 2023, and Jan 25, 2024, 504 patients (204 [40%] male and 300 [60%] female; mean age 43 years [SD 13]) were randomly assigned to LVA therapy or HVA therapy (n=252 in each group). No infections were resistant to amoxicillin. The H pylori eradication rate was 85·3% (215 of 252; 95% CI 80·4 to 89·2) in the LVA group and 86·5% (218 of 252; 81·7 to 90·2) in the HVA group in the intention‐to‐treat analysis (p=0·70) and 88·8% (213 of 240; 84·1 to 92·2) and 92·4% (218 of 236; 88·3 to 95·1), respectively, in the per‐protocol analysis (p=0·18). The efficacy of LVA was non‐inferior to HVA in the intention‐to‐treat analysis (risk difference ‐1·2%, 95% CI ‐7·3 to 4·9, p=0·0022) and the per‐protocol analysis (‐3·6%, ‐9·0 to 1·7, p=0·0085). 31 (12%) patients in the LVA group and 43 (17%) patients in the HVA group reported adverse events. Adherence to therapy was 97% in the LVA group and 96% in the HVA group. The diversity of gut microbiota decreased after treatment but was restored to baseline at week 8‐10 in both groups. The abundance of beta‐lactam‐related resistance genes was increased at week 2 after treatment, and was restored to pretreatment level at week 8‐10 for the LVA group but not the HVA group. INTERPRETATION: LVA dual therapy was effective and non‐inferior to HVA dual therapy as first‐line treatment of H pylori infection and showed a non‐lasting effect on the abundance of beta‐lactam‐related resistance genes. High amoxicillin dosage (eg, 3 g per day) is not required to achieve high cure rates with vonoprazan dual therapy.

We hypothesized that introduction of prokinetic drug in addition to enemas would improve intestinal motility. Primary outcome: time needed to achieve full enteral feeds and normal stooling pattern. Secondary outcome: day when start of minimal enteral feeding was feasible, necrotizing enterocolitis incidence, length of hospitalization and whether daily meconium evacuation is more effective than evacuation in presence of clinical symptoms only. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted from December 1st, 2015 until December 1st, 2016 in level III neonatal unit on 67 preterm infants ≤32 gestational weeks and intestinal hypomotility. Infants were allocated to: group 1, treated with saline enemas twice daily until normal stooling pattern was achieved; and group 2, treated with erythromycin and enemas. Infants with intestinal hypomotility, hospitalized from December 1st, 2014 to December 1st, 2015, were assigned to group 3, and were treated with enemas only when symptoms of abdominal distension or absence of stool for 48 hours were observed. RESULTS: Total of 127 neonates was included in this study; 33 were assigned to group 1, 34 to group 2, and 60 to group 3.

In the era of COVID‐19, millions of people can be reached by E‐E media without requiring any physical contact. We have designed a short, wordless, animated video about COVID‐19 hygiene practices‐such as social distancing and frequent hand washing‐that can be rapidly distributed through social media channels to a global audience. The E‐E video's effectiveness, however, remains unclear. The study aims to achieve the following objectives. To: 1.Quantify people's interest in watching a short, animated video about COVID‐19 hygiene (abbreviated to CoVideo).2.Establish the CoVideo's effectiveness in increasing behavioural intent toward COVID‐19 hygiene.3.Establish the CoVideo's effectiveness in improving COVID‐19 hygiene knowledge. TRIAL DESIGN: The present study is a multi‐site, parallel group, randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effectiveness of the CoVideo against an attention placebo control (APC) video or no video. The trial has an intervention arm (CoVideo), placebo arm (APC), and control arm (no video). Nested in each trial arm is a list experiment and questionnaire survey, with the following ordering. Arm 1: the CoVideo, list experiment, and questionnaire survey. Arm 2: the APC video, list experiment, questionnaire survey, and CoVideo. Arm 3: the list experiment, questionnaire survey, and CoVideo. For each list experiment, participants will be randomized to a control or treatment group. The control group will receive a list of five items and the treatment group will receive the same five items plus one item about COVID‐19 hygiene. We will use the list experiment to reduce response bias associated with socially desirable answers to COVID‐19 questions. The questionnaire survey will include items about the participant's age, sex, country of residence, highest education, and knowledge of COVID‐19 spread. After completing the list experiment and questionnaire survey, participants in Arms 2 and 3 will receive the CoVideo to ensure post‐trial access to treatment. PARTICIPANTS: This will be an online study setting. We will use Prolific Academic (ProA: https://www.prolific.co) to recruit participants and host our study on the Gorilla™ platform (www.gorilla.sc). To be eligible, participants must be between the age of 18 and 59 years (male, female, or other) and have current residence in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Mexico, or France. Participants will be excluded from the study if they cannot speak English, German, French, or Spanish (since the instructions and survey questions will be available in these 4 languages only). MAIN OUTCOMES: This study will measure primary and secondary outcomes related to COVID‐19 hygiene. By hygiene, we mean the adoption of behaviors or practices that reduce the chances of being infected or spreading COVID‐19. As our primary outcome, we will measure changes in behavioral intent toward five hygiene practices: social distancing, washing hands, cleaning household surfaces, not sharing eating utensils, and not stockpiling essential goods. As a secondary outcome, we will measure knowledge about behaviors that can prevent the spread of COVID‐19. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED: The Gorilla algorithm will randomize 6,700 participants to each trial arm, giving a total sample size of 20,100. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The intervention is an E‐E video about COVID‐19 hygiene (CoVideo). Developed by our co‐author (MA) for Stanford Medicine, the CoVideo is animated with sound effects, and has no words, speech, or text. The CoVideo shows how the novel coronavirus is spread (airborne, physical contact) and summarizes the public's response to the COVID‐19 outbreak. Key components of the CoVideo are the promotion of five hygiene practices: i) social distancing and avoiding group gatherings, ii) frequently washing hands with soap and water or sanitizer, iii) cleaning surfaces at home (e.g., kitchen counters), iv) not sharing eating utensils, and v) avoidance of stockpiling essential goods (such as toilet paper and face masks). The CoVideo, which was designed for universal reach and optimized for release on social media channels, can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAj38E7vrS8. The comparators are an APC video (Arm 2) or no video (Arm 3). The APC video is similar in style to the CoVideo; it is also animated with a duration of 2.30 minutes, has sound effects but no words, speech, or text. The video message is about how small choices become actions, which become habits, which become a way of life. It is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HEnohs6yYw. Each list experiment will have a control list as the comparator. The control list is needed to measure the prevalence of behavioral intent toward COVID‐19 hygiene. RANDOMIZATION: Using a web‐based randomization algorithm, Gorilla will randomly allocate participants to the intervention (CoVideo), placebo (APC), or control (no video) arm (sequence generation) at a 1:1:1 ratio. Within each trial arm, Gorilla will randomly allocate participants at a 1:1 ratio to the control or treatment group. Items in the lists will be randomly ordered to avoid order effects. The presentation order of the list experiments will also be randomized. BLINDING: Because ProA handles the interaction between the study investigators and participants, the participants will be completely anonymous to the study investigators. The outcome measures will be self‐reported and submitted anonymously. All persons in the study team will be blinded to the group allocation. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol version number is 1.0 and the date is 18 May 2020. Recruitment is expected to end by 22 June 2020. Thus far, the study investigators have recruited 2,500 participants on ProA. Of these participants, 800 have completed the study on the Gorilla platform.

METHODS: We conducted a causal mediation analysis using data from the WASH Benefits Bangladesh cluster‐randomized trial (NCT01590095). Among a subsample of children within the WSH, nutrition, nutrition+WSH, and controls arms (N=1,409), we recorded caregiver‐reported antibiotic use at ages 14 and 28 months and collected stool at age 14 months. Mediators included caregiver‐reported child diarrhea, acute respiratory infection (ARI), and fever; and enteric pathogen carriage in stool measured by qPCR. Models controlled for mediator‐outcome confounders. FINDINGS: The receipt of any WSH or nutrition intervention reduced antibiotic use in the past month by 5.5 percentage points (95% CI 1.2, 9.9) through all pathways, from 49.5% (95% CI 45.9%, 53.0%) in the control group to 45.0 % (95% CI 42.7%, 47.2%) in the pooled intervention group. Interventions reduced antibiotic use by 0.6 percentage points (95% CI 0.1, 1.3) through reduced diarrhea, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI 0.1, 1.5) through reduced ARI with fever, and 1.8 percentage points (95% CI 0.5, 3.5) through reduced prevalence of enteric viruses. Interventions reduced antibiotic use through any mediator by 2.5 percentage points (95% CI 0.2, 5.3).

Black men and women have among the highest CRC incidence and mortality rates of any racial/ethnic group. This study will examine the impact of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on gut microbiota and fecal metabolites associated with CRC risk. METHODS: A generally healthy sample of non‐Hispanic Black and white adults (n = 112) is being recruited to participate in a parallel‐arm randomized controlled feeding study. Participants are randomized to receive the DASH diet or a standard American diet for a 28‐day period. Fecal samples are collected weekly throughout the study to analyze changes in the gut microbiota using 16 s rRNA and selected metagenomics. Differences in bacterial alpha and beta diversity and taxa that have been associated with CRC (Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, Porphyromonas, Succinivibrio) are being evaluated. Covariate measures include body mass index, comorbidities, medication history, physical activity, stress, and demographic characteristics. CONCLUSION: Our findings will provide preliminary evidence for the DASH diet as an approach for cultivating a healthier gut microbiota across non‐Hispanic Black and non‐Hispanic White adults. These results can impact clinical, translational, and population‐level approaches for modification of the gut microbiota to reduce risk of chronic diseases including CRC.

Materials and methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in 80 patients who required outpatient gynecological procedures (hysterosalpingography, office hysteroscopy). There were 2 randomized groups: a study group who before the manipulation received a 6‐day cycle of sanitizing therapy with a multicomponent local agent; a comparison group had no therapy. The formed groups were matched by age, parity, anamnestic data, and gynecological history. The Femoflor‐16 PCR‐RT assay was used to assess the microbiocenosis of the vagina and uterine cavity. Results: The total vaginal bacterial mass in the patients of both groups was lg 6.3 and 6.2 GE/sample (p=0.94). After the sanitizing therapy, the study group showed a decrease in the total vaginal bacterial contamination to lg 4.8 (Q1–Q3: 4.4–5.05) (p=0.03).

We investigated whether maternal and child secretor status are risk factors for poor child growth and whether they are effect modifiers of interventions on child environmental enteric dysfunction. In the WASH Benefits trial in rural Bangladesh, 720 clusters of 5551 pregnant women were randomized to 7 arms. We assessed 4 arms: control; combined water, sanitation, and handwashing intervention (WSH); nutrition intervention (N); and combined N+WSH. Across 1499 children, 68.2% were secretors (S), 21.5% nonsecretors (NS), and 10.3% inconclusive; across 1379 mothers, 64.8% were S, 22.3% NS, and 12.9% inconclusive. Measurements were taken at ages 3, 14, and 28 months, analyzed using generalized linear models adjusted for baseline confounders. Child NS status was associated with 0.10 SD lower length‐for‐age Z score (‐0.15, ‐0.05), 15% higher risk of stunting (1.06, 1.24), and 25% higher risk of severe stunting (1.02, 1.53).

We assessed the efficacy of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BLa80 in maltodextrin as a food supplement in regulating the intestinal habit of subjects with chronic constipation with type 1 or 2 stools on the Bristol scale index and/or less than three stools per week. A multicentre, randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trial was carried out in subjects aged 18 and over with chronic constipation. The study enrolled forty‐six subjects who were randomised one‐to‐one to receive the potential probiotic in maltodextrin (n = 23) or a placebo (n = 23). Investigators assessed changes in intestinal habits by analysing the mean number of weekly stools and the stool types according to the Bristol Scale. Patients reported constipation symptoms with PAC‐SYM (patient assessment of constipation ‐ symptoms), and the impact on quality of life with PAC‐QoL (patient assessment of constipation ‐ quality of life) and GI‐QLI (gastrointestinal quality of life index). Patients on the intervention group showed a greater tendency to normalise the type of stools than those in the placebo group. This difference towards regular stool types (type 3 and 4) was statistically significant at weeks 8 and 12 relative to week 4 (P‐values = 0.006 and 0.027, respectively). The proportion of constipated patients in the experimental group dropped over time, while the rate slightly increased in the placebo group in a statistically significant manner at week 12 relative to week 4 ( P = 0.037).

One proposed mechanism for these health benefits is via the microbiota, because WGW contains multiple fibers. WGW consumption has been proposed to ameliorate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, in which microbiota might play a role. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effect of WGW compared with RW intervention on the fecal microbiota composition and functionality, and correlated intervention‐induced changes in bacteria with changes in liver health parameters in adults with overweight or obesity. METHODS: We used data of a 12‐wk double‐blind, randomized, controlled, parallel trial to examine the effects of a WGW (98 g/d) or RW (98 g/d) intervention on the secondary outcomes fecal microbiota composition, predicted microbiota functionality, and stool consistency in 37 women and men (aged 45‐70 y, BMI 25‐35 kg/m2). The changes in microbiota composition, measured using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, after a 12‐wk intervention were analyzed with nonparametric tests, and correlated with changes in liver fat and circulating concentrations of liver enzymes including alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, γ‐glutamyltransferase, and serum amyloid A. RESULTS: The WGW intervention increased the mean (± SD) relative abundances of Ruminococcaceae_UCG‐014 (baseline: 2.2 ± 4.6%, differential change over time (Δ) 0.51 ± 4.2%), Ruminiclostridium_9 (baseline: 0.065 ± 0.11%, Δ 0.054 ± 0.14%), and Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group (baseline: 0.37 ± 0.56%, Δ 0.17 ± 0.83%), and also the predicted pathway acetyl‐CoA fermentation to butyrate II (baseline: 0.23 ± 0.062%, Δ 0.035 ± 0.059%), compared with the RW intervention (P values <0.05). A change in Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group was positively correlated with the change in liver fat, in both the WGW (ρ = 0.54; P = 0.026) and RW (ρ = 0.67; P = 0.024) groups. CONCLUSIONS: In middle‐aged overweight and obese adults, a 12‐wk WGW intervention increased the relative abundance of a number of bacterial taxa from the family Ruminococcaceae and increased predicted fermentation pathways when compared with an RW intervention. Potential protective health effects of replacement of RW by WGW on metabolic organs, such as the liver, via modulation of the microbiota, deserve further investigation.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02385149.",151,3,491‐502,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 33188417,EMBASE 633423730,,,,Journal article,"*fatty liver; *fermentation; *intestine flora; *intestine function; *obesity; *wheat; *whole grain; Adult; Aged; Alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; Biomarkers; Body mass; Clinical article; Controlled study; Dietary Fiber [administration & dosage]; Double blind procedure; Double‐Blind Method; Fatty Liver [*microbiology]; Feces [microbiology]; Feces microflora; Female; Flour; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Human; Humans; Liver [*metabolism, microbiology]; Male; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Middle Aged; Middle aged; Nonhuman; Nonparametric test; Outcome assessment; Overweight [*metabolism, microbiology]; RNA gene; Randomized controlled trial; Ruminococcaceae; Whole Grains",10.1093/jn/nxaa312,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02201484/full,

Methods: Twenty‐three patients undergo ESS and are randomly selected in each nostril either THP or SP packing. Symptoms including pain and nasal obstruction were evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) score by the patient and surgeon during weekly nasal toilette for 4 weeks. Post‐operative endoscopic evaluation on hemostasis score, infection and mucosal changes including recurrent polyps and adhesion done by 2 independent surgeons weekly via video endoscopic recording. Bacteria swab culture and sensitivity were taken 1 week postoperatively and mucosal biopsy from the designated middle meatus area was taken preoperatively and at 3rd‐week post surgery. Results: Patients VAS score showed a significant reduction in the symptoms of pain and nasal obstruction in the THP nasal cavity compared to the SP nostril. The surgeon also found that it is easier to perform nasal toilette in the THP nostril compared to SP. Endoscopic examination by 2 independent surgeons revealed a significant reduction in inflammation and bleeding in THP compared to SP in weekly follow‐ups. Interestingly, there was evidence of recurrent polyps in SP nasal mucosa and none in THP mucosa. Swab culture and sensitivity of the nasal mucosa showed significantly lower bacterial growth in THP. Histologically, pre‐ and post‐operative biopsy of the middle turbinate shows no significant difference in both groups.

The burden of child diarrhea in Bangladesh is still significant. Safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) can limit the events. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of WASH education of mothers or caregivers on child diarrhea. A community‐based randomized control trial was conducted in the selected households of a rural community in Dumki Upazila, Patuakhali from March–June 2019. A total of 202 mothers/caregivers received intervention and 202 did not receive intervention. A pre‐structured questionnaire was used to gather information on household WASH activities and diarrheal cases. Baseline data were collected first from the intervention group before providing education. WASH messages were given to the intervention group by face‐to‐face discussion. Both groups were followed up for diarrheal episodes for 3 months. Diarrheal prevalence of intervening group is compared with that of baseline and control. The results revealed that diarrheal prevalence was 11.4% (95% CI: 7.4–16.59%), 4.0% (95% CI: 1.7–7.65%), and 14.9% (95% CI: 10.25–20.52%) in baseline, intervention, and control group, respectively. Also, diarrhea was found lower in the intervention group than baseline (Z = − 2.524; P value = 0.012) and control (Z = − 1.85; P value = 0.04).

CN-02626793,"NCT06133530,","Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs) and Gut Microbiota, Immune System in Antarctica",https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06133530,2023,"The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of supplementation with prebiotics, a specific mixture of carbohydrates found in breast milk (HMOs), as a measure to improve intestinal flora, inflammatory processes in the gut, general immune status, carbohydrate regulation, fat and bone metabolism and neurological changes in Antarctica. The approximately one‐year stay at Concordia Station (Antarctica) at an altitude of about 3200 m includes a long journey and subsequent extreme environmental conditions as well as corresponding adaptation mechanisms and is therefore a very good terrestrial model (analogue model) for investigating changes during space stays. Long‐term (i.e. > 6 months) exposure to microgravity leads to numerous physiological responses, including impaired glucose tolerance, reduced immune function and bone loss, which can lead to quite severe health consequences. In this analogue model, similar changes, albeit less severe, are observed with regard to the immune system or glucose tolerance as in space flight. The composition of the diet significantly influences the composition of the intestinal flora. In particular, dietary carbohydrates provide the substrate for certain bacteria that could have a positive effect on health. Prebiotics are defined as substrates that are selectively used by host microorganisms and that provide health benefits. Prebiotics are digested only by gut microorganisms and stimulate the growth or activity of bacteria in the gut that have shown health benefits or improved well‐being. The main nutrients for bacterial growth are non‐digestible carbohydrates, which by definition are not digested by the host, in this case the human organism (host). Non‐digestible carbohydrates include, for example, resistant starch and dextrins, non‐starch polysaccharides (NSPs) (e.g. pectins) and non‐digestible oligosaccharides (e.g. Raffinose, inulin, etc.). These carbohydrates are fermented by the intestinal bacteria to short‐chain fatty acids (SCFAs), mainly acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid. This process takes place mainly in the large intestine, but also in the small intestine. SCFAs are rapidly absorbed by the mucosa of the large intestine and exert whole‐body effects, contributing, for example, to the host's energy needs or mediating gut‐brain communication, which has a major impact on the physiology and health of the host. HMOs are also prebiotics and are the third most abundant solid component in breast milk. Most of the research published to date on the effects of HMOs has therefore been conducted on infants. HMOs are not digested in the intestine and are mainly utilised in the large intestine by the bacteria that reside there. In infants, it has been shown that HMOs not only promote a healthy composition of the intestinal flora, but also impair the growth of pathogens and modulate the expression of genes involved in inflammation. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown antiviral properties of HMOs against various viruses such as rotavirus, norovirus, HIV and influenza. HMOs play a significant role in the immune system by enhancing the immune response. Initial applications of HMOs in adults have supported these findings. Therefore, this study aims to investigate how daily administration of 5.5 g of an HMO mixture during hibernation at Concordia Station in Antarctica affects: ‐ glucose tolerance ‐ inflammatory processes ‐ immune function ‐ fat and bone metabolism and ‐ Well‐being Study procedure This is a so‐called placebo‐controlled, randomised intervention study in parallel design. This means that subjects will be randomly selected to receive either the mixture of HMOs daily or a placebo. The study duration for a test person is approx. 20 months. It is divided into an examination phase before departure to Antarctica, approximately in September of a year, six phases during the wintering in Antarctica and one phase approximately 6 months after return. Each individual phase is identical, one example shown in Figure 1.

This amount is certified by the European Control Authority as safe for human consumption. The other group receives a corresponding placebo, Maltose. Measurement method Blood test and venous access Blood sampling from the peripheral vein is associated with the usual risks of venipuncture. These are haematomas or infections at the puncture site. When a peripheral venous access is placed, in rare cases there may be injuries to the vein (sclerotherapy) and the peripheric nerves. Blood collection and venous access are performed by an experienced doctor, which minimises the risk. Fasting blood collections Fasting blood samples for analysis of various blood parameters are taken on the same day as the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (see figure 1). Since several blood samples are taken for the OGTT, also after the drink has been taken, a venous access in the form of an indwelling venous cannula (small plastic tube) will be placed in the area of the forearm in order to avoid repeated puncturing of the arm veins. Glucose tolerance by means of an oral glucose tolerance test The so‐called oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) can be used to determine differences in glucose metabolism (sugar metabolism) between the intervention and control phases. On approximately day 3 of each study phase, a drink will be consumed in the morning, fasting state, which is prepared from 75 g glucose (Medicalfox Gluko 75 powder) and 300 ml drinking water. Blood is taken every 15 minutes in the first hour after the drink is given, and every 30 minutes in the second hour. Saliva sample Saliva samples will be taken to test certain hormones that reflect stress levels, as well as the reactivity of certain viruses (herpes virus, rotavirus). For this purpose, a small cotton wool roll from a prepared container (salivette) is chewed in the mouth for several minutes and returned to the collection tube once during the examination phase. The saliva obtained is frozen and later analysed in the laboratory. Faecal collection In order to examine the changes in the intestinal flora, faeces samples are taken on 3 consecutive days in each phase. For this purpose, a so‐called 'Feces Catcher' is placed over the toilet to better collect the faeces. Three samples are then taken from these faeces in 3 different tubes. The small spoon in each tube is filled with faeces, put back into the tube, closed and frozen. Documentation of the diet In order to be able to estimate the influence of the food composition on the intestinal flora, the food consumed is documented on 2 working days and one weekend day. This is done in a prepared dietlog.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT06133530,,,Trial registry record,,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02626793/full,

Newer guidelines recommend IBS as a positive diagnosis based on symptoms with limited testing. We investigated the long‐term safety and impact on use of health resources of a positive diagnostic strategy compared to a strategy of exclusion in patients with symptoms compatible with IBS. Methods: In 2008‐2010, primary care patients aged 18‐50 years fulfilling the Rome III criteria for IBS without alarm signals were randomized to a positive diagnostic strategy (limited blood tests, n = 150) or a strategy of exclusion (extensive blood tests, fecal samples for intestinal parasites, and sigmoidoscopy with biopsies, n = 152). At five years, hospital‐registered diagnoses and use of health resources including lower endoscopies were retrieved from national registries. Participants provided 5‐year data on Rome III criteria for IBS, severity of symptoms, and quality of life. Key results: Baseline mean age was 31.4 (SD 9.1) years; 79% were female. No cases of celiac disease, and gastrointestinal or gynecological cancers were diagnosed within five years. Negligible and comparable numbers were diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, benign gynecological conditions, and upper GI conditions in the two groups. The positive diagnosis strategy carried a higher number of lower endoscopies from year 1 to 5 (23 patients versus 13 patients in the exclusion group), but overall saved endoscopies.

We conducted a randomized prospective study with 2 objectives: (i) to investigate epithelial barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation induced by cardiopulmonary bypass and changes in the gut microbiota and (ii) to verify whether probiotics can improve these conditions. METHODS: Between 2019 and 2020, patients 0‐15 years old scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled and randomly allocated to 2 groups: the intervention group received probiotics and the control group did not receive probiotics. We analysed the microbiota in faeces and blood, organic acid concentrations in faeces, plasma intestinal fatty acid‐binding protein and immunological responses. RESULTS: Eighty‐two patients were enrolled in this study. The characteristics of the patients were similar in both groups. The total number of obligate anaerobes was higher in the intervention group than in the control group after postoperative day 7. We identified 4 clusters within the perioperative gut microbiota, and cluster changes showed a corrective effect of probiotics on dysbiosis after postoperative day 7. Organic acid concentrations in faeces, incidence of bacterial translocation, intestinal fatty acid‐binding protein levels and immunological responses, except for interleukin ‐17A, were not markedly different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of probiotics was able to correct dysbiosis but did not sufficiently alleviate the intestinal damage induced by cardiopulmonary bypass. More effective methods should be examined to prevent disturbances induced by cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass.

The SINFONI project investigates a multifunctional (MF) nutritional strategy's impact combining different bioactive compounds on inflammation, GM modulation and CM profile. In this randomized crossover‐controlled study, 30 subjects at CM‐risk consumed MF cereal‐products, enriched with polyphenols, fibers, slowly‐digestible starch, omega‐3 fatty acids or Control cereal‐products (without bioactive compounds) for 2 months. Metabolic endotoxemia (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipopolysaccharide‐binding protein over soluble cluster of differentiation‐14 (LBP/sCD14), systemic inflammation and cardiovascular risk markers, intestinal inflammation, CM profile and response to a one‐week fructose supplementation, were assessed at fasting and post mixed‐meal. GM composition and metabolomic analysis were conducted. Mixed linear models were employed, integrating time (pre/post), treatment (MF/control), and sequence/period. Compared to control, MF intervention reduced intestinal inflammation (fecal calprotectin, p = 0.007) and endotoxemia (fasting LPS, p < 0.05), without alteration of systemic inflammation.

In the human gut microbiome, phages have been implicated in influencing human health, with successful engraftment of donor phages correlated with FMT treatment efficacy. The impact that gastrointestinal phages exert on human health has primarily been connected to their ability to modulate the bacterial communities in the gut. Nonetheless, how FMT affects recipients' phage populations, and in turn, how this influences the gut environment, is not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of FMT on the phageome composition of participants within the Gut Bugs Trial (GBT), a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled trial that investigated the efficacy of FMT in treating obesity and comorbidities in adolescents. Stool samples collected from donors at the time of treatment and recipients at four time points (i.e., baseline and 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 26 weeks post‐intervention), underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Phage sequences were identified and characterized in silico to examine evidence of phage engraftment and to assess the extent of FMT‐induced alterations in the recipients' phageome composition. RESULTS: Donor phages engrafted stably in recipients following FMT, composing a significant proportion of their phageome for the entire course of the study (33.8 ± 1.2% in females and 33.9 ± 3.7% in males). Phage engraftment varied between donors and donor engraftment efficacy was positively correlated with their phageome alpha diversity. FMT caused a shift in recipients' phageome toward the donors' composition and increased phageome alpha diversity and variability over time. CONCLUSIONS: FMT significantly altered recipients' phage and, overall, microbial populations. The increase in microbial diversity and variability is consistent with a shift in microbial population dynamics. This proposes that phages play a critical role in modulating the gut environment and suggests novel approaches to understanding the efficacy of FMT in altering the recipient's microbiome.

We conducted a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled crossover trial (NCT03582306) in individuals with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 and high habitual red meat intake and low habitual green leafy vegetable (GLV) intake. METHODS: Participants were provided with frozen GLV during the first or last four weeks (immediate or delayed intervention) of the twelve‐week trial. Biological and anthropometric measures were taken at the beginning and at each four‐week interval. A subset of 20 participants was selected for this secondary analysis of the intestinal permeability and inflammation‐related biomarkers: serum and fecal zonulin; serum lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), Alpha‐1‐acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM‐1), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), and C‐reactive protein; 8‐hydroxy‐2'‐deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) and plasma Vitamin K1 as a marker of protocol adherence. Nutrient and food group intake from two‐24‐h dietary recalls collected at each time point were assessed. Fecal microbiota was measured by 16 s rRNA PCR sequencing. Changes in biological markers, dietary factors, and microbial taxa were assessed with Wilcoxon Sign Ranks Tests. Exploratory analyses of the relationship between changes in outcome variables were conducted with Spearman correlations. RESULTS: No changes in serum and fecal zonulin and serum LBP were observed. Plasma Vitamin K (p = 0.005) increased, while plasma 8OHdG (p = 0.023) decreased during the intervention compared to the control. The only dietary factors that changed significantly were increases during intervention in Vitamin K and Dark GLV (p < 0.001 for both) compared to control. Fecal microbiota did not change significantly across all times points; however, change in serum zonulin was associated with change in Proteobacteria (ρ = ‐ 0.867, p = 0.001) in females and Bifidobacterium (ρ = ‐ 0.838, p = 0.009) and Bacteroidaceae (ρ = 0.871, p = 0.005) in men. CONCLUSIONS: A high GLV dietary intervention increased serum zonulin levels and had no effect on fecal zonulin. Lack of concordance between several inflammation‐associated biomarkers and zonulin corroborate recent reports of limited utility of zonulin in obese adults free of lower gastrointestinal disease.

Design: A double‐blind, randomised controlled 4‐week study involving 58 postmenopausal women was used to assess the chronic effects of milk PL consumption (0, 3 or 5 g‐PL/day) on lipid metabolism and gut microbiota. The acute effects of milk PL on intestinal absorption and metabolism of cholesterol were assessed in a randomised controlled crossover study using tracers in ileostomy patients. Results: Over 4 weeks, milk PL significantly reduced fasting and postprandial plasma concentrations of cholesterol and surrogate lipid markers of cardiovascular disease risk, including total/high‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol and apolipoprotein (Apo)B/ApoA1 ratios. The highest PL dose preferentially induced a decreased number of intestine‐derived chylomicron particles. Also, milk PL increased faecal loss of coprostanol, a gut‐derived metabolite of cholesterol, but major bacterial populations and faecal short‐chain fatty acids were not affected by milk PL, regardless of the dose. Acute ingestion of milk PL by ileostomy patients shows that milk PL decreased cholesterol absorption and increased cholesterol‐ileal efflux, which can be explained by the observed co‐excretion with milk sphingomyelin in the gut. Conclusion: The present data demonstrate for the first time in humans that milk PL can improve the cardiometabolic health by decreasing several lipid cardiovascular markers, notably through a reduced intestinal cholesterol absorption involving specific interactions in the gut, without disturbing the major bacterial phyla of gut microbiota.

Postprandial metabolic explorations were performed before and after supplementation. Analyses included SM and Cer species in serum, chylomicrons, and feces. The ileal contents of 4 ileostomy patients were also explored after acute milk PL intake.RESULTSMilk PL decreased serum atherogenic C24:1 Cer, C16:1 SM, and C18:1 SM species (Pgroup < 0.05). Changes in serum C16+18 SM species were positively correlated with the reduction of cholesterol (r = 0.706), LDL‐C (r = 0.666), and ApoB (r = 0.705) (P < 0.001).

Currently, the possibility of regulating gut microbiota to reverse these perturbations by developing novel therapeutic and preventive strategies is being extensively investigated. The modulatory effect of vitamins on the gut microbiome and related host health benefits remain largely unclear. We investigated the effects of colon‐delivered vitamins A, B2, C, D, and E on the gut microbiota using a human clinical study and batch fermentation experiments, in combination with cell models for the assessment of barrier and immune functions. Vitamins C, B2, and D may modulate the human gut microbiome in terms of metabolic activity and bacterial composition. The most distinct effect was that of vitamin C, which significantly increased microbial alpha diversity and fecal short‐chain fatty acids compared to the placebo. The remaining vitamins tested showed similar effects on microbial diversity, composition, and/or metabolic activity in vitro, but in varying degrees. Here, we showed that vitamins may modulate the human gut microbiome. Follow‐up studies investigating targeted delivery of vitamins to the colon may help clarify the clinical significance of this novel concept for treating and preventing dysbiotic microbiota‐related human diseases.

Here we examined the effect of NACP combined into antibacterial/rechargeable sealant formulations on the mineral content of artificial carious enamel during pH‐cycling mimicking intraoral conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NACP and a quaternary ammonium methacrylate (DMAHDM) were synthesized. Three resin sealants were formulated: ""base formulation"" (without NACP and DMAHDM, used as control); ""NACP on the base formulation"" (with 20 wt.% NACP); ""NACP on the antibacterial formulation"" (with 20 wt.% NACP and 5 wt.% DMAHDM). Standardized enamel windows on sealed non‐carious human molars were demineralized and randomly divided into four groups: three groups of teeth sealed with the experimental materials and one group of teeth without sealant application used as negative control. The teeth were exposed to pH cycling regime. The changes in the mineral content of enamel were assessed by quantitative surface hardness loss in percentage (%SHL) and qualitative analyses via scanning electron microscopy/energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (SEM‐EDX) and polarized light microscopy (PLM). RESULTS: The contact with NACP‐containing formulations provoked significant lower %SHL on sealed enamel (p < 0.05) in comparison to control groups. This outcome was supported by the results of SEM‐EDX, in which the enamel presented higher percentages of calcium and phosphate than control groups. PLM showed less enamel superficial demineralization around the sealants containing NACP. CONCLUSION: NACP incorporated into an antibacterial sealant protected the enamel against demineralization. pH‐responsive calcium and phosphate‐ion releasing sealants with antimicrobial and rechargeable properties may be a reliable complementary approach for caries management.

Consequently, it exerts detrimental effects on a part of the worldwide population who are afflicted with celiac disease (1%) or related disorders (5%), particularly due to the potential for cross‐contamination even when adhering to a gluten‐free diet (GFD). Finding solutions to break down gluten during digestion has a high nutritional and social impact. Here, a randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled in vivo challenge investigated the gluten‐degrading activity of a novel probiotic preparation comprising lactobacilli and their cytoplasmic extracts, Bacillus sp., and bacterial protease. In our clinical trial, we collected feces from 70 healthy volunteers at specific time intervals. Probiotic/placebo administration lasted 32 days, followed by 10 days of wash‐out. After preliminary GFD to eliminate residual gluten from feces, increasing amounts of gluten (50 mg‐10 g) were administered, each one for 4 consecutive days. Compared to placebo, the feces of volunteers fed with probiotics showed much lower amounts of residual gluten, mainly with increased intakes. Probiotics also regulate the intestinal microbial communities, improving the abundance of genera pivotal to maintaining homeostasis. Quantitative PCR confirmed that all probiotics persisted during the intervention, some also during wash‐out. Probiotics promoted a fecal metabolome with potential immunomodulating activity, mainly related to derivatives of branched‐chain amino acids and short‐chain fatty acids. IMPORTANCE: The untapped potential of gluten‐degrading bacteria and their application in addressing the recognized limitations of gluten‐related disorder management and the ongoing risk of cross‐contamination even when people follow a gluten‐free diet (GFD) emphasizes the significance of the work. Because gluten, a common protein found in many cereals, must be strictly avoided to stop autoimmune reactions and related health problems, celiac disease and gluten sensitivity present difficult hurdles. However, because of the hidden presence of gluten in many food products and the constant danger of cross‐contamination during food preparation and processing, total avoidance is frequently challenging.

OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the effects of a low glycemic load (LGL) compared with a high glycemic load (HGL) dietary pattern on stool bacterial community structure and metabolism. METHODS: Participants in this crossover‐controlled feeding study were healthy men and women (n = 69). We identified genera, species, and genes and transcripts of metabolic pathways and bacterial enzymes using 16S rRNA gene, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis. RESULTS: Overall community structure measured by alpha and beta diversity was not significantly different across the diets, although diet did significantly increase the abundance of 13 of 161 genera (Padj < 0.05) and 5 species in the LGL diet and 7 species in the HGL diet. Gene expression in the hexitol fermentation pathway (β = ‐1.15; SE = 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI]: ‐1.63, ‐0.67; Padj = 0.002) was significantly higher in the HGL diet, whereas expression in the L‐lysine biosynthesis pathway (β = 0.20; SE = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.30; Padj = 0.03) was enriched in the LGL diet. The beta diversity of expressed carbohydrate‐active enzymes (CAZymes) was significantly different between the diets (MiRKAT, P < 0.001). CAZymes enriched in the HGL diet reflected dietary additives, whereas CAZymes enriched in the LGL diet reflected diverse phytochemical intake. There was a significant interaction between homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR) and the coenzyme A biosynthesis I pathway involved in bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis (Padj = 0.035), which was positive in the HGL diet (b = 0.20; SE = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.39) and negative in the LGL diet (β = ‐0.23; SE = 0.09; 95% CI: ‐0.40, ‐0.06).

The uricolysis of gut microbiota plays an important role in extrarenal excretion of UA. This study aimed to examine the effect of inulin‐type prebiotics (a type of fermentable dietary fiber) on intestinal microbiota modulation and serum UA levels in ESRD patients. Methods: Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients were recruited to a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled crossover trial of 12‐week inulin‐type prebiotics. Participants were visited before and after treatment with prebiotics or placebo. Serum UA levels, dietary purine intake, serum xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, daily ?renal excretion? of UA, and fecal UA degradation capability were measured at each visit. Fecal metagenomic analysis was conducted to assess microbial composition and function. Results: Sixteen participants (mean age = 37 y; 10 men and 6 women) completed the trial, and 64 specimens were analyzed. The average concentration of serum UA decreased by approximately 10% in the prebiotic intervention group in comparison to the placebo group (p = 0.047) without an increase in daily ?renal excretion? of UA via urine and dialysate. There were no significant changes in purine intake or activity of XO. Notably, enhanced fecal UA degradation was observed after prebiotic intervention (p = 0.041), and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, which was positively associated with fecal UA degradation, increased in the prebiotic period (p = 0.032). Furthermore, prebiotics enriched purine‐degrading species in the gut microbiota, including unclassified_o_Clostridiales, Clostridium sp. CAG:7, Clostridium sp.

Conclusions: Inulin‐type prebiotics is a promising therapeutic candidate to reduce serum UA levels in renal failure patients, and this urate‐lowering effect could possibly be attributed to intestinal microbial degradation of UA.

Based on the world health organization estimates, diarrhea contributes to more than one in every ten (13%) child deaths in Ethiopia. Despite the emphasis given to improving child health, many children are still dying due to easily preventable and treatable diarrheal disease in Ethiopia. Methods: A community cross‐sectional study was conducted on randomly selected under‐five children who live in Wonago district. Three hundred eighteen households were selected using a systematic sampling technique. Data were collected using a structured closed‐ended questionnaire. Data were cleaned, coded, and entered into the statistical package for social sciences window version 20 statistical software analysis. Results: The magnitude of moderate to severe diarrhea in the Wonago district was 30.9%. The number of family members (AOR: 2.7, 95% CI [1.277–5.716]), presence of animals in households (AOR: 2.591, 95% CI [1.188–5.650]), availability of latrine (AOR: 2.129, 95% CI [1.006–4.505]), and hand washing practice during a critical time (AOR: 2.683, 95% CI [1.139–6.319]) were strongly associated with moderate to severe diarrhea.

More recently, it has become clear that they can also affect health via their impact on the microbiota and inflammation. This may explain some of their clinical benefits despite global increases in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and reduced antimicrobial effectiveness. We showed in a randomized controlled trial of stopping versus continuing cotrimoxazole prophylaxis among HIV‐positive Zimbabwean children taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), that continuation of cotrimoxazole persistently suppressed gut‐resident viridans group streptococcal species (VGS) that were associated with intestinal inflammation. In this addendum, we provide a broader overview of how antibiotics can shape the microbiota and use high read‐depth whole metagenome sequencing data from our published study to investigate whether (i) the impact of cotrimoxazole on gut VGS and (ii) VGS associated inflammation, is attributable to strain‐level variability. We focus on S. salivarius, the VGS species that was most prevalent in the cohort and for which there was sufficient genome coverage to differentiate strains. We demonstrate that suppression of S. salivarius by cotrimoxazole is not strain specific, nor did stool concentration of the pro‐inflammatory mediator myeloperoxidase vary by S. salivarius strain. We also show that gut‐resident S. salivarius strains present in this study population are distinct from common oral strains. This is the first analysis of how cotrimoxazole prophylaxis used according to international treatment guidelines for children living with HIV influences the gut microbiome at the strain‐level. We also provide a detailed review of the literature on the mechanisms by which suppression of VGS may act synergistically with cotrimoxazole's anti‐inflammatory effects to reduce gut inflammation.

This dietary relation may be modulated by compositional changes in the gut microbiota; however, no human study has addressed this hypothesis. We determined the feasibility of a randomized crossover trial to evaluate the effect of three interventions (combined calcium and inulin supplementation, calcium supplementation alone, and inulin supplementation alone) on the intestinal microbiota composition and function. We conducted a 16‐week pilot study in 12 healthy adults who consumed the three interventions in a random sequence. Participants provided fecal and blood samples before and after each intervention. Each intervention period lasted four weeks and was flanked by one‐week washout periods. 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and quantification of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) was determined in fecal samples. Systemic lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) was quantified in serum. Of the 12 individuals assigned to an intervention sequence, seven completed the study. Reasons for dropout included time (n = 3), gastrointestinal discomfort (n = 1), and moving (n = 1). Overall, participants reported positive attitudes towards the protocol (n = 9) but were unsatisfied by the practicalities of supplement consumption (44%) and experienced digestive discomfort (56%). We found no appreciable differences in microbial composition, SCFA concentration, nor LBP concentrations when comparing intervention periods.

Freezing the FMT preparation simplifies the process, allowing a single stool sample to be used for multiple receivers and over an extended period of time. We aimed to assess the effect of long‐term frozen storage on bacterial taxonomic profiles of a stool suspension prepared for FMT. Methods: DNA was extracted from a stool suspension before freezing and sequentially during the 18‐month storage period at ‐80°C. Two different protocols were used for DNA extraction. The first relied on a classical mechanical and chemical cell disruption to extract both intra‐ and extracellular DNA; the second included specific pre‐treatments aimed at removing free DNA and DNA from human and damaged bacterial cells. Taxonomic profiling of bacterial communities was performed by sequencing of V3‐V4 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Results: Microbiota profiles obtained by whole DNA extraction procedure remained relatively stable during frozen storage. When DNA extraction procedure included specific pre‐treatments, microbiota similarity between fresh and frozen samples progressively decreased with longer frozen storage times; notably, the abundance of Bacteroidetes decreased in a storage duration‐dependent manner. The abundance of Firmicutes, the main butyrate producers in the colon, were not much affected by frozen storage for up to 1 year. Conclusion: Our data show that metataxonomic analysis of frozen stool suspensions subjected to specific pre‐treatments prior to DNA extractions might provide an interesting indication of bacterial resistance to stress conditions and thus of chances of survival in FMT recipients.",10,,77,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 32185143,EMBASE 631190371,,,,Journal article,"*feces analysis; *microflora; *storage; Amplicon; Article; Bacteria [*classification, isolation & purification]; Bacterial cell; Bacterial gene; Bacteroidetes [*genetics, isolation & purification]; Bioinformatics; Cell disruption; Clinical article; Controlled study; Cryopreservation [methods]; DNA binding; DNA extraction; DNA purification; DNA sequence; DNA, Bacterial [genetics]; Fecal Microbiota Transplantation; Fecal microbiota transplantation; Feces [*microbiology]; Feces microflora; Firmicutes [*genetics, isolation & purification]; Gene sequence; Human; Humans; Information processing; Microbial community; Microbial diversity; Microbiota; Nonhuman; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymerase chain reaction; Population abundance; RNA gene; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S [genetics]; Randomized controlled trial; Specimen Handling [methods]; Suspensions; Time Factors",10.3389/fcimb.2020.00077,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02097566/full,

OBJECTIVES: Here, we hypothesize that the Mediterranean diet, possibly via the induction of short‐chain fatty acids (SCFAs), improves intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, we aim to establish novel personalized nutrition advice based on machine learning algorithms. METHODS: We studied 260 women with intestinal barrier impairment. The women were allocated to follow either a Mediterranean diet or a control diet for 3 mo. Intestinal permeability was assessed by measuring lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) in plasma and zonulin in feces. SCFA concentrations were analyzed in feces. Bi‐ and multivariate analyses and machine learning algorithms (random forest classification) were conducted. RESULTS: Particularly in the intervention group, adherence to the Mediterranean diet increased, whereas plasma LBP and fecal zonulin concentrations decreased (all q < 0.001 for the intervention group, all q < 0.1 for control group). In the intervention group, fecal SCFA concentrations increased (propionate + 19%; butyrate + 44%; both q < 0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with SCFA concentrations (all q < 0.001) and inversely associated with LBP and zonulin concentrations (all q < 0.02). Mediation analyses identified propionate and butyrate as the key mechanistic link between diet and intestinal permeability integrity. Accordingly, using baseline SCFA data, we could predict the effect of the Mediterranean diet on intestinal permeability using a machine learning algorithm (receiver operating characteristic AUC: 0.78‐0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that SCFAs are key mediators for the relation between diet and gut health. Assessment of SCFAs may form a basis for personalized nutrition in future clinical care. These results need to be verified in larger studies powered for this purpose, comprising different study populations.

A previous study on consuming H. coagulans SANK70258 together with galactooligosaccharides showed a trend toward improvement in skin scaliness scores and subjective assessments of skin roughness. However, the effect of H. coagulans SANK70258 alone on the skin remains unclear.

METHODS: This placebo‐controlled, double‐blind clinical trial involved 80 Japanese women aged 30 to 65 with perceived skin roughness. Participants were divided into placebo and test groups. Over eight weeks, the test group consumed H. coagulans SANK70258, and its effects on skin condition and intestinal health were examined. RESULTS: The probiotic group showed significant intestinal improvements, with reduced fecal phenol levels (p = 0.044) and pH (p = 0.022), as well as enhanced skin lightness (L* value) (p = 0.040) and liver function tests.

However, other microbial population such as gut fungi (mycobiome) in relation to MCI/AD pathology, gut bacteria and diet remain unknown. Methods: We measure gut mycobiome by sequencing of the fungal rRNA ITS1 gene in 17 older adults (11 MCI; 6 cognitively normal [CN]) in a single‐center, randomized, double‐blind, crossover pilot study, before and after 6 weeks intervention of MMKD and American Heart Association Diet (AHAD), and determine its correlation with AD markers in CSF and gut bacteria. Findings: Compared to CN counterparts, patients with MCI have higher proportion of families Sclerotiniaceae, Phaffomyceteceae, Trichocomaceae, Cystofilobasidiaceae, Togniniaceae and genera Botrytis, Kazachstania, Phaeoacremonium and Cladosporium and lower abundance of Meyerozyma. Specific fungal taxa exhibit distinct correlation arrays with AD markers and gut bacteria in subjects with versus without MCI. MMKD induces broader effect on fungal diversity in subjects with MCI and increases Agaricus and Mrakia while decreasing Saccharomyces and Claviceps with differential response in subjects with or without MCI. Interpretation: The study reveals MCI‐specific mycobiome signatures and demonstrates that distinct diets modulate the mycobiome in association with AD markers and fungal‐bacterial co‐regulation networks in patients with MCI.

A Three-Arm, Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial",Helicobacter,2025,"BACKGROUND: Rising antimicrobial resistance has significantly challenged the eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori. Due to its invasive nature, susceptibility testing based on endoscopic biopsy is controversial, while few studies have focused on the efficacy of tailored bismuth quadruple therapies (BQT) based on fecal susceptibility testing as a first‐line treatment. METHODS: In this multicenter study, 598 H. pylori‐positive patients without previous eradication treatment were recruited and randomly assigned to three groups: empirical BQT, BQT‐tailored based on the history of clarithromycin use and tailored based on fecal molecular susceptibility testing where furazolidone was substituted for clarithromycin when there was clinical or laboratory evidence of clarithromycin resistance. This study defines BQT as regimens comprising rabeprazole, colloidal bismuth, amoxicillin, and one additional antibiotic (furazolidone or clarithromycin). The study assessed eradication rates using intention‐to‐treat (ITT), modified intention‐to‐treat (mITT), and per‐protocol (PP) analyses. RESULTS: The eradication rates of three groups were 82.00%, 80.90%, and 87.44% in the ITT analysis; 82.41%, 83.42%, and 89.23% in the mITT analysis; and 85.86%, 87.50%, and 94.57% in the PP analysis, respectively. Tailored BQT based on fecal susceptibility testing was not inferior to empirical BQT (all p values for noninferiority < 0.001) and demonstrated greater efficacy in the PP analysis (difference [95% CI]: 7.07% [0.90%, 13.25%]). The incidence of adverse events and treatment compliance did not differ significantly among the groups. CONCLUSION: Tailored BQT based on fecal susceptibility testing is an effective regimen for H. pylori eradication, with no increase in adverse events or treatment noncompliance compared with empirical BQT. Therefore, we recommend tailored BQT based on fecal susceptibility testing as a first‐line treatment.

Dietary supplementation with soluble fiber is one of several proposed modulation strategies. This study aims at confirming the impact of the resistant dextrin NUTRIOSE (RD), a soluble fiber with demonstrated beneficial health effects, on the gut microbiota of healthy individuals. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty healthy women are enrolled and supplemented daily with either RD (n = 24) or a control product (n = 26) during 6 weeks. Characterization of the fecal metagenome with shotgun sequencing reveals that RD intake dramatically increases the abundance of the commensal bacterium Parabacteroides distasonis. Furthermore, presence in metagenomes of accessory genes from P. distasonis, coding for susCD (a starch‐binding membrane protein complex) is associated with a greater increase of the species. This suggests that response to RD might be strain‐dependent. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with RD can be used to specifically increase P. distasonis in gut microbiota of healthy women. The magnitude of the response may be associated with fiber‐metabolizing capabilities of strains carried by subjects. Further research will seek to confirm that P. distasonis directly modulates the clinical effects observed in other studies.",66,11,e2101091,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 35312171,EMBASE 637558800,,,,Journal article,*Dextrins [pharmacology]; *Dietary Supplements; *Parabacteroides distasonis; *diet supplementation; *intestine flora; *metagenomics; Accessory gene; Adult; Article; Bacterial strain; Bacteroidetes; Clinical article; Commensal; Controlled study; Diet; Drug therapy; Feces; Feces [microbiology]; Female; Human; Human experiment; Humans; Metagenome; Nonhuman; Shotgun sequencing,10.1002/mnfr.202101091,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02399292/full,

Several studies suggest that gut microbiota may influence AD by immune system regulation. METHODS: We performed the first in‐human efficacy and safety assessment of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for AD adult patients. All patients received 2 placebo transplantations followed by 4 FMTs each 2 weeks apart. AD severity and fecal microbiome profile were evaluated by the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis Score (SCORAD), the weekly frequency of topical corticosteroids usage, and gut microbiota metagenomic analysis, at the study beginning, before every FMT, and 1‐8 months after the last FMT. RESULTS: Nine patients completed the study protocol. There was no significant change in the SCORAD score following the two placebo transplants. The average SCORAD score significantly decreased from baseline at Weeks 4‐12 (before and 2 weeks after 4 times of FMT) (59.2 ± 34.9%, Wilcoxon p = .011), 50% and 75% decrease was achieved by 7 (77%) and 4 (44%) patients, respectively. At Week 18 (8 weeks after the last FMT) the average SCORAD score decreased from baseline at Week 4 (85.5 ± 8.4%, Wilcoxon p = .018), 50% and 75% decrease was achieved by 7 (77%) and 6 (66.7%) patients respectively. Weekly topical corticosteroids usage was diminished during the study and follow‐up period as well. Two patients had a quick relapse and were switched to a different treatment. Two patients developed exacerbations alleviated after an additional fifth FMT. Metagenomic analysis of the fecal microbiota of patients and donors showed bacterial strains transmission from donors to patients.

A randomized double blinded phase I clinical trial",PloS one,2023,"BACKGROUND: Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is recommended treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection and is studied as a potential modifier of other gastrointestinal and systemic disorders. Autologous FMT limits the potential risks of donor transplant material and enables prophylactic treatment. Capsulized FMT is convenient and accessible, but safety data are lacking. AIMS: To describe safety and tolerability of capsules containing autologous FMT, compared to placebo, in healthy volunteers treated with antibiotics. METHOD: Healthy volunteers without antibiotic exposure during the past three months, that had a negative Clostridioides difficile stool sample, were recruited. Study persons donated faeces for production of capsules containing autologous microbiota. They were then given Clindamycin for seven days to disrupt the intestinal microbiota, which was followed by a two‐day washout. Study persons were then randomized (1:1) to unsupervised treatment with autologous faecal matter or placebo, with two capsules twice daily for five days. A standardized questionnaire about side effects and tolerability, daily until day 28, and on days 60 and 180, was completed. RESULTS: Twenty‐four study persons were included, all completed the treatment. One person from the placebo and FMT groups each, were lost to follow up from days 21 and 60, respectively. No study person experienced serious side effects, but severe fatigue was reported during the antibiotic period (n = 2). Reported side effects were mild to moderate and there were no significant differences between the groups. Reported general and intestinal health improved significantly and similarly in both groups after the antibiotic treatment. Time to normalized intestinal habits were 17 and 19 days from study start in the placebo group and the FMT group, respectively (p = 0.8). CONCLUSION: Capsulized frozen autologous faecal microbiota transplantation was safe and well tolerated but did not affect time to normalized intestinal habits compared to placebo.

This study aims to investigate the adjunctive therapeutic effects of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum MH‐301 in H. pylori eradication therapy, as well as its effects on the gut and vaginal microbiota. METHOD: 257 sexually active, premenopausal women aged 18‐50 years, diagnosed with H. pylori infection alongside chronic gastritis, were randomly allocated to undergo either bismuth‐containing quadruple therapy (amoxicillin, furazolidone, potassium bismuth citrate, rabeprazole) combined with probiotics (L. plantarum MH‐301) or a placebo for 14 days. Stool samples and vaginal swabs were collected before and after treatment to facilitate high‐throughput sequencing analysis. RESULT: The probiotic group exhibited lower incidences of bloating (10.2% vs 19.4%, P=0.037), constipation (2.3% vs 7.8%, P =0.048), and excessive vaginal discharge (3.1% vs 9.3%, P=0.040), and showed better treatment tolerability compared to the placebo group (P<0.05), although no statistically significant difference in eradication rates between the two groups. High‐throughput sequencing revealed that H. pylori eradication therapy led to a decrease in the relative abundance of Prevotella in the gut microbiota, and an increase in Streptococcus and Haemophilus. In the vaginal microbiota, Lactobacillus decreased while Gardnerella increased. Compared to the placebo group, the probiotic group showed a higher relative abundance of Megamonas, Prevotella, and Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota, and lower levels of Streptococcus and Haemophilus. In the vaginal microbiota, Gardnerella was significantly lower (P<0.05). Correlation analysis revealed a positive association between gastrointestinal and vaginal adverse events, and a positive correlation of Lactobacillus in both gut and vaginal microbiota (P<0.05).

The main energy sources for colonic bacteria are dietary polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. These play a major role in modulating gut microbial composition and metabolism, which in turn can impact on health outcomes. RESULTS: We investigated the influence of wheat bran arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOS) and maltodextrin supplements in modulating the composition of the colonic microbiota and metabolites in healthy adults over the age of 60. Male and female volunteers, (n = 21, mean BMI 25.2 ± 0.7 kg/m2) participated in the double‐blind, cross over supplement study. Faecal samples were collected for analysis of microbiota, short chain fatty acids levels and calprotectin. Blood samples were collected to measure glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides levels. There was no change in these markers nor in calprotectin levels in response to the supplements. Both supplements were well‐tolerated by the volunteers. Microbiota analysis across the whole volunteer cohort revealed a significant increase in the proportional abundance of faecal Bifidobacterium species (P ≤ 0.01) in response to AXOS, but not maltodextrin, supplementation. There was considerable inter‐individual variation in the other bacterial taxa that responded, with a clear stratification of volunteers as either Prevotella‐plus (n = 8; > 0.1% proportional abundance) or Prevotella‐minus (n = 13; ≤0.1% proportional abundance) subjects founded on baseline sample profiles. There was a significant increase in the proportional abundance of both faecal Bifidobacterium (P ≤ 0.01) and Prevotella species (P ≤ 0.01) in Prevotella‐plus volunteers during AXOS supplementation, while Prevotella and Bacteroides relative abundances showed an inverse relationship. Proportional abundance of 26 OTUs, including bifidobacteria and Anaerostipes hadrus, differed significantly between baseline samples of Prevotella‐plus compared to Prevotella‐minus individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The wheat bran AXOS supplementation was bifidogenic and resulted in changes in human gut microbiota composition that depended on the initial microbiota profile, specifically the presence or absence of Prevotella spp. as a major component of the microbiota. Our data therefore suggest that initial profiling of individuals through gut microbiota analysis should be considered important when contemplating nutritional interventions that rely on prebiotics.

In low‐and middle‐income countries, children experience a dis‐proportionally high burden of exposure to poverty and related risk factors for delayed development including of poor health and nutrition, inadequate responsive care giving, and a lack of opportunities for early learning. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions have the potential to positively affect the developmental trajectories of children by reducing enteric pathogen infection, improving child health, and altering parental care practices. A recent cluster‐randomized controlled trial (cRCT) in Bangladesh (WASH‐Benefits, or WASH‐B, Clinical Trials.gov Identifier: NCT01590095), found that improvements in WASH or nutrition supported by intensive interpersonal communication, when delivered either individually or in combination, contributed to improvements in child development outcomes at 1 and 2 years of age, and mothers in all intervention groups reported lower depressive symptoms than mothers in the control households.

OBJECTIVES: This paper descriptively presents the baseline status of one‐week incidence and prevelence of diarrhoea water, sanitation and hygiene and their determinants. METHODS: Recruited households in the three villages of Geita district were allocated to either intervention (NNM filter system) or control (usual practice). The primary outcome of the trial is to reduce episodes of diarrhoea at 6 months post‐randomisation. Secondary outcomes are to improve water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) status. Although households were sampled, individuals living in the selected households are used as unit of analysis for estimation of prevalence and incidence of diarrhea. RESULTS: A total of 1,281 individuals (1,070 above 5 years and 211 under the age of 5 year children) lived in 186 households (7 individuals per household). The reported one‐week prevalence and incidence of diarrhea was 10.8% and 8.4% respectively. Children under the age of five years had high incidence (22.7%) of diarrhea than individuals aged 5 years and above (5.6%). Among under five children, boys had high incidence and prevalence of diarrhea than girls. Individuals with diarrhea were likely to live in poor household, not using safe water and toilet. Over 70% of households had unacceptable latrines 135 (72.7%) and poor water situation 138 (74.3%) in terms of practice of storing, treating and drawing water from storage container. Majority of respondents had limited knowledge on handwashing and rarely used soap when washing hands. CONCLUSION: Substantial proportion of individuals living in project areas are affected by diarrhea. Children below the age of five years are more affected than individuals aged five years and above. The baseline findings are representative of local status of WASH, and reflects the prevailing poor water, sanitation and hygiene status in rural areas of Tanzania.

There has been a robust discourse about the potential reasons for these underwhelming impacts, addressing issues of completeness, coverage, compliance, and baseline WASH/disease conditions, among others. However, an RCT, which evaluates a hypothesis in a specific context, cannot easily generalize to other contexts, so that counterfactual questions of “what would have happened if” are hard to address. Mechanistic models are a widely used to generalize findings between contexts but have not been previously applied to RCTs. The purpose of this study was to 1) develop a modeling framework to explain relative risk outcomes in an RCT and 2) to generalize the RCT results to other contexts and conditions. Our model accounts for i) transmission across multiple environmental pathways, ii) multiple interventions applied individually and in combination, iii) adherence to interventions, and iv) the impact of individuals not enrolled in the study. A Bayesian sampling approach was used to obtain posterior estimates of mechanistic parameters and their uncertainties for the WASH Benefits Bangladesh RCT (n=17,187), reproducing reported diarrheal prevalence. The baseline estimate of the basic reproduction number R0 for the control arm was 1.15, (95% CI: 1.09, 1.27) in the absence of intervention or preexisting WASH conditions. No single pathway‐water, fomites, or all other pathways‐was likely able to sustain transmission as pathway‐specific R0s were each below 1 (0.49 (95% CI: 0.07, 0.99), 0.26 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.57), and 0.40 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.88), respectively). In our counterfactual simulations, completeness and coverage, rather than compliance, efficacy, or baseline conditions, were most strongly associated with intervention effectiveness. Our approach can aid in understanding the contentious findings of the WASH‐Benefits trial but also enhance analysis of empirical RCT data for program decision‐making.",108,4,185,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 647428974,,,,Journal article; Conference proceeding,*Bangladesh; *disease transmission; Basic reproduction number; Conference abstract; Controlled study; Diarrhea; Drug therapy; Female; Fomite; Human; Lowest income group; Major clinical study; Prevalence; Randomized controlled trial; Risk factor; Sanitation; Simulation,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02875756/full,

Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) resulting from poor water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) may contribute. We therefore tested associations between EED and RVV immunogenicity, and evaluated the effect of improved WASH on EED. Methods: We measured nine biomarkers of EED among Zimbabwean infants born to mothers enrolled in a cluster‐randomised 2 × 2 factorial trial of improved WASH and improved feeding between November 2012 and March 2015 (NCT01824940). We used multivariable regression to determine associations between EED biomarkers and RVV seroconversion, seropositivity and geometric mean titer. Log‐binomial regression was used to evaluate the effect of improved WASH on EED. Findings: Among 303 infants with EED biomarkers and immunogenicity data, plasma intestinal fatty‐acid binding protein and stool myeloperoxidase were positively associated with RVV seroconversion; adjusted RR 1.63 (95%CI 1.04, 2.57) and 1.29 (95%CI 1.01, 1.65), respectively. There were no other associations between RVV immunogenicity and either individual biomarkers or EED domains (intestinal permeability, intestinal damage, intestinal inflammation and microbial translocation). EED biomarkers did not differ between randomised WASH and non‐WASH groups. Interpretation: We found no evidence that EED was associated with poor RVV immunogenicity.

Aims: To compare the efficacy of a 12‐strain mixture termed rectal bacteriotherapy with either FMT or vancomycin for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in an open‐label 3‐arm randomised controlled trial. Methods: We screened all individuals positive for C difficile from May 2017 to March 2019. Persons with laboratory‐confirmed recurrent CDI were included. Before FMT and rectal bacteriotherapy, we pre‐treated with vancomycin for 7‐14 days. Rectal bacteriotherapy was applied by enema on three consecutive days and FMT by enema once with possible repetition for two to three infusions within 14 days. The vancomycin group was treated for 14 days with additional five weeks of tapering for multiple recurrences. The primary outcome was clinical cure within 90 days. A secondary outcome was 180‐day all‐cause mortality. Results: Participants in the FMT group (n = 34) were cured more often than participants receiving vancomycin (n = 31), 76% vs 45% (OR 3.9 (1.4‐11.4), P < 0.01) or rectal bacteriotherapy (n = 31), 76% vs 52% (OR 3.0 (1.1‐8.8), P = 0.04). Rectal bacteriotherapy and vancomycin performed similarly (P = 0.61). The mortality rate was 6% in the FMT group, 13% in the bacteriotherapy group and 23% in the vancomycin group. FMT tended to reduce mortality compared with vancomycin, OR 0.2 (0.04‐1.12), P = 0.07. Conclusions: Rectal bacteriotherapy appears as effective as vancomycin but less effective than 1‐3 FMTs.

This randomized study was designed as a safety and feasibility study of long‐term FMT in subjects with mild to moderate UC using frozen, encapsulated oral FMT (cFMT). METHODS: Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive FMT induction by colonoscopy, followed by 12 weeks of daily oral administration of frozen encapsulated cFMT or sham therpay. Subjects were followed for 36 weeks and longitudenal clinical assessments included multiple subjective and objective markers of disease severity. Ribosomal 16S bacterial sequencing was used to assess donor‐induced changes in the gut microbiota. Changes in T regulatory (Treg) and mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cell populations were evaluated by flow cytometry as an exploratory endpoint. RESULTS: Twelve subjects with active UC were randomized: 6 subjects completed the full 12‐week course of FMT plus cFMT, and 6 subjects received sham treatment by colonic installation and longitudinal oral placebo capules. Chronic administration of cFMT was found to be safe and well‐tolerated but home storage concerns exist. Protocol adherence was high, and none of the study subjects experienced FMT‐associated treatment emergent adverse events. Two subjects that received cFMT achieved clinical remission versus none in the placebo group (95% CI = 0.38‐infinity, p = 0.45). cFMT was associated with sustained donor‐induced shifts in fecal microbial composition. Changes in MAIT cell cytokine production were observed in cFMT recipients and correlated with treatment response. CONCLUSION: These pilot data suggest that daily encapsulated cFMT may extend the durability of index FMT‐induced changes in gut bacterial community structure and that an association between MAIT cell cytokine production and clinical response to FMT may exist in UC populations. Oral frozen encapsulated cFMT is a promising FMT delivery system and may be preferred for longterm treatment strategies in UC and other chronic diseases but further evaluations will have to address home storage concerns. Larger trials should be done to explore the benefits of cFMT and to determine its long‐term impacts on the colonic microbiome. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02390726).

A high rye food intake has been associated with improved metabolic risk factors in some but not all observational and intervention studies. Whole‐grain rye has also been suggested to affect the gut microbiota in individuals with metabolic syndrome. However, it is yet unclear to what extent effects on the gut microbiota mediate the beneficial metabolic responses of whole‐grain rye intake. We hypothesized that a high intake of whole grain rye products containing fermented rye bran (FRB) vs. refined wheat based products (RW) could alter the gut microbiota and short‐chain fatty acid (SCFA) composition towards a phenotype associated with beneficial metabolic effects in a population not used to such foods. For this purpose, we conducted a post hoc analysis of a 12‐week randomized controlled trial in Chinese adults with Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, with 53 participants consuming RW and 31 participants consuming FRB included in the analysis. Anthropometric measurements and fasting blood and fecal sample analyses as well as 13C‐urea breath test were performed at baseline and after a 12‐week intervention. At week 12, we observed a higher serum insulin concentration (P‐value = 0.038) in the FRB group (n = 31) versus the RW group (n = 53), and this difference was corroborated with alterations in the genus‐level relative abundances of the gut microbiota, represented by an increase in Romboutsia and a reduction in Bilophila in the FRB group (n = 22) versus the RW group (n = 46). Compared to the RW group (n = 53), fecal acetic acid concentration was significantly higher in the FRB group (n = 31) at week 12. We also found that fecal acetic and butyric acids positively, while isobutyric, isovaleric and 2‐methylbutyric acids inversely, correlated with the gut Romboutsia level among all participants (n = 68) at week 12. We found positive correlations of fecal isobutyric, isovaleric and 2‐methylbutyric acids with gut Bilophila (n = 68). In conclusion, our results suggest that the intake of high‐fibre rye products could modify gut Romboutsia and Bilophila in a Chinese population with HP infection. These effects are paralleled with favorable modifications of the SCFA concentration and are associated with altered glycemic traits.",12,19,9141‐9150,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 34397057,EMBASE 635909305,,,,Journal article,"*Secale; *dietary fiber; *fermented product; *intestine flora; Adult; Aged; Blood; Blood Glucose [metabolism]; Chemistry; China; Controlled study; Dietary Fiber; Fatty Acids, Volatile [analysis, metabolism]; Feces; Feces [chemistry, microbiology]; Female; Fermentation; Fermented Foods; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Glucose blood level; Helicobacter Infections [metabolism, *microbiology]; Helicobacter infection; Helicobacter pylori; Human; Humans; Insulin [blood]; Male; Metabolism; Microbiology; Middle Aged; Middle aged; Randomized controlled trial; Secale; Triticum; Wheat; Young Adult; Young adult",10.1039/d1fo01423d,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02323903/full,

Limited studies have shown that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can reduce MDRO colonization, but its mechanisms are poorly understood. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of FMT for MDRO decolonization in renal transplant recipients called PREMIX (NCT02922816). Eleven participants were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to FMT or an observation period followed by delayed FMT if stool cultures were MDRO positive at day 36. Participants who were MDRO positive after one FMT were treated with a second FMT. At last visit, eight of nine patients who completed all treatments were MDRO culture negative.

Metagenomic analyses revealed a previously unobserved mechanism of MDRO eradication by conspecific strain competition in an FMT‐treated subset. Susceptible Enterobacterales strains that replaced baseline extended‐spectrum β‐lactamase‐producing strains were not detectable in donor microbiota manufactured as FMT doses but in one case were detectable in the recipient before FMT.

Previous studies in these patients have shown improvements in various microbiome indices after fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). However, whether microbiome improvements translate into improved clinical outcomes remains unclear. We examined this question in a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase II trial. METHODS: Two independent cohorts of allogeneic HCT recipients and patients with AML receiving induction chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive standardized oral encapsulated FMT versus placebo upon neutrophil recovery. After each course of antibacterial antibiotics, patients received a study treatment. Up to three treatments were administered within 3 months. The primary end point was 4‐month all‐cause infection rate. Patients were followed for 9 months. RESULTS: In the HCT cohort (74 patients), 4‐month infection density was 0.74 and 0.91 events per 100 patient‐days in FMT and placebo arms, respectively (infection rate ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.48 to 1.42; P = .49). In the AML cohort (26 patients), 4‐month infection density was 0.93 in the FMT arm and 1.25 in the placebo arm, with an infection rate ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.32 to 1.71; P = .48). Unique donor bacterial sequences comprised 25%‐30% of the fecal microbiota after FMT. FMT improved postantibiotic recovery of microbiota diversity, restored several depleted obligate anaerobic commensals, and reduced the abundance of expanded genera Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Dialister. CONCLUSION: In allogeneic HCT recipients and patients with AML, third‐party FMT was safe and ameliorated intestinal dysbiosis, but did not decrease infections.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is being explored as a therapeutic option. Little is known of the mechanisms of engraftment of microbes following FMT and whether the engraftment of certain microbes correlate with clinical improvement in IBS. Microbiome data, from a previously reported placebo‐controlled trial of treatment of IBS with FMT or placebo capsules, were used to investigate microbial engraftment 15 days, 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment through assessment of gains, losses and changes in abundance of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and microbial diversity (CHAO‐1 richness) between the FMT group and the placebo group. These data were compared to changes in IBS Symptom Severity Scores (IBS‐SSS). Twelve days of treatment with 25 daily multi‐donor FMT capsules induced significant short‐ and long‐term changes in the recipients’ microbiomes for at least 6 months, with persistent engraftment of a variety of anaerobic bacteria from keystone genera, such as Faecalibacterium, Prevotella and Bacteroides and increased microbial diversity, particularly in patients with low initial diversity. FMT recipients lost ASVs after treatment, which was seen to a much lesser extent in the placebo group. No ASVs increased to a greater extent between FMT responders and non‐responders following treatment.

There is emerging evidence that host engraftment of donor taxa is a tenet of successful FMT. We undertook a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled pilot study to characterize the response to FMT in children and young adults with mild to moderate active Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Subjects with CD or UC were randomized to receive antibiotics and weekly FMT or placebo in addition to baseline medications. We enrolled 15 subjects aged 14‐29 years. Four subjects had CD, and 11 had UC. Subjects exhibited a wide range of microbial diversity and donor engraftment. Specifically, engraftment ranged from 26 to 90% at week 2 and 3‐92% at 2 months. Consistent with the current literature, increases over time of both alpha diversity (p < 0.05) and donor engraftment (p < 0.05) correlated with improved clinical response. We discovered that the post‐antibiotic but pre‐FMT time point was rich in microbial correlates of eventual engraftment. Greater residual alpha diversity after antibiotic treatment was positively correlated with engraftment and subsequent clinical response.

Colonisation with MDRO precedes invasive infections, which can be challenging to treat with excess morbidity and mortality compared to antimicrobial‐susceptible infections. Currently, there are no effective GIT decolonisation strategies. Whilst faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has emerged as a potential therapeutic, there remains uncertainty about its feasibility, safety, and efficacy. METHODS: Population: Patients with invasive infection with extended‐spectrum beta‐lactamase (ESBL‐) or carbapenem‐resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and persistent GIT carriage. INTERVENTION: Three doses of encapsulated lyophilised FMT. COMPARATOR: Matched placebo capsules. OUTCOMES: Primary outcome was participant consent rate as a proportion of those approached to be screened for GIT carriage of ESBL‐E/CRE. Secondary outcomes were additional feasibility, safety and tolerability, and efficacy metrics. Exploratory outcomes included stool metagenomic analysis. RESULTS: Of 460 approached individuals, 124 (27%) consented. 53/124 participants (43%) fulfilled all eligibility criteria. 44/53 (83%) of those eligible were randomised and 41/44 (93%) received investigational medicinal product (IMP): 20 FMT and 21 placebo. 39/41 (95%) completed IMP dosing. Abdominal bloating and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were more common following FMT, but there were no unanticipated harms. MDRO carriage decreased over time across arms but was lower at all time points in the FMT arm. FMT increased microbiome diversity and microbiome‐based health measures. FMT recipients' samples clustered into two groups, with those with more dissimilar community composition to donors more likely to decolonise post‐FMT (3/5 vs. 0/12, p = 0.01). Patients that decolonised exhibited a trend towards increased proportional representation of donor‐derived strains in their post‐FMT samples (p = 0.05) and change in strain dominance within MDRO at the species‐level. CONCLUSIONS: Progression to a substantive trial is feasible with modifications to the existing FERARO protocol. FMT was safe, well tolerated, and acceptable to patients colonised with MDRO. Microbiome analysis infers that greater donor‐recipient microbiome dissimilarity at baseline and higher rates of donor‐derived strain engraftment favour MDRO decolonisation, which in turn maybe facilitated by conspecific strain replacement.",91,1,106504,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),PUBMED 40383397,,,,,Journal article,"*Carrier State [microbiology, therapy]; *Enterobacteriaceae Infections [microbiology, therapy]; *Fecal Microbiota Transplantation [adverse effects, methods]; *Gastrointestinal Tract [microbiology]; Adult; Aged; Anti‐Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Feasibility Studies; Feces [microbiology]; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome",10.1016/j.jinf.2025.106504,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02854197/full,

Functional bowel diseases are studied under five headings: functional constipation, functional diarrhea, functional abdominal bloating / tightness and unclassifiable functional bowel disorders. Functional constipation is divided into three categories as normal transition‐time constipation, slow transition‐time constipation and defecation disorders. Defecation disorders occur due to improper use of pelvic floor muscles and anorectal muscles or anatomical abnormalities and account for 1/3 of all constipation. Defecation disorders characterized by excessive straining, incomplete defecation sensation, difficult and painful defecation are defined as narrowing of the fecal exit path due to involuntary pelvic floor contractions or posterior compartment pelvic organ prolapse. Non‐pharmacological treatment in the treatment of functional constipation is considered as the first‐line treatment and includes information about the nutrition, fiber‐liquid consumption, physical activity and toilet training of patients. Biofeedback therapy is often recommended in patients with defecation disorders in the literature, and there are studies showing that it is superior to laxative use and placebo applications in the studies conducted. However, the fact that it is difficult and costly to achieve Biofeedback treatment, the method used allows movement at a certain angle and does not include the stretching method seems to be a disadvantage. Postisometric Relaxation technique is used in cases of pain, muscle spasm and movement limitations. People with defecation disorders experience spasms, pain and movement limitations in the pelvic floor muscles. For this reason, the investigators think that the Postisometric Relaxation technique may be effective in patients with defecation disorders, and it will also provide advantages due to the fact that the method is easily accessible, does not require extra materials and devices, and has a stretching effect. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Postisometric Relaxation technique on constipation severity, quality of life, anal pain, muscle function and sexual function in patients with defecation disorder.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT06215924,,,Trial registry record,Ataxia; Constipation; Pelvic Floor Disorders,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02679814/full,

In a randomized double‐blinded controlled multicentric clinical trial, healthy term infants received either infant formula (control) or the same formula with two HMOs (2'‐fucosyllactose and lacto‐N‐neotetraose; test) from enrollment (0 to 14 days) to 6 months. Then, all infants received the same follow‐up formula without HMOs until 12 months of age. Breastfed infants (BF) served as a reference group. Stool microbiota at 3 and 12 months, analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, clustered into seven fecal community types (FCTs) with marked differences in total microbial abundances. Three of the four 12‐month FCTs were likely precursors of the adult enterotypes. At 3 months, microbiota composition in the test group (n = 58) appeared closer to that of BF (n = 35) than control (n = 63) by microbiota alpha (within group) and beta (between groups) diversity analyses and distribution of FCTs. While bifidobacteriaceae dominated two FCTs, its abundance was significantly higher in one (FCT BiH for Bifidobacteriaceae at high abundance) than in the other (FCT Bi for Bifidobacteriaceae). HMO supplementation increased the number of infants with FCT BiH (predominant in BF) at the expense of FCT Bi (predominant in control). We explored the association of the FCTs with reported morbidities and medication use up to 12 months. Formula‐fed infants with FCT BiH at 3 months were significantly less likely to require antibiotics during the first year than those with FCT Bi. Previously reported lower rates of infection‐related medication use with HMOs may therefore be linked to gut microbiota community types. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT01715246.)IMPORTANCE Human milk is the sole and recommended nutrition for the newborn infant and contains one of the largest constituents of diverse oligosaccharides, dubbed human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). Preclinical and clinical association studies indicate that HMOs have multiple physiological functions largely mediated through the establishment of the gut microbiome. Until recently, HMOs were not available to investigate their role in randomized controlled intervention trials. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the effects of 2 HMOs on establishing microbiota in newborn infants. We provide a detailed description of the microbiota changes observed upon feeding a formula with 2 HMOs in comparison to breastfed reference infants' microbiota.

METHODS: In this double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, single‐center trial, 280 patients with PD were screened, and 72 eligible patients were block‐randomized (1:1) to receive either multistrain probiotics capsules (n = 34) or identical‐appearing placebo (n = 38), for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in the average number of spontaneous bowel movements (SBM) per week during the last 2 weeks of intervention compared with the 2‐week preintervention phase, recorded by daily stool diary. Secondary outcome measures included changes in stool consistency, constipation severity score, and quality of life related to constipation. Satisfaction with intervention received was assessed. Change in levels of fecal calprotectin, a marker of intestinal inflammation, was an exploratory outcome. RESULTS: SBM increased by 1.0 ± 1.2 per week after treatment with probiotics and decreased by 0.3 ± 1.0 per week in the placebo group (mean difference 1.3, 95% confidence interval 0.8‐1.8, p < 0.001).

We studied the effects of a low‐fat, high‐fiber diet (LFD) vs an improved standard American diet (iSAD, included higher quantities of fruits, vegetables, and fiber than a typical SAD). We collected data on quality of life, markers of inflammation, and fecal markers of intestinal dysbiosis in patients with UC. METHODS: We analyzed data from a parallel‐group, cross‐over study of 17 patients with UC in remission or with mild disease (with a flare within the past 18 mo), from February 25, 2015, through September 11, 2018. Participants were assigned randomly to 2 groups and received a LFD (10% of calories from fat) or an iSAD (35%‐40% of calories from fat) for the first 4‐week period, followed by a 2‐week washout period, and then switched to the other diet for 4 weeks. All diets were catered and delivered to patients' homes, and each participant served as her or his own control. Serum and stool samples were collected at baseline and week 4 of each diet and analyzed for markers of inflammation. We performed 16s ribosomal RNA sequencing and untargeted and targeted metabolomic analyses on stool samples. The primary outcome was quality of life, which was measured by the short inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) questionnaire at baseline and week 4 of the diets. Secondary outcomes included changes in the Short‐Form 36 health survey, partial Mayo score, markers of inflammation, microbiome and metabolome analysis, and adherence to the diet. RESULTS: Participants' baseline diets were unhealthier than either study diet. All patients remained in remission throughout the study period. Compared with baseline, the iSAD and LFD each increased quality of life, based on the short IBD questionnaire and Short‐Form 36 health survey scores (baseline short IBD questionnaire score, 4.98; iSAD, 5.55; LFD, 5.77; baseline vs iSAD, P = .02; baseline vs LFD, P = .001). Serum amyloid A decreased significantly from 7.99 mg/L at baseline to 4.50 mg/L after LFD (P = .02), but did not decrease significantly compared with iSAD (7.20 mg/L; iSAD vs LFD, P = .07). The serum level of C‐reactive protein decreased numerically from 3.23 mg/L at baseline to 2.51 mg/L after LFD (P = .07). The relative abundance of Actinobacteria in fecal samples decreased from 13.69% at baseline to 7.82% after LFD (P = .017), whereas the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes increased from 14.6% at baseline to 24.02% on LFD (P = .015). The relative abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was higher after 4 weeks on the LFD (7.20%) compared with iSAD (5.37%; P = .04). Fecal levels of acetate (an anti‐inflammatory metabolite) increased from a relative abundance of 40.37 at baseline to 42.52 on the iSAD and 53.98 on the LFD (baseline vs LFD, P = .05; iSAD vs LFD, P = .09). The fecal level of tryptophan decreased from a relative abundance of 1.33 at baseline to 1.08 on the iSAD (P = .43), but increased to a relative abundance of 2.27 on the LFD (baseline vs LFD, P = .04; iSAD vs LFD, P = .08); fecal levels of lauric acid decreased after LFD (baseline, 203.4; iSAD, 381.4; LFD, 29.91; baseline vs LFD, P = .04; iSAD vs LFD, P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: In a cross‐over study of patients with UC in remission, we found that a catered LFD or iSAD were each well tolerated and increased quality of life. However, the LFD decreased markers of inflammation and reduced intestinal dysbiosis in fecal samples. Dietary interventions therefore might benefit patients with UC in remission.

They consumed as a supplement 4.5 g of CG daily or maltodextrin as control. Before and after interventions, fasting and postprandial metabolic parameters and exhaled gases (hydrogen [H2] and methane [CH4]) were evaluated. Gut microbiota composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis), fecal concentrations of bile acids, long‐ and short‐chain fatty acids (LCFA, SCFA), zonulin, calprotectin and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) were analyzed.

Of note, the decrease in postprandial glycemia was only observed in subjects with higher exhaled H2, assessed upon lactulose breath test performed at inclusion. CG decreased a family belonging to Actinobacteria phylum and increased 3 bacterial taxa: Erysipelotrichaceae UCG.003, Ruminococcaceae UCG.005 and Eubacterium ventriosum group. Fecal metabolites, inflammatory and intestinal permeability markers did not differ between groups. In conclusion, we showed that CG supplementation modified the gut microbiota composition and improved postprandial glycemic response, an early determinant of cardiometabolic risk.

Intestinal microbiota may help identify patients at risk, thus improving the strategies of secondary prevention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the baseline differences between the gut microbiota from coronary heart disease (CHD) patients suffering new major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in the following 7 years, compared with CHD patients who did not undergo new MACE in this period, and to build a score associated with the risk of suffering new MACE. METHODS: Within the framework of the CORDIOPREV study, a clinical trial that involved 1002 patients with CHD, intestinal microbiota was examined in patients with available faecal samples (n = 679, 132 MACE), through 16S metagenomics on the Illumina MiSeq and Quiime2 software. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was measured using limulus amoebocyte lysate test. RESULTS: Random survival forest identified 10 bacterial taxa with a higher predictive power for MACE incidence. Receiver operating characteristic curves yielded an area under the curve of 65.2% (59.1%‐71.3%) in the training set and 68.6% (59.3%‐77.9%) in the validation set. The intestinal microbiota risk score was associated with a MACE incidence hazard ratio of 2.01 (95% confidence interval 1.37‐3.22).

Trimethylamine (TMA) is produced by gut bacteria from dietary choline, betaine, or L‐carnitine, and is then converted in the liver to Trimethylamine N‐oxide (TMAO), which in turn affects hepatic and intestinal lipid metabolism. Circulating TMAO is positively associated with CVD risk. Because eggs are rich in choline, it has been speculated that their consumption may increase plasma TMAO. In this study, we hypothesized that 2 eggs per day increases plasma TMAO level by altering gut microbiome composition in mildly hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women. In this randomized, cross‐over study, 20 overweight, postmenopausal women were given 2 whole eggs and the equivalent amount of yolk‐free substitute as breakfast for 4 weeks, in randomized order, with a 4‐week washout in between. Fasting blood draws and stool were collected at the beginning and end of each treatment period. Plasma TMAO, choline, betaine and other metabolites were analyzed using LC/MS, while gut microbiome composition was analyzed using 16S amplicon sequencing. Plasma choline and betaine were significantly increased after whole egg but not yolk‐free substitute, however TMAO level was not significantly affected by treatments. Gut microbiome composition showed large inter‐individual variability at baseline and in response to the treatments.

We investigated whether administration of a synbiotic combination of probiotic and prebiotic agents affected liver fat content, biomarkers of liver fibrosis, and the composition of the fecal microbiome in patients with NAFLD. METHODS: We performed a double‐blind phase 2 trial of 104 patients with NAFLD in the United Kingdom. Participants (mean age, 50.8 ± 12.6 years; 65% men; 37% with diabetes) were randomly assigned to groups given the synbiotic agents (fructo‐oligosaccharides, 4 g twice per day, plus Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis BB‐12; n = 55) or placebo (n = 49) for 10‐14 months. Liver fat content was measured at the start and end of the study by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and liver fibrosis was determined from a validated biomarker scoring system and vibration‐controlled transient elastography. Fecal samples were collected at the start and end of the study, the fecal microbiome were analyzed by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Mean baseline and end‐of‐study magnetic resonance spectroscopy liver fat percentage values were 32.3% ± 24.8% and 28.5% ± 20.1% in the synbiotic group and 31.3% ± 22% and 25.2% ± 17.2% in the placebo group. In the unadjusted intention‐to‐treat analysis, we found no significant difference in liver fat reduction between groups (β = 2.8; 95% confidence interval, ‐2.2 to 7.8; P = .30). In a fully adjusted regression model (adjusted for baseline measurement of the outcome plus age, sex, weight difference, and baseline weight), only weight loss was associated with a significant decrease in liver fat (β = 2; 95% confidence interval, 1.5‐2.6; P = .03). Fecal samples from patients who received the synbiotic had higher proportions of Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium species, and reductions in Oscillibacter and Alistipes species, compared with baseline; these changes were not observed in the placebo group. Changes in the composition of fecal microbiota were not associated with liver fat or markers of fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial of patients with NAFLD, 1 year of administration of a synbiotic combination (probiotic and prebiotic) altered the fecal microbiome but did not reduce liver fat content or markers of liver fibrosis.

OBJECTIVE: Explore characteristics of overweight and obese female early‐stage (0 to II) breast cancer patients with low AM relative abundance (LAM) vs high (HAM) enrolled in a presurgical weight‐loss trial. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of pooled participants in a randomized controlled trial (NCT02224807). PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: During the period from 2014 to 2017, 32 female patients with breast cancer were randomized to weight‐loss or attention‐control arms from time of diagnosis‐to‐lumpectomy (mean=30±9 days). INTERVENTION: All were instructed to correct nutrient deficiencies via food sources and on upper‐body exercises. The weight‐loss group received additional guidance to promote 0.5 to 1 kg/wk weight‐loss via energy restriction and aerobic exercise. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At baseline and follow‐up, sera, fecal samples, two‐24 hour dietary recalls and dual x‐ray absorptiometry were obtained. Bacterial DNA was isolated from feces and polymerase chain reaction (16S) amplified. Inflammatory cytokines were measured in sera. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Differences between LAM and HAM participants were analyzed using t tests and nonparametric tests. Spearman correlations explored relationships between continuous variables. RESULTS: Participants were aged 61±9 years with body mass index 34.8±6. Mean AM relative abundance was 0.02% (0.007% to 0.06%) and 1.59% (0.59% to 13.57%) for LAM and HAM participants, respectively. At baseline, women with HAM vs LAM had lower fat mass (38.9±11.2 kg vs 46.4±9.0 kg; P=0.044). Alpha diversity (ie, species richness) was higher in women with HAM (360.8±84.8 vs 282.4±69.6; P=0.008) at baseline, but attenuated after weight‐loss (P=0.058).

Plasma TMAO increases following consumption of red meat. This metabolic change is thought to be partly because of the expansion of gut microbes able to use nutrients abundant in red meat. Methods and Results We used data from a randomized crossover study to estimate the degree to which TMAO can be estimated from fecal microbial composition. Healthy participants received a series of 3 diets that differed in protein source (red meat, white meat, and non‐meat), and fecal, plasma, and urine samples were collected following 4 weeks of exposure to each diet. TMAO was quantitated in plasma and urine, while shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on fecal DNA. While the cai gene cluster was weakly correlated with plasma TMAO (rho=0.17, P=0.0007), elastic net models of TMAO were not improved by abundances of bacterial genes known to contribute to TMAO synthesis. A global analysis of all taxonomic groups, genes, and gene families found no meaningful predictors of TMAO. We postulated that abundances of known genes related to TMAO production do not predict bacterial metabolism, and we measured choline‐ and carnitine‐trimethylamine lyase activity during fecal culture. Trimethylamine lyase genes were only weakly correlated with the activity of the enzymes they encode. Conclusions Fecal microbiome composition does not predict systemic TMAO because, in this case, gene copy number does not predict bacterial metabolic activity.

We investigated the luminal microbiota before and longitudinally after surgery, in relation to disease recurrence, using 16S metagenomic techniques. Methods: In the prospective Post‐Operative Crohn’s Endoscopic Recurrence (POCER) study, fecal samples were obtained before surgery and 6, 12, and 18 months after surgery from 130 CD patients. Endoscopy was undertaken to detect disease recurrence, defined as Rutgeerts score ≥i2, at 6 months in two‐thirds of patients and all patients at 18 months after surgery. The V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Cluster analysis was performed at family level, assessing microbiome community differences between patients with and without recurrence. Results: Six microbial cluster groups were identified. The cluster associated with maintenance of remission was enriched for the Lachnospiraceae family [adjusted OR 0.47 (0.27–0.82), P = .007]. The OTU diversity of Lachnospiraceae within this cluster was significantly greater than in all other clusters. The cluster enriched for Enterobacteriaceae was associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence [adjusted OR 6.35 (1.24–32.44), P = .026]. OTU diversity of Enterobacteriaceae within this cluster was significantly greater than in other clusters. Conclusions: Luminal bacterial communities are associated with protection from, and the occurrence of, Crohn’s disease recurrence after surgery.

The aim of the present investigation was to study the effects of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum HEAL9 and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei 8700:2 on the single‐cell parasitome, with a primary focus on Blastocystis. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 78 Swedish children with celiac disease autoimmunity participating in a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trial to either receive a mixture of supplementation with L. plantarum HEAL9 and L. paracasei 8700:2 (n = 38) or placebo (n = 40). A total of 227 stool samples collected at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of intervention, respectively, were retrospectively analyzed for Blastocystis by quantitative real‐time PCR and subtyped by massively parallel amplicon sequencing. Other single‐cell parasites were detected by untargeted 18S rDNA amplicon sequencing and verified by real‐time PCR. The relation between the parasites and the bacteriome community was characterized by using 16S rDNA profiling of the V3‐V4 region. RESULTS: Three different single‐cell protists were identified, of which the highest prevalence was found for Dientamoeba fragilis (23.1%, 18/78 children), followed by Blastocystis (15.4%, 12/78) and Entamoeba spp. (2.6%, 2/78). The quantity of the protists was stable over time and not affected by probiotic intervention (P = 0.14 for Blastocystis, P = 0.10 for D. fragilis). The positivity of the protists was associated with increased bacteriome diversity (measured by multiple indices, P < 0.03). Bacterial composition was influenced by the presence of the protists: positivity of Blastocystis was inversely associated with Akkermansia (at the levels of the genus as well as its family, order, class and phylum); P < 0.002), Faecalibacterium (P = 0.003) and Romboutsia (P = 0.029); positivity of D. fragilis was inversely associated with families Enterobacteriaceae (P = 0.016) and Coriobacteriaceae (P = 0.022) and genera Flavonifractor (P < 0.001), Faecalibacterium (P = 0.009), Lachnoclostridium (P = 0.029), Ruminococcus (P < 0.001) and Granulicatella (P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of single‐cell protists is low in children with celiac disease autoimmunity.

The human gut microbiota is related to health and disease including hypertension. Alterations in gut microbiota composition can change the short‐chain fatty acid profile released by the bacteria and contribute to hypertension and metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if the composition of the gut microbiota is altered in women who develop late‐onset preeclampsia. In this study, we investigated the composition of the gut microbiota at 28 weeks gestation in women who developed late‐onset (>34 weeks gestation) preeclampsia (DPE) by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of fecal samples obtained from 213 pregnant women in the SPRING cohort (Study of Probiotics IN Gestational diabetes). Quantitative real‐time PCR was used to assess the density of butyrate‐producing genes. Gut microbiota composition was compared between women with and without DPE. The abundance of the butyrate‐producing Coprococcus genus significantly decreased in DPE. Abundance of Coprococcus is significantly and positively correlated with the abundance of genes encoding the terminal step in bacterial butyrate formation (but and buk). Women with DPE also had significantly reduced levels of serum butyrate prior to the development of symptoms than controls.

BBD symptoms are thought to represent 40% of pediatric urology consultations. In children who do not have any neurological or physiological problems, micturition and defecation occur with the coordinated work of the involuntary bladder and bowel, voluntary contracting external urethral sphincter and external anorectal sphincter. For normal micturition and defecation, the pelvic floor muscles must be able to relax properly. This relaxation may not be achieved even in children with no neurological or physiological problems. Urotherapy and pharmacological treatments are used in conservative BBD treatment. Urotherapy includes education of the child and family, diet (adequate fiber and fluid consumption), regular optimal voiding, daily physical activity, teaching normal toilet use, pelvic floor muscle training and relaxation. Pilates is an exercise method that includes a series of movements that both strengthen and increase flexibility of the entire body without focusing on a specific muscle. It includes exercises that can work the pelvic floor muscles (PFMs), while avoiding intense abdominal contractions, holding breath, or straining that can create increased pressure on the pelvic floor. Reformer pilates is a specific type that provides resistance exercise at certain weights with the pulley system relying basically on the same principles. Pilates exercises provide breathing and activation of the deep stabilizing muscles of the trunk in coordination with the PFMs. It includes exercises that focus on pelvic stability, mobility and body alignment. PFMs activation is carried out simultaneously with the trunk muscles in various positions in coordination with breathing. Such exercises are known to have an important role related to continence, maintenance of intra‐abdominal pressure and respiratory mechanics. Despite the increasing number of health care professionals using the pilates‐based approach in rehabilitation. The pilates‐based exercises in rehabilitation is still insufficient in the literature.

The prevalence of infection with H. pylori infection varies worldwide. Pharmacologic therapy for eradication must be initiated in symptomatic individuals with emphasis on hygiene and sanitation. The high prevalence of H. pylori infection in the country, and the lack of adequate evidence on the efficacy of the standard triple therapy in Southern India was the drive to conduct this study. Aim: To compare and evaluate the efficacy of 14 days clarithromycin based triple drug therapy over 10 days levofloxacin based triple drug therapy in H. pylori eradication. Materials and Methods: A randomised clinical study was conducted from September 2018 to February 2019, at a tertiary care teaching hospital and research centre in suburban Chennai, Southern India. Eighty patients with dyspepsia, who were diagnosed with H. pylori infection based on both Rapid Urease Test (RUT) and histopathology of antral biopsy, were alternately assigned to treatment with either 14 days clarithromycin based triple drug regimen (PAC) or 10 days levofloxacin based triple drug regimen (PAL). Efficacy of the drugs were compared using both RUT and histopathology of endoscopic antral biopsy specimen four weeks after completion of the treatment. Chi‐square test was used for data analysis. Results: Out of the 80 enrolled patients, 70 individuals completed the study, of which 41 were males and 29 were females. Baseline characteristics were similar in the both the groups‐mean age 42.31±14.8 years in PAC and 42.20±12.67 years in PAL (p=0.150); 65.7% were males and 34.3% were females in PAC group, 51.4% were males and 48.6% were females in PAL group (p=0.225). Clearance of infection was seen in 23 patients (65.7%) in PAL group as compared to 32 patients (91.4%) in the PAC (p=0.01). Among patients with failure of eradication, 3 (1.05%) from PAC group and 12 (4.20%) from PAL group had persistence of dyspeptic symptoms. In addition, 7.14% (5 out of 70‐two from PAC and three from PAL group) of subjects who had H. pylori eradication had persistence of same symptoms of dyspepsia on follow‐up at four weeks after completion of the regimen.

Frequently, interventions do not consider behaviours or transmission pathways specific to age. A household playspace (HPS) is one intervention component which may block faecal‐oral transmission. This study was a two‐armed, parallel‐group, randomised, controlled feasibility trial of a HPS in rural Ethiopia. It aimed to recommend proceeding to a definitive trial. Secondary outcomes included effects on infant health, injury prevention and women's time. METHODS: November 2019‐January 2020 106 households were identified and assessed for eligibility. Recruited households (N = 100) were randomised (blinded prior to the trial start) to intervention or control (both n = 50). Outcomes included recruitment, attrition, adherence, and acceptability. Data were collected at baseline, two and four weeks. FINDINGS: Recruitment met a priori criteria (≥80%). There was no loss to follow‐up, and no non‐use, meeting adherence criteria (both ≤10%). Further, 48.0% (95% CI 33.7‐62.6; n = 24) of households appropriately used and 56.0% (41.3‐70.0; n = 28) cleaned the HPS over four weeks, partly meeting adherence criteria (≥50%). For acceptability, 41.0% (31.3‐51.3; n = 41) of infants were in the HPS during random visits, failing criteria (≥50%). Further, the proportion of HPS use decreased during some activities, failing criteria (no decrease in use). A modified Barrier Analysis described good acceptability and multiple secondary benefits, including on women's time burden and infant injury prevention. INTERPRETATION: Despite failing some a priori criteria, the trial demonstrated mixed adherence and good acceptability among intervention households. A definitive trial to determine efficacy is warranted if recommended adjustments are made. FUNDING: People In Need; Czech Development Agency.

Methods: This preliminary report of prospective study compared upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with white light and image‐enhanced endoscopy (IEE) in Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand between January 2020 and October 2020. All participants were randomized to perform gastroscopy with WLI, or IEE (NBI, LCI and BLI technique). Three biopsies at antrum and 2 biopsies at body are taken for H. pylori diagnosis (rapid urease test, H. pylori culture, and histopathology). H. pylori infection was defined as: positive H. pylori culture, or two positive tests (rapid urease test and histology). Results: 76 dyspeptic patients underwent gastroscopy, and 21 patients were enrolled in this study. Overall H. pylori infection was 57.1% and patients mean age was 59.9 years (57.1% males and 42.9% females).

CN-02323062,"Gon, G",Ewash-a multi-period cross-over trial comparing hypochlorous acid and bleach on hospital surfaces,Antimicrobial resistance and infection control,2021,"Introduction: Environmental hygiene is crucia for preventing hospital associated infections. Cleaning practices in low‐income hospitals continue to rely on sodium hypochlorite, which is corrosive, requires accurate dilution on a daily basis and is toxic if in contact with skin or mucous membranes. Neutral Electrolyzed Water (EW) is an innovative surface disinfectant produced by passing an electrical current through saline water, whose active ingredient is hypochlorous acid. EW is neither toxic nor corrosive and it presents no environmental hazard, as it slowly reverts to saline during the period of chemical relaxation. The proven broad‐spectrum antimicrobial activity of EW enables high‐level surface disinfection. Surprisingly, the use of EW is currently largely unknown in the health sector. Objectives: The main objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Electrolyzed Water for disinfection of near‐patient hospital surfaces as compared to standard disinfection. Methods: A multi‐period cluster randomised trial (EWASH trial) will be used to evaluate the efficacy of EW for surface disinfection compared to standard disinfectant (chlorine‐based bleach) in three hospitals in Abuja, Nigeria, over six weeks. Four wards will be selected in each hospital and will be randomly allocated to one of the two interventioncontrol sequences. Each week either EW or the standard disinfectant is provided to these wards for surface cleaning. Microbiological cleanliness will be measured using double sided dipslides with non‐selective agar for Aerobic Colony Count (< 2.5 cfu/ cm2 = clean; ≥ 2.5 cfu/cm2 = not clean). The presence of S.aureus will be a secondary outcome. The study design is expected to have 87% power to demonstrate non‐inferiority at a 5% margin with 15 sampling sites in each ward (cohort structure) and a baseline of cleanliness ranging from 30 to 50%. Focus group discussions (FGDs) will be conducted with the cleaners to understand their perception of the product, barriers and enablers. Results: The trial is under way and data completion is planned for July 2021. Conclusion: EW has never been tested in low‐resource settings, the EWASH study will contribute to provide evidence on its efficacy for environmental hygiene. The study could provide evidence for further applications of EW in hospital settings such as cleaning medical equipment, use for burns wounds and diabetic foot infections.",10,SUPPL 1,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 636025701,,,,Journal article; Conference proceeding,Adult; Antimicrobial activity; Burn; Cleaning; Clinical trial; Comparative effectiveness; Conference abstract; Controlled study; Corrosion; Diabetic foot; Disinfection; Drug efficacy; Drug therapy; Electrolysis; Environmental sanitation; Female; Human; Leisure; Male; Medical device; Multicenter study; Nigeria; Nonhuman; Outcome assessment; Perception; Randomized controlled trial; Staphylococcus aureus,10.1186/s13756-021-00974-z0,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02323062/full,

Participants will be allocated into two groups: intervention group (GI) ‐ performed the intervention of physical therapy functional embracement; control group (CG) ‐ the physiotherapeutic functional reception intervention will not be performed. Randomization will occur in chronological order of amputation, interspersing 5 individuals for each group (starting with the CG) until reaching a total of 50 participants for each group. Data collection in the electronic medical record will begin in the immediate postoperative period of distal lower extremity amputation, in both groups. At this moment, sociodemographic and clinical information regarding the amputation will be collected, through the consent consented through the Letter of Authorization from the Guardian of the Records (Anne XB). Then, to the IG, still in the immediate postoperative period, the patient will be approached at the bedside, where the reading and request for signature of the Free and Informed Consent Term ‐ TCLE will be performed (Appendi XC). If there is consent, the intervention will be carried out, through functional physiotherapeutic reception, which will be carried out by the research physiotherapist, at the time of the immediate postoperative period (first 24 hours) of the lower extremity amputation, only once, with a stipulated time of 50 minutes. The intervention performed, for all participants, will be performed by the same researcher. Thus, as previously described, sociodemographic and clinical data from the patient's medical record will be initially collected. Subsequently, the initial contact will be made through the Semi‐structured Reception Questionnaire th SP2.157.108 CONDITION: Amputation; Peripheral Vascular Diseases C14.907 PRIMARY OUTCOME: Presentation of the expected outcome functional status through the application of the modified barthel index. Based on the modified barthel index, it is possible to assess activities of daily living, divided into ten categories: food; bathing, clothing, personal hygiene, intestinal eliminations, bladder eliminations, use of the toilet, chair‐bed transfer, ambulation and stairs. For each item there are five response options, 1. dependent; 2. full assistance; 3. partial assistance; 4. minimal assistance; 5. independence. The classification is performed by scores that in the sum can vary from 0 to 100. The interpretation of the result is done through the cut‐off points, as follows: 100 points ‐ totally independent; 99 to 76 points ‐ mild dependence; 75 to 51 points ‐ moderate dependence; 50 to 26 points ‐ severe dependence; 25 or less points ‐ total dependence; values ??less than or equal to 20 points ‐ increased probability of mortality.

Materials and methods: A retrospective randomized clinical study in the Otorhinolaryngology Department at a Tertiary care hospital with sixty‐seven immunocompetent patients presenting with complaints of ear itching, ear blockage, and thick ear discharge. After a general examination followed by an otoscopic examination, a sample was taken from the affected ear over sterile cotton swabs and sent for fungal stain and culture. Results: Equal incidence was observed among all age‐groups and both genders. The most common presentation was predominantly unilateral ear itching (20 patients: 30%) and itching associated with unilateral ear blockage (17 patients: 25%). The most common otoscopic finding was black spores in the External Auditory Canal (EAC) (50 patients: 75%) followed by thick dirty white discharge in EAC (17 patients: 25%). The most common incriminating fungus was Aspergillus niger (35 patients: 52%) followed by Aspergillus flavus (25 patients: 37%). The cure rate with aural toilet on presentation and Clotrimazole (1%) topical ear drops for seven days in the affected ear is 100%. Conclusion: Otomycosis is an endemic disease in hot and humid regions, affecting the masses including the immunocompetent. However, it resolves by topical clotrimazole without any sequelae and has an excellent prognosis in immunocompetent.

CN-02587815,"NCT05970133,",Robotic Versus Laparoscopy NOSE for Stage I-III Left-sided Colon Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05970133,2023,"Over the past three decades, laparoscopic surgery has evolved incessantly, especially inthe field of colorectal surgery. It has been widely accepted by surgeons and patients inlight of the better peri‐operative outcomes and analogical long‐term effectiveness,compared with open surgery for colorectal cancers. However, current conventionallaparoscopic colorectal surgery requires an additional abdominal incision for specimenretrieval and sometimes for intestinal reconstruction, which increases the risk ofvarious postoperative complications, including pain, surgical site infection, incisionalhernia, and injury to the epigastric artery and abdominal cutaneous nerves, and,consequently, can delay postoperative chemotherapy.To mitigate these unfavorable outcomes, natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) viathe anus, stomach, or vagina, was introduced. One randomized trial reported bettershort‐term surgical outcomes, including reduced pain and lower analgesia requirements forlaparoscopic NOSE colectomy, compared with conventional laparoscopic colectomy. Transanalspecimen extraction has been utilized after laparoscopic colon or rectal cancer surgeryand has been found to be feasible, safe, and oncologically sound in selected cases.Several multiport laparoscopic platforms are currently available to complete all NOSEprocedures and reestablish intestinal continuity with a single stapled anastomosis, whichhas been shown to improve short‐term results compared with conventional laparoscopiccolectomy. However, concerns remain regarding the long‐term oncologic safety (tumor cellspillage with local recurrence and long‐term survival) when NOSE is used for colorectalmalignancy.A barrier to wider adoption of NOSE is technical difficulty. The mini‐laparotomy, in somecases, is used to perform a majority of the operation, as in hand‐assisted laparoscopy.Adoption of NOSE by surgeons who typically perform colectomies in this fashion would befaced with a steeper learning curve than surgeons who use the mini‐laparotomy solely as aspecimen extraction site. On that note, intracorporeal anastomosis is a prerequisiteskill for those adopting NOSE. Removal of more proximal specimens, as in a rightcolectomy, requires the presence of a skilled endoscopist who can snare and pull thespecimen endoluminally through the length of the distal gastrointestinal tract. Specimenextraction via the vagina requires a posterior colpotomy, an operative maneuver that isnot typically performed by general or colorectal surgeons. Furthermore, these technicalchallenges are amplified by a lack of standardization of the technique.The demands for these technical skills are more important in removing right‐sided colonpathology, as compared to left‐sided pathology. There are inherent anatomic factors thatmake NOSE for right‐sided colon pathology more difficult. Right colectomy specimensextracted through the lower gastrointestinal tract via distal colotomy must travel thelength of the remaining transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon, through the rectum andout of the anus using an endoscope. While this was demonstrated to be feasible in 2010 byEshuis et al, it is inherently difficult due to the anatomically narrow and torturoussigmoid colon. In that series, extraction via colotomy failed in 2 of 10 patients due tothe bulk of the specimen. This technique is still performed in some centers, thoughlimitations related to the size of the specimen are stricter than for left‐sided colonlesions. This approach has little practicality due to its significant technicalchallenges, hence its limited use.Bacterial contamination is always a concern during the NOSE procedure. Most researchersstrongly suggest that mechanical bowel preparation, intraoperative transanal lavage withpovidone iodine solution, transluminal wound protector, and prophylactic antibiotics areapplied to reduce the bacterial load. Recently, a study showed that the risk of bacterialcontamination with NOSE was not significantly higher than that in conventionallaparoscopic surgery. In some studies, patients who had NOSE did not experiencesignificant postoperative morbidity or laboratory data changes, such as leukocytosis, CRPlevel elevation, rectal wound‐related complications or leakage, than the conventionalgroup.Tumor size is considered before applying the NOSE procedure. Many authors limitindications to tumors smaller than 3 ‐ 6.5 cm. Some authors have stated that obesepatients are not suitable for transrectal specimen extraction and set the BMI cutoff at >28‐35 kg/m2. Most researchers considered patients with a bulky mesocolon, a narrowpelvis, and previous pelvic surgery with severe adhesions were not eligible for NOSE.It is generally accepted that laparoscopic NOSE can achieve oncological and surgicalsafety comparable to that of conventional laparoscopic surgery for patients with sigmoidand rectal cancer. Remarkably, Laparoscopic NOSE patients were associated with a shorterhospital stay, shorter time to first flatus or defecation, less postoperative pain, andfewer surgical site infections and total perioperative complications. In general, theoperative time in laparoscopic NOSE was longer than that in conventional laparoscopicsurgery. The long‐term oncological efficacy of laparoscopic NOSE seems to be equivalentto that of conventional laparoscopic surgery. Furthermore, specimen retrieval throughalternative routes to avoid an abdominal incision is beneficial for the prevention ofincisional hernia.Currently, robotic surgical approaches are becoming more popular for treating colorectalcancer. Robotic techniques can overcome some technical limitations of laparoscopicsurgery, including an unstable camera view and straight laparoscopic instruments. Roboticsurgery is advantageous because it provides surgeon‐control of the camera,high‐definition three‐dimensional vision, excellent ergonomics, decreased physiologicaltremor, more freedom of angles of instruments, and the ability to simultaneously controlthe camera and two additional instruments that facilitate traction and countertraction,all of which enable to facilitate the procedures, even in difficult settings.The unique advantages of the surgical robot make colorectal surgery operations moreprecise and intelligent, providing more options for minimizing operative stress duringcolorectal surgery. The proximity between the sigmoid colon and rectum to the anallocation provides a favorable predisposition for transanal specimen retrieval withoutsignificantly increasing the difficulty of the surgical operation. However, to date, onlyvery few studies compared robotic NOSE versus laparoscopic NOSE for the surgery ofcolorectal cancer. Actually, our preliminary data has shown the safety and feasibility ofrobotic NOSE, as compared with laparoscopic NOSE for the surgery of colorectal cancer.Even to date, laparoscopic NOSE procedure for colorectal cancer is still not popular dueto the technique difficulty associated with an intra‐corporeal anastomosis for NOSE andthe oncologic concern of tumor spillage at the staple line during tumor retrievalprocess. In this respect, the introduction of robotic system can overcome the technicaldifficulties.In this project, the investigator aims to provide the level 1 evidence for the comparisonof robotic versus laparoscopic NOSE for the surgery of stage I‐III colorectal cancer. theinvestigator hypothesize that, with the increased maneuverability of the current roboticsystem, robotic surgery will be a good option for patients with stage I‐III colorectalcancer requiring a NOSE procedure.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT05970133,,,Trial registry record,Colorectal Neoplasms,,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02587815/full,

A feature of bacteriophages istheir high specificity, which at the same time may be a limitation for their widespreaduse in the absence of knowledge about bacterial sensitivity. The above‐mentioned suggeststhe possibility of using a cocktail of bacteriophages selected taking into account theexpected spectrum of pathogens and their sensitivity. A similar strategy was firstdeveloped by Zurabov F. (2021), who proposed adaptive phagotherapy for the prevention ofrecurrent nosocomial pneumonia, the specificity of which was the selection ofbacteriophages not for an individual patient, but for the entire spectrum of bacteriacirculating in the intensive care unit with continuous clinical and microbiologicalstudies with monitoring of efficacy. Based on the collection of hospital bacteria of 66antibiotic‐resistant strains, a complex preparation of bacteriophages for inhalationadministration was developed. The study included 83 patients in chronic criticalcondition with recurrent pneumonia in whom high safety and efficacy of the new approachwere convincingly demonstrated. The undeniable advantage of phagotherapy is its targetedeffect on pathogenic bacteria without affecting the microbiota, and therefore the absenceof such side effects as mucous membrane candidiasis, antibiotic‐associated diarrhoea,pseudomembranous colitis, etc. A number of studies have demonstrated the absence of anyside effects, which is probably due to the fact that bacteriophages are naturalinhabitants of the environment in harmony with humans. A number of studies havedemonstrated the absence of any side effects, which is probably due to the fact thatbacteriophages are natural inhabitants of the environment, harmoniously co‐existing withhumans. A separate advantage of phage therapy is the ability of several types of phagesto affect the same bacterial strains, which minimises the risk of developing resistanceto bacteriophages.The success of phagotherapy in patients with IE has been demonstrated in only a smallnumber of experimental and clinical studies. The treatment with BF does not yet have astrong evidence base from randomised clinical trials, but the available clinical datafrom a variety of pathologies (skin, soft tissue and joint infections, implantedintracardiac devices), suggest that phage therapy may be an effective adjunct toconventional antibiotic therapy or even as a stand‐alone treatment.Since currently the most common pathogens of IE are staphylococci, in particular S.aureus, the largest number of studies on the use of BF has been noted in this etiologicalaffiliation of IE. As S. aureus‐induced IE is more often associated with an unfavourablecourse, this is what prompted the search for new approaches to therapy, and the firststudies on the use of BF represented a salvage therapy, especially in the context ofmultidrug resistance. In general, no more than 10 modern experimental and clinicalstudies on the possibility of using bacteriophages in staphylococcal IE are presented,including 3 separate clinical observations and one description of a series of 13 cases ofIE. In an experimental rat model of S. aureus MSSA IE showed high efficacy of combinedtherapy with flucloxacillin with phage cocktail (intravenous form) with respect tovegetation sterility in 9/12 rats. Similar success was obtained in the experiment of IEcaused by S. aureus MRSA when treated with a combination of bacteriophages withvancomycin. This type of pathogen is characterised by a high incidence of antibioticresistance, which makes the use of BF in this group of patients particularly useful. In2019 was one of the first to present a clinical observation of a 65‐year‐old patient withnon‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy and IE of intracardiac device, uncontrolled courseof infection against the background of repeated change of antibiotic therapy. The use ofintravenous anti‐staphylococcal cocktail AB‐SA01 for 28 days 2 times a day in combinationwith antibiotic therapy allowed to achieve complete control of infection with subsequentheart transplantation [30]. In 2019 was demonstrated a similar observation of successfulapplication of intravenous anti‐staphylococcal cocktail AB‐SA01 for 14 days twice a dayin a patient with IE of S. aureus prosthetic valve and ineffectiveness of antibiotictherapy. Combined treatment with BF allowed to achieve complete recovery of the patient.The efficacy and safety of intravenous anti‐staphylococcal cocktail AB‐SA01 for 14 daystwice a day in 13 patients with severe S.aureus infections, including IE. The researchersdid not note any side effects, but the conclusion on the efficacy of therapy requiredfurther studies.Pneumococcal bacteriophage Cpl‐1 was investigated in an experiment on rats with IE causedby Str. pneumoniae, demonstrating rapid blood sanitation and reduction of pathogenconcentration in vegetations. Also, researchers investigated the efficacy of phagetherapy in IE caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in an experiment. The combination of BFand ciprofloxacin caused rapid sanitation of vegetations.Among the dangerous and difficult to treat pathogens of IE, it is necessary to highlightthe representatives of enterococci ‐ Ent. faecalis and Ent. faecium, characterised by theability to develop multidrug resistance, which has increased markedly over the last 10years. According to some data, the incidence of enterococci in fatal IE can reach 97%. Adistinctive feature of enterococci is their ability to form biofilms, which significantlycomplicates the therapy of IE. BF has a unique ability to destroy biofilms based on thelayer‐by‐layer penetration of BF into deeper layers of vegetation. In an experimentproved that BFs are able to penetrate vegetations, including in IE caused by E. faecalis.There have been no clinical studies on the efficacy of BF in enterococcal IE. In anexperiment on modelling vegetations from human blood ex vivo, another study showed thepossibility of synergy of BF with antibacterial drugs (daptomycin, ceftraroline),including the restoration of sensitivity of enterococci to antibacterial drugs.Thus, the treatment of IE, even with a known etiology, is a global challenge. Consideringthe fact that IE is often found among comorbid, elderly and debilitated patients, withhigh cardiac surgery perioperative risk, as well as the high frequency of IE withunidentified etiology not because of association with hard‐to‐cultivate pathogens, butbecause of low concentration of typical pathogen in blood due to previous antibiotictherapy, prolonged effective antibiotic therapy is often the only safe solution in suchcases. Taking into account the limited spectrum of effective antibacterial drugs, it isextremely important to study the efficacy and safety of phagotherapy in combination withantibacterial drugs in IE. The most optimal is the study of phagotherapy in the form ofphage cocktail to the most common typical pathogens of IE with application at the initialstages of treatment as part of empirical antibacterial therapy. It is assumed that suchan early start of effective treatment will avoid the development of resistance toantibacterial drugs and lead to rapid relief of IE activity with subsequent transfer ofpatients to outpatient treatment regimes. The advantage of the presented treatmentalgorithm is the possibility to cover all patients with IE before the etiologicalaffiliation is established, which will make it possible to obtain the treatment effectalready at the early stages of therapy.",,,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,,CTgov NCT06870409,,,Trial registry record,"Endocarditis; Endocarditis, Bacterial",,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02823157/full,

Preventing nasal canal colonization through an effective nasal cavity care, along with oral care seem to be an important issue. Methods: This single‐blind randomized controlled trial was conducted on 31 patients in each intervention and control group in Alzahra and Kashani hospitals, Iran. The interventional program was considered every 8 h for 5 days. It included cleaning the nasal cavities with cotton swabs soaked in sterile normal saline, then 2 puffs of 65% sodium chloride nasal spray were used for each nostril, and finally the nasal canal was moistened with a swab dipped in Veramin gel (0.5 ml into each nostril). For the control group, routine nasal care including cleaning the outer nostrils was offered. Oral care in 2 groups was performed according to the standard protocol. Data collected through demographic and clinical questionnaire as well as modified pulmonary infection clinical scale. The chi‐square and independent tests were used to determine the homogeneity of basic characteristics. Also, we estimated and compared the incidence of VAP between 2 groups by chi‐square test. Results: The incidence of VAP was not statistically different in the intervention and control groups on the third day after intervention (29.1% vs. 32.3%, respectively, P = .915), while this rate on the sixth day was significantly lesser in the intervention than control (32.3 vs. 58%, P = .041). Conclusion: The present nasal care program along with oral care is an effective strategy to prevent VAP.",7,1,,Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),,EMBASE 2027966540,,,,Journal article,*artificial ventilation; *intensive care unit; *mouth hygiene; *nose cavity; *ventilator associated pneumonia /complication /etiology /prevention; APACHE; Adult; Aloe vera; Article; Bacterial colonization; Cancer chemotherapy; Cleaning; Controlled study; Coughing; Critically ill patient; Deep vein thrombosis /prevention; Demography; Female; Hand washing; Head position; Hospital infection /etiology /prevention; Hospital patient; Human; Incidence; Iran; Leukocyte count; Major clinical study; Male; Mentha piperita; Mucus; Oral mucositis /drug therapy /prevention; Peptic ulcer /prevention; Questionnaire; Randomized controlled trial; Sedation; Single blind procedure; Stomach distension /prevention; Swallowing; Thorax radiography; Tooth plaque /drug therapy /prevention; Tracheobronchial toilet; Ventilated patient; Xerostomia /drug therapy /prevention,10.1016/j.mcpsp.2023.100401,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02618232/full,
