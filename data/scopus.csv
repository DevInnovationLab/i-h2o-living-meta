Their fecal contamination alters natural physicochemical stream characteristics and increases concentrations of fecal bacteria. Providing one of the first-large scale assessments of their impacts, our study identified wild pigs as a source of non-point pollution on both a regional and multi-regional scale within our selected study state through microbial source tracking and traditional water quality assessment. At a multi-regional scale, we found greater median concentrations (mg/L) of nitrate (95.7%; p < 0.001), magnesium (83.3%; p < 0.001), and potassium (84.7%; p < 0.001) in samples from streams with fecal contamination by wild pigs (n = 111) than from streams without (n = 115). Like other non-point pollutants, the effects of wild pigs on water quality are scale-dependent and differ significantly across regions. Finally, at both a regional and multi-regional scale, our study found observably greater Escherichia coli and fecal coliform concentrations in streams with wild pigs, though statistical significance was lost at scale. Future research will be necessary to continue to evaluate the impacts of wild pigs on water quality, especially across different scales. Our findings support continued monitoring of impacts as the density and range of North American wild pig populations continue to increase.","Fresh Water; Animal; Chemistry; Environmental Monitoring; Escherichia Coli; Feces; Introduced Species; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Pig; River; Water Quality; Wild Animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Fresh Water; Introduced Species; Rivers; Sus Scrofa; Swine; Water Microbiology; Water Quality","fresh water; animal; chemistry; environmental monitoring; Escherichia coli; feces; introduced species; isolation and purification; microbiology; pig; river; water quality; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Fresh Water; Introduced Species; Rivers; Sus scrofa; Swine; Water Microbiology; Water Quality",,Nature Research,20452322,,,40447705,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006932637

Contaminated drinking water remains a major public health concern, contributing to outbreaks of diarrheal and other infectious diseases. This study assesses the bacteriological quality of drinking water from sources to the point of use and identifies associated factors influencing contamination in Alemwach Refugee Camp, Dabat District, Northwest Ethiopia. A laboratory-supported cross-sectional study was conducted among Alemwach refugees by collecting a total of 435 drinking water samples (10 samples from the reservoir, 2 samples from the public stand well, 1 sample from the deep well, and 422 samples from household storage containers) for bacteriological analysis. Additionally, data were collected from 422 respondents using structured interviewer-based questionnaires and through observation that assessed factors related to the bacteriological quality of drinking water. Binary and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to find associated factors, and variables with a p-value of 0.05 were considered statistically significant variables. This study revealed that 33.3% of water samples from groundwater, 30% of water samples from reservoirs, and 78.9% of water samples from household storage drinking water were contaminated by fecal coliform. The sanitary risk score indicates a high-level risk score of 66.7% for groundwater sources and a 54.5% risk score for household storage containers, representing a medium risk score. Educational status, home-based water treatment practice, type of water storage container, cleanliness of water storage container, types of sanitation facility, and animal contact with households were significantly associated with bacteriological quality of drinking water quality at the point of use. This study reveals substantial fecal coliform contamination in drinking water, particularly at the household level, indicating a high risk of waterborne diseases in Alemwach Refugee Camp. The contamination is influenced by multiple factors, including household education, type of water storage container, type of sanitation facilities, home-based water treatment, animal contact, and container cleanliness. To improve drinking water quality, targeted interventions such as promoting safe water storage, enhancing household water treatment practices, improving sanitation infrastructure, and conducting community education programs on hygiene and water safety are recommended. Regular monitoring and risk assessment of water sources should also be strengthened to ensure sustainable access to safe drinking water.",Associated Factors; Bacteriological Water Quality; Fecal Coliform; Refugees Camp; Safe Water; Drinking Water; Drinking Water; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-sectional Study; Ethiopia; Female; Human; Male; Microbiology; Middle Aged; Refugee; Refugee Camp; Sanitation; Water Quality; Water Supply; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-sectional Studies; Drinking Water; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Refugee Camps; Refugees; Sanitation; Water Microbiology; Water Quality; Water Supply; Young Adult,drinking water; adolescent; adult; cross-sectional study; Ethiopia; female; human; male; microbiology; middle aged; refugee; refugee camp; sanitation; water quality; water supply; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drinking Water; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Refugee Camps; Refugees; Sanitation; Water Microbiology; Water Quality; Water Supply; Young Adult,,Nature Research,20452322,,,40251255,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003162551

However, it remains challenging to translate wastewater SARS-CoV-2 viral load to infection number, due to unclear shedding patterns in wastewater and potential differences between variants. Objectives: We utilized comprehensive wastewater surveillance data and estimates of infection prevalence (i.e., the source of the viral shedding) available for New York City (NYC) to characterize SARS-CoV-2 fecal shedding pattern over multiple COVID-19 waves. Methods: We collected SARS-CoV-2 viral wastewater measurements in NYC during August 31, 2020 – August 29, 2023 (N = 3794 samples). Combining with estimates of infection prevalence (number of infectious individuals including those not detected as cases), we estimated the time-lag, duration, and per-infection fecal shedding rate for the ancestral/Iota, Delta, and Omicron variants, separately. We also developed a procedure to identify occasions with intensified transmission. Results: Models suggested fecal viral shedding likely starts around the same time as and lasts slightly longer than respiratory tract shedding. Estimated fecal viral shedding rate was highest during the ancestral/Iota variant wave, at 1.44 (95% CI: 1.35 – 1.53) billion RNA copies in wastewater per day per infection (measured by RT-qPCR), and decreased by around 20% and 50-60% during the Delta wave and Omicron period, respectively. We identified around 200 occasions during which the wastewater SARS-CoV-2 viral load exceeded the expected level in any of the city's 14 sewersheds. These anomalies disproportionally occurred during late January, late April—early May, early August, and from late-November to late-December, with frequencies exceeding the expectation assuming random occurrence (P < 0.05; bootstrapping test). Discussion: These estimates may be useful in understanding changes in underlying infection rate and help quantify changes in COVID-19 transmission and severity over time. We have also demonstrated that wastewater surveillance data can support the identification of time periods with potentially intensified transmission.",Covid-19; Transmission; Variant; Viral Shedding Pattern; Wastewater Surveillance; Wastewater; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Epidemiology; Feces; Human; Isolation And Purification; New York; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Time Factor; Virology; Virus Load; Virus Shedding; Wastewater; Wastewater-based Epidemiology; Covid-19; Feces; Humans; New York City; Sars-cov-2; Sars-cov-2 Variants; Time Factors; Viral Load; Virus Shedding; Wastewater; Wastewater-based Epidemiological Monitoring,coronavirus disease 2019; epidemiology; feces; human; isolation and purification; New York; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; time factor; virology; virus load; virus shedding; wastewater; wastewater-based epidemiology; COVID-19; Feces; Humans; New York City; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2 variants; Time Factors; Viral Load; Virus Shedding; Wastewater; Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring,,BioMed Central Ltd,14712458,,,40128707,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000788926

However, the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in these sediments and seasonal influence remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the presence and temporal distribution of foodborne pathogens, including Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in water-overlying sediments at selected locations in Conococheague Creek. Over a three-year period, sediment samples were analyzed to enumerate total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and generic E. coli. Results indicated a substantial microbial presence, with total coliforms showing the highest average concentrations, particularly during the warmer seasons. Compared to other sampling sites, FIB concentrations were consistently higher at the SS site, a location characterized by low-intensity urban development. Both Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes were detected across all tested sites, with L. monocytogenes observed more frequently than Salmonella spp. Additionally, a higher prevalence of Salmonella spp. was observed during the warmer months, suggesting seasonal influences on its detection. Conversely, L. monocytogenes was detected throughout the year, with a significant increase during the colder seasons. The I81 site, an area dominated by agricultural activities like crops and pasture production, showed higher prevalence of Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes compared to the other two sites, suggesting a greater contamination risk in irrigation water sources.

This study investigates the prevalence and intensity of O. viverrini metacercariae in cyprinoid fish from the Nong Han Wetland in Northeast Thailand, and assesses fish abundance and environmental factors influencing parasite distribution. Fish were sampled monthly at eight sites during the rainy (June – October 2024) and dry (November 2024 – March 2025) seasons. Fish species were identified, and their relative abundance and species diversity (Shannon-Wiener index (H′)) were assessed. Cyprinoid fish were digested with 0.25 % pepsin-HCl to detect, identified and quantify O. viverrini metacercariae under a microscope. Concurrent water quality paramteters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and fecal coliform levels) were analyzed to assess their correlation with parasite distribution. A total of 1429 fish from 36 species were collected, with Trichogaster vittatus (Family Belontiidae) being the most abundant. Among 392 cyprinoid fish (Family Cyprinidae) from 11 species (H′ = 1.8), 15.1 % were infected with O. viverrini metacercariae found in 6 species. Cyclocheilichthys apogon showed the significant highest prevalence (20.3 %). Infection intensity was highest in Barbonymus gonionotus and Hampala dispar (6.0 metacercariae/infected fish). Higher fecal coliform levels and proximity to human settlements correlated with infection. Dry season prevalence (17.8 %) and intensity (5.1 ± 2.6) were significantly greater than the rainy season (11.0 % and 2.6 ± 1.1, P ≤ 0.001). A strong correlation existed between fecal coliforms and O. viverrini prevalence (r = 0.981, P ≤ 0.001), with hotspots near human settlements.

This study aimed to identify factors associated with death in COVID-19 patients by considering clinical, demographic, environmental, and socioeconomic conditions, using machine learning models and a national dataset from Mexico covering all pandemic waves. We integrated data from the national COVID-19 dataset, municipal-level socioeconomic indicators, and water quality contaminants (physicochemical and microbiological). Patients were assigned to one of four datasets (groundwater, lentic, lotic, and coastal) based on their municipality of residence. We trained XGBoost models to predict patient death or survival on balanced subsets of each dataset. Hyperparameters were optimized using a grid search and cross-validation, and feature importance was analyzed using SHAP values, point-biserial correlation, and XGBoost metrics. The models achieved strong predictive performance (F1 score > 0.97). Key risk factors included older age (≥50 years), pneumonia, intubation, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease, while outpatient status, younger age (<40 years), contact with a confirmed case, and care in private medical units were associated with survival.

Since Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) can induce MS-like demyelination, TMEV infection is the most widely used viral model for MS. Although the precise pathophysiology is unknown, altered fecal bacterial populations were associated with distinct immune gene expressions in the CNS. We aimed to determine the role of gut microbiota in TMEV infection by administering an antibiotic cocktail in drinking water before (prophylactic administration) or after (therapeutic administration) TMEV infection. The antibiotic administration reduced total eubacteria, including the phyla Bacillota and Bacteroidota, but increased the phylum Pseudomonadata in feces. Prophylactic administration did not alter TMEV-induced inflammatory demyelination clinically or histologically, without changes in anti-viral IgG1/IgG2c levels or lymphoproliferative responses; therapeutic administration temporarily suppressed the neurological signs. Although antibiotic treatment had minimal effects on TMEV infection, adding metronidazole and ampicillin in drinking water substantially reduced water intake in the antibiotic group of mice, resulting in significant body weight loss. Since dehydration and stress could affect immune responses and gut microbiota, caution should be exercised when planning or evaluating the oral antibiotic cocktail treatment in experimental animals.","16s Rrna; Animal Models; Antibody Isotype; Cns Demyelinating Disease; Intestinal Bacterial Flora; Microbiome; Neuroinflammation; Paraffin Section; Picornaviridae Infections; Theiler’s Virus Model; Ampicillin; Isoflurane; Metronidazole; Neomycin; Vancomycin; Anti-bacterial Agents; Hm 325 Rotary Microtome; Origin Pro 2025; Qiaamp Fast Dna Stool Mini Kit; Steponeplus System; Sybr + Rox Mix; Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-mode Microplate Reader; Ampicillin; Antibiotic Agent; Genomic Dna; Immunoglobulin G1; Immunoglobulin G2; Isoflurane; Metronidazole; Neomycin; Vancomycin; Antiinfective Agent; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Antibiotic Therapy; Article; Bacteroides; Bifidobacterium; Blood Sampling; Body Weight; Body Weight Loss; Controlled Study; Dehydration; Demyelination; Dna Extraction; Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Gene Expression; Histology; Immune Response; Immunohistochemistry; Intestine Flora; Mouse; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurodisability; Neuropathology; Nonhuman; Pathophysiology; Persistent Virus Infection; Plaque Forming Unit; Pseudomonadata; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Theiler Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus-induced Demyelinating Disease; Theiler's Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus; Animal; C57bl Mouse; Disease Model; Drug Effect; Drug Therapy; Female; Microbiology; Oral Drug Administration; Theilovirus; Virology; Administration, Oral; Animals; Anti-bacterial Agents; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57bl; Multiple Sclerosis","ampicillin; antibiotic agent; genomic DNA; immunoglobulin G1; immunoglobulin G2; isoflurane; metronidazole; neomycin; vancomycin; antiinfective agent; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibiotic therapy; Article; Bacteroides; Bifidobacterium; blood sampling; body weight; body weight loss; controlled study; dehydration; demyelination; DNA extraction; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gene expression; histology; immune response; immunohistochemistry; intestine flora; mouse; multiple sclerosis; neurodisability; neuropathology; nonhuman; pathophysiology; persistent virus infection; plaque forming unit; Pseudomonadata; real time polymerase chain reaction; Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease; Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus; animal; C57BL mouse; disease model; drug effect; drug therapy; female; microbiology; oral drug administration; Theilovirus; virology; Administration, Oral; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Multiple Sclerosis",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),20734409,,,40558498,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009161418

This study investigated the spatial and seasonal behavior of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in the Santiago-Guadalajara River Basin (SGRB) using the most probable number (MPN) microbiological quantification technique and measuring the tributary flow rates in the main stem of the river and tributaries. Twenty-five sampling sites were monitored from July 2021 to April 2022. The mean of the microbial counts (MPN/100 mL) at the basin was as follows: total coliforms 2.5 × 107, fecal coliforms 2.2 × 107, and E. coli 2.1 × 107. These FIB values position the Santiago-Guadalajara River as one of the most polluted rivers globally since it significantly exceeds the regulatory limits at the monitored sites, indicating insufficient sanitation infrastructure throughout the basin. A high level of correlation was found between FIB concentrations and monitored stream tributary flows, which allowed modeling the behavior of the FIB with respect to the flow regime throughout the basin. Quantitative microbial risk assessment revealed specific stations with elevated infection risks from Escherichia coli exposure. This field-based study provides valuable insights into the relationship between the variables that influence FIB concentrations in a highly polluted river and the potential risk to the exposed population.",Fecal Indicator Bacteria; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment; Santiago-guadalajara River Basin; Seasonal Variation; Water Quality Monitoring; Health Risks; River Pollution; Water Pollution Control; Bacteria Concentrations; Faecal Indicator Bacteria; Most Probable Number; Polluted Rivers; Potential Risks; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment; River Basins; Santiago-guadalajarum River Basin; Seasonal Variation; Water Quality Monitoring; Escherichia Coli; Coliform Bacterium; Environmental Monitoring; Quantitative Analysis; Risk Assessment; River Pollution; Seasonal Variation; Water Quality; Agricultural Waste; Article; Bacterium Contamination; Fecal Coliform; Fecal Indicator Bacteria; Flow Rate; Fluid Intake; Health Outcome; Industrial Waste; Irrigation (agriculture); Microbial Risk Assessment; Microorganism; Most Probable Number; Municipal Wastewater; Nonhuman; Polluted River; River; Wastewater; Water Supply; Bacterium; Feces; Mexico; Microbiology; Water Pollution; Lerma Basin [mexico]; Lerma-chapala-santiago River Basin; Mexico [north America]; Santiago River; Bacteria; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Risk Assessment; Rivers; Water Microbiology; Water Pollution,Health risks; River pollution; Water pollution control; Bacteria concentrations; Faecal indicator bacteria; Most probable number; Polluted rivers; Potential risks; Quantitative microbial risk assessment; River basins; Santiago-guadalajarum river basin; Seasonal variation; Water quality monitoring; Escherichia coli; coliform bacterium; environmental monitoring; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; river pollution; seasonal variation; water quality; agricultural waste; Article; bacterium contamination; fecal coliform; fecal indicator bacteria; flow rate; fluid intake; health outcome; industrial waste; irrigation (agriculture); microbial risk assessment; microorganism; most probable number; municipal wastewater; nonhuman; polluted river; river; wastewater; water supply; bacterium; feces; Mexico; microbiology; water pollution; Lerma Basin [Mexico]; Lerma-Chapala-Santiago River Basin; Mexico [North America]; Santiago River; Bacteria; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Risk Assessment; Rivers; Water Microbiology; Water Pollution,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,15732959; 01676369,,EMASD,40392376,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105005497758

Escherichia coli (E. coli) serves as an indicator of faecal contamination and the potential presence of other harmful pathogens. Understanding E. coli concentrations helps in assessing the overall health risks associated with waterborne diseases and developing effective water management strategies. Therefore, we developed the first large-scale model, GloWPa-Ecoli C1 to simulate E. coli loads and concentrations in rivers and apply this model to China. The model provides the first comprehensive overview of microbial water quality across China's rivers. The model simulates E. coli concentrations in 2020 to range from 10−1.2 to 106.3 CFU/L, with 45.6 %–78.1 % of rivers exhibiting poor microbial water quality. Major hotspots of E. coli pollution are Haihe, Huaihe and Pearl River Basins. Direct discharge of human faecal waste contributes 80.2 % of the total E. coli load, while directly discharged livestock waste accounts for 13.1 %. To mitigate E. coli pollution in rivers in China, we recommend increasing human faecal waste collection rates, expanding wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) coverage, phasing out primary treatment WWTPs and eliminating direct livestock faecal waste discharge, particularly from smallholder farms. The study underscores the urgent need to improve microbial water quality in China's rivers. The findings provide actionable insights to inform policy development aimed at safeguarding water quality and public health. Furthermore, the modelling approach is applicable to other regions and microorganisms, offering a foundation for developing models to address antibiotic-resistant bacteria and other emerging water quality challenges.","E.

However, this growth is challenged by microbial infections, particularly those caused by the emerging pathogen Aeromonas dhakensis. This study aimed to investigate the microbial community composition across four distinct tilapia farming systems and assess associated water physicochemical parameters, with a focus on detecting the presence of A. dhakensis and elucidating its environmental associations. Water physicochemical parameters were measured to evaluate environmental conditions, microbial communities were characterized through 16S rDNA metabarcoding, and A. dhakensis was detected using both microbiological and molecular approaches. Principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were employed to explore the influence of environmental variables and microbial community dynamics on pathogen occurrence. Our results indicated that floating cages exhibited higher levels of temperature, ammonium, and fecal coliform, while cement tanks showed signs of nutrient accumulation. PCA revealed that both systems were associated with degraded water quality. A total of 45 A. dhakensis strains with distinct fingerprints were isolated. The 16S metabarcoding revealed Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetota as the dominant phyla. Alpha diversity did not differ significantly among pond systems, while beta diversity revealed variations in microbial assemblages across aquaculture systems. CCA identified dissolved oxygen, temperature, macronutrients (phosphate, ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite), and turbidity as significant environmental drivers shaping the microbial community structure across the pond systems. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of environmental factors, particularly dissolved oxygen, temperature, and nutrient levels, in shaping microbial community composition and potentially influencing the presence of pathogenic bacteria such as A. dhakensis.

Alongside this growth, their fecal contamination of surface waters has impaired water quality through significantly increased levels of pathogenic bacteria, raising concerns over the potential for zoonotic disease transmission. Significant remediation of these water quality impacts has been shown as a result of reductions in wild pig populations due to control efforts; however, the duration of these remediation effects as populations rebound remains unclear. Our study sought to determine the longevity of water quality remediation resulting from wild pig population control efforts. We found that median concentrations of Escherichia coli and fecal coliform (CFU/100 mL) increased by 746% and 159% in the year following the conclusion of removal efforts, resulting in median concentrations of 79% and 159% greater than those observed prior. We also found increased public health risk, with samples exceeding E. coli and fecal coliform guidelines 10% and 12% more often than pre-removal, respectively. While further research into wild pig population dynamics and fecal contamination is necessary, we conclude that ongoing population control efforts may be necessary to remediate water quality impacts and public health risks associated with invasive wild pigs.",Escherichia Coli; Remediation; Water Pollution Control; Control Effort; Fecal Coliform; Fecal Contamination; Impaired Water; Mammalian Species; Median Concentration; Pathogenic Bacterium; Population Control; Public Health Risks; Water Quality Impact; Water Pollution; Article; Bacterial Load; Colony Forming Unit; European Wild Boar; Fecal Coliform; Health Hazard; Nonhuman; Population Dynamics; Public Health; Stream (river); Water Contamination; Water Management; Water Quality; Animal; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Microbiology; Pig; River; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Rivers; Sus Scrofa; Swine; Water Microbiology; Water Quality,Escherichia coli; Remediation; Water pollution control; Control effort; Fecal Coliform; Fecal contamination; Impaired water; Mammalian species; Median concentration; Pathogenic bacterium; Population control; Public health risks; Water quality impact; Water pollution; Article; bacterial load; colony forming unit; European wild boar; fecal coliform; health hazard; nonhuman; population dynamics; public health; stream (river); water contamination; water management; water quality; animal; environmental monitoring; feces; microbiology; pig; river; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Rivers; Sus scrofa; Swine; Water Microbiology; Water Quality,,John Wiley and Sons Inc,00472425; 15372537,,JEVQA,39931802,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218811270

These organisms are responsible for causing diarrheal, gastroenteritis, cholera, and typhoid diseases which raise an alarming sense on public human health due to the high mortality rate, especially in children. Several studies have indicated that these waterborne diseases can be managed by monitoring pathogens in water using traditional culture-based and molecular techniques. However, these methods have shown several setbacks such as the longer duration for detection and the inability to detect pathogens at low concentrations. Effective management of these diseases requires rapid, sensitive, highly selective, fast, and efficient economic methods to monitor pathogens in water. Since the creation of biosensors, these tools have been applied and shown the ability to detect pathogens at low concentrations. The highlights of biosensor systems are that they are fast, portable, easy to use, highly sensitive, and specific. The capabilities of biosensors have given these tools exposure to be widely applied in detecting pharmaceutical pollutants, pesticides, toxins, residues of detergents, and cosmetics from household activities in soil and water. With such difficulties faced for detecting waterborne pathogens, this review evaluates the effectiveness of technologies for waterborne pathogens detection and their drawbacks. It further highlights biosensors as the current reliable method available for detecting pathogens in water and its future capabilities in sustaining safe potable water.",Biosensors; Chemiluminescence; Optical Biosensors; Pcr Detection Techniques; Water-borne Pathogens; Fertilizers; Listeria; Soaps (detergents); Detection Technology; Low Concentrations; Optical Bio-sensors; Pathogen Detection; Pcr Detection; Pcr Detection Technique; Run-off; Stormwaters; Water-borne Pathogens; Waterbodies; Diseases; Detergent; Pesticide; Agriculture; Detection Method; Disease Control; Drinking Water; Fecal Coliform; Industrial Waste; Luminescence; Monitoring System; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Public Health; Runoff; Safety; Sensor; Waterborne Disease; Biosensor; Chemoluminescence; Cholera; Controlled Study; Duration; Gastroenteritis; Household; Human; Infectious Agent; Microorganism Detection; Mortality Rate; Nonhuman; Optical Biosensor; Pharmaceutics; Review; Stormwater Runoff; Typhoid Fever; Water; Water Borne Disease; Environmental Monitoring; Genetic Procedures; Microbiology; Procedures; Biosensing Techniques; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Water Microbiology; Waterborne Diseases,Fertilizers; Listeria; Soaps (detergents); Detection technology; Low concentrations; Optical bio-sensors; Pathogen detection; PCR detection; PCR detection technique; Run-off; Stormwaters; Water-borne pathogens; Waterbodies; Diseases; detergent; pesticide; agriculture; detection method; disease control; drinking water; fecal coliform; industrial waste; luminescence; monitoring system; polymerase chain reaction; public health; runoff; safety; sensor; waterborne disease; biosensor; chemoluminescence; cholera; controlled study; duration; gastroenteritis; household; human; infectious agent; microorganism detection; mortality rate; nonhuman; optical biosensor; pharmaceutics; review; stormwater runoff; typhoid fever; water; water borne disease; environmental monitoring; genetic procedures; microbiology; procedures; Biosensing Techniques; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Water Microbiology; Waterborne Diseases,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,15732959; 01676369,,EMASD,39903332,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217989381

This study evaluated the relationship between specific water parameters, public satisfaction with treated water, and diarrhea incidence in Southwestern Goiás, Brazil. The objectives were (1) to assess water parameters, including aluminum, iron, manganese, pH, hardness, fecal coliforms, and turbidity, in samples from springs, streams, and municipal supplies; (2) to evaluate residents’ satisfaction with municipal water and their reliance on untreated water sources; and (3) to analyze the impact of transitioning from untreated to treated water following the closure of a spring in 2017 on diarrheal diseases. A longitudinal observational study reviewed diarrhea cases from 2013 to 2019. Treated water met potability standards, while untreated springs showed significant contamination. Dissatisfaction with treated water correlated strongly with continued reliance on untreated springs (p < 0.05), increasing the diarrhea risk nearly ninefold (OR = 8.78; 95% CI = 4.37–18.29). The findings underscore the importance of transitioning to treated water for mitigating diarrheal diseases and enhancing public trust in water safety.

However, GW is highly susceptible to contamination from anthropogenic activities. In the Bono East region of Ghana, 94 % of solid waste and 89 % of wastewater are disposed of on the roadside without treatment, posing a contamination risk to water resources. Despite the potential for GW contamination in the region, few researchers have assessed GW quality, and none has evaluated the human infectious risk from GW consumption. In this case study, GW quality in the Apaaso-Tafo community in the region was assessed and the infectious health risks posed to consumers were evaluated. Twenty GW samples were collected from ten boreholes. The concentrations of metals (Ca2+, Mg2+ and Fe) were determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy, bacteria (total and faecal coliform) using Multiple Tube Fermentation and Membrane Filter Techniques, and physicochemical qualities using electrometric, titrimetric, argentometric and spectrophotometric methods. The water quality indices (WQI) and the infection probability from drinking the GW were computed. The WQI showed that most (80 %) GW samples are within acceptable limits. Except for the pH, temperature, turbidity and total coliform bacteria, all parameters met the WHO standards. 40 % of the boreholes contained 50 to 500 cfu/100 mL of coliform bacteria and posed daily infection risks between 1 and 7.63 %. It is recommended that standpipes on boreholes be fitted with membrane or nano filters capable of removing bacteria and viruses to reduce infection risk. The authorities should also monitor GW quality regularly and respond to changes in quality with the appropriate intervention such as issuing ‘boil-before-drinking’ notices to consumers or encouraging parents to provide bottled and sachet water for their young children. Future research with an increased number of communities, sample size and sampling frequency should also be conducted to enhance the generalisability of these findings.",Borehole; Ghana; Groundwater Quality; Human Infection Risk; Kintampo,,,Elsevier Ltd,24058440,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216888482

The aim of this study was to provide an overview of information available on which microorganisms were investigated and at which densities. Based on this platform we further aimed at identifying key microbial indicators and pathogens for monitoring water quality in these systems by integrating data from the top five waterborne outbreaks with findings from studies on (1) microbial investigations in reuse projects involving shower effluents or combined bathroom streams, (2) shower water effluents, and (3) biofilms in conventional showers. Outbreak data were extracted from the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) and a systematic literature review, supplemented with additional references found within the papers. Escherichia coli, Total Coliforms, enterococci as faecal indicator bacteria and the heterotrophic plate count were reported in shower effluents at variable, but generally high concentrations, indicating these organisms to be relevant as indication of faecal bacterial contamination and as general microbial densities in recirculating showers. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was abundant in conventional shower biofilms, detectable in shower effluents at concentrations in the range of 2–4 logs CFU/100 mL and ranked among the top five etiological agents of waterborne outbreaks. Consequently, P. aeruginosa is considered as a significant reference pathogen for assessing water quality in recirculating shower systems. A diverse range of Legionella species, particularly Legionella pneumophila, are the primary cause of waterborne outbreaks, and persist in conventional shower biofilms. Therefore, we consider it to be significant as an indicator species in monitoring water quality. Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium spp., and fungi such as Candida albicans could serve as supplementary microbial parameters. Trace organisms such as protozoa (Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp.) and model viruses are also recommended for assessing treatment efficacy. In conclusion, while further research is required to validate these findings, this review critically evaluates relevant pathogens, creating the basis for future microbial water quality assessments in recirculating showers.",Faecal Pathogens; Microbial Risk; Recirculating Showers; Water-based Pathogens; Candida; River Pollution; Staphylococcus Aureus; Viruses; Fecal Pathogen; Microbial Indicators; Microbial Risk; Microbials; Monitoring Water Quality; Recirculating Shower; Water And Energies; Water Based; Water-based Pathogen; Water-borne Outbreaks; Escherichia Coli; Biofilm; Concentration (composition); Disease Incidence; Literature Review; Microbial Activity; Pathogen; Recirculating System; Risk Assessment; Water Quality; Water Technology; Bacterium Contamination; Candida Albicans; Coliform Bacterium; Colony Forming Unit; Controlled Study; Cryptosporidium; Effluent; Giardia; Infectious Agent; Legionella; Legionella Pneumophila; Mycobacterium; Nonhuman; Plate Count; Protozoon; Pseudomonas Aeruginosa; Quality Control; Review; Water; Bacterium; Environmental Monitoring; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Procedures; Bacteria; Biofilms; Environmental Monitoring; Water Microbiology; Water Quality,Candida; River pollution; Staphylococcus aureus; Viruses; Fecal pathogen; Microbial indicators; Microbial risk; Microbials; Monitoring water quality; Recirculating shower; Water and energies; Water based; Water-based pathogen; Water-borne outbreaks; Escherichia coli; biofilm; concentration (composition); disease incidence; literature review; microbial activity; pathogen; recirculating system; risk assessment; water quality; water technology; bacterium contamination; Candida albicans; coliform bacterium; colony forming unit; controlled study; Cryptosporidium; effluent; Giardia; infectious agent; Legionella; Legionella pneumophila; Mycobacterium; nonhuman; plate count; protozoon; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; quality control; review; water; bacterium; environmental monitoring; isolation and purification; microbiology; procedures; Bacteria; Biofilms; Environmental Monitoring; Water Microbiology; Water Quality,,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,39884193,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216281110

Eight representative sampling locations were selected, and samples were collected twice a year, i.e., in the dry and wet seasons, for a total of 16 samples. The fecal coliform (FC) to fecal streptococci (FS) ratio was used to identify the source of fecal contamination. Results showed severe fecal contamination levels exceeding the allowable limits of WHO and Pak-EPA. Except for pH and TDS, the physical parameters were also not found within allowable limits at various sampling locations. The comparison of dry and wet seasons reveals higher microbial loads in the wet season. The FC/FS ratio linked polluted waters to human sources (37.5%), animal sources (25%), mixed pollution with the dominance of human pollution (25%), and mixed pollution with the dominance of domestic pollution (12.5%) in dry and human sources (25%), animal sources (25%), mixed pollution with the dominance of human pollution (37.5%) and mixed pollution with the dominance of domestic pollution (12.5%) in wet season. Pearson’s correlation test showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.71 to 0.99) between TDS and salinity in both dry and wet seasons, and a moderately strong correlation (r = 0.41 to 0.70) between various microbial and physical parameters. It is strongly advised that careless municipal wastewater disposal into rivers be prohibited. To prevent contaminated water from mixing with river water, an appropriate sewage and drainage system should be implemented.",E.

Open air markets, while providing fresh and affordable foods, often have unhygienic practices that may contribute to contamination during the slaughter and processing of chicken meat. This study examines whether and how the common practice of rinse water (stored water used for rinsing broiler carcasses during processing) reuse leads to accumulation of pathogens, with potential cross contamination of chicken meat. To assess the accumulation of Campylobacter jejuni/coli, Salmonella spp., and the indicator of fecal contamination, Escherichia coli, in rinse water used during the slaughtering process at open air food markets in Maputo, Mozambique. We conducted a time-series study at three open air food markets. In a first experiment, we collected paired rinse water (N = 70), water used for chicken processing, and broiler chicken carcass (N = 60) samples from 10 vendors at 75-min intervals starting prior to any processing activity. In a second experiment, we collected 100, 50 mL rinse water samples, immediately before and after processing, from 10 vendors. Chicken processing activity and associated hygiene practices were captured through direct observation. Vendors processed 24 chickens per day, on average. In the first experiment, C. jejuni/coli and E. coli were detected in 30 % and 80 % of rinse water samples, respectively, prior to processing (baseline), and no Salmonella was detected. After the first carcass rinse, C. jejuni/coli and E. coli were detected in 100 % of samples, and Salmonella spp. was detected in 42 % of rinse water samples and 48 % of carcass samples. C. jejuni/coli showed an average 0.1 log<inf>10</inf> copies (95 % CI 0.0, 0.2) increase in rinse water and carcass samples every 75 min. In the second experiment, no C. jejuni/coli or Salmonella spp. were detected in baseline rinse water samples, and E. coli were detected in 78 % of baseline rinse water samples. After processing the first carcass, C. jejuni/coli were detected in 100 % of remaining samples, Salmonella spp. were detected in 28 % of pre-final rinse and 36 % of post-final rinse samples, and E. coli were detected in 81 % of pre-final rinse and 100 % of post-final rinse samples. Our results reveal that consumers are at a high risk of purchasing chicken meat contaminated with human enteropathogens. Once contaminated, rinse water stays contaminated throughout the day. Low-cost and feasible interventions implemented at the carcass wash step are needed to reduce microbial hazards on chicken meat before purchase.",C. Jejuni/coli; Chicken Processing; E.

Consequently, there is a pressing need for a rapid and precise method to identify bacterial contaminants in drinking water. The objective of this study was to investigate the protein profiles of various bacterial species present in water through the application of protein fingerprinting (PF) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) techniques, as well as to evaluate their antimicrobial resistance. A total of two hundred water samples were collected from five distinct locations within the Qassim region of Saudi Arabia. The bacterial isolates were identified via the protein fingerprinting analytical technique (PFAT), which was subsequently confirmed via real-time PCR. The Kirby–Bauer method was employed to assess antibiotic resistance among the bacterial isolates. Among the 200 water samples analyzed, PFAT successfully identified 123 bacterial isolates, with the most frequently isolated species being 48 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), 17 Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and 16 Escherichia coli (E. coli). All the waterborne bacterial isolates were accurately identified 100% of the time, achieving a score of 2.00 or higher. The results from real-time PCR indicated that 87.5% of the P. aeruginosa isolates were positive for the oprI gene, all the S. aureus isolates were positive for the nuc gene, and 93.75% of the E. coli isolates were positive for the fliC gene. P. aeruginosa isolates presented a high level of resistance to aztreonam (64.6%), whereas S. aureus presented significant resistance to cefoxitin and cefepime (88.24%), followed by aztreonam (82.35%) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (70.6%). E. coli isolates were completely resistant to ampicillin (100%), with high resistance also observed against amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin (87.5%), and cefepime (81.25%). This study underscores the importance of utilizing PFATs for the microbiological identification of diverse water samples as a reliable and effective method. Furthermore, these findings emphasize the necessity for the regular surveillance and monitoring of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in drinking water sources.","Contaminated Groundwater; Drinking Water; Microbiological Analysis; Protein Expression; Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Water Safety; Amoxicillin; Amoxicillin Plus Clavulanic Acid; Ampicillin; Aztreonam; Cefepime; Cefoxitin; Clavulanic Acid; Anti-bacterial Agents; Drinking Water; Amoxicillin; Amoxicillin Plus Clavulanic Acid; Ampicillin; Antiinfective Agent; Aztreonam; Cefepime; Cefoxitin; Clavulanic Acid; Drinking Water; Antibiotic Resistance; Antimicrobial Activity; Article; Bacterial Count; Controlled Study; Escherichia Coli; Fecal Coliform; Mass Spectrometry; Microbiology; Nonhuman; Protein Expression; Protein Fingerprinting; Pseudomonas Aeruginosa; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Saudi Arabia; Staphylococcus Aureus; Water Contamination; Water Sampling; Water Supply; Bacterium; Drug Effect; Genetics; Human; Isolation And Purification; Microbial Sensitivity Test; Procedures; Anti-bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Drinking Water; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Water Microbiology","amoxicillin; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; ampicillin; antiinfective agent; aztreonam; cefepime; cefoxitin; clavulanic acid; drinking water; antibiotic resistance; antimicrobial activity; Article; bacterial count; controlled study; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; mass spectrometry; microbiology; nonhuman; protein expression; protein fingerprinting; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; real time polymerase chain reaction; Saudi Arabia; Staphylococcus aureus; water contamination; water sampling; water supply; bacterium; drug effect; genetics; human; isolation and purification; microbial sensitivity test; procedures; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Drinking Water; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Water Microbiology",,Cellular and Molecular Biology Association,01455680; 1165158X,,CMBID,39910940,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217736754

Although numerous studies have investigated the bacteriological quality of drinking water in Ethiopia, their findings have been inconsistent and varied, hindering the implementation of effective water quality monitoring. Moreover, there is a lack of nationwide assessment of the bacteriological quality of drinking water in Ethiopia. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the bacteriological quality of drinking water and its associated factors in Ethiopia. Methods An international electronic database, including PubMed, Science Direct, Global Health, CINAHL, African Journals Online, HINARI, and Google Scholar was employed to retrieve the relevant articles. The study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA) guidelines. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect size, and the Egger regression model was employed using STATA 14 software to assess potential publication bias. Results A total of 26 studies involving 7,962 water samples met the eligibility criteria for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of at least one bacteriological contamination of drinking water was 52.26% (95%CI: 39.09-65.43), with extreme heterogeneity (I2 = 99.7%; p-value < 0.001). The pooled prevalence of total and fecal coliform in drinking water was 49.55% (95% CI: 34.88-64.23) and 44.27% (95%CI: 34.36-54.19), respectively. 14.13% of the water source was at a very high sanitary risk level (unfit for drinking), with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 94.1%, p< 0.001). The absence of household-level water treatment (OR = 3.3; 95%CI: 1.28-5.32) and drawing water using dipping methods (OR = 4.52; 95%CI: 1.71-7.34) were determinant factors for bacteriological contamination of drinking water. Conclusion We found that the bacteriological quality of drinking water did not comply with the World Health Organization and Ethiopia’s standard guidelines for drinking water, which call for urgent intervention. One out of seven water sources was at a high sanitary risk level, which could increase the risk of infectious disease in the country. The absence of household-level water treatment and drawing water using dipping was a significant factor in the bacteriological quality of drinking water. Based on these findings, the water supply and sewerage authority should prioritize regular monitoring of the bacteriological quality of drinking water.",Drinking Water; Drinking Water; Article; Bacterium Contamination; Data Quality Assessment; Escherichia Coli; Fecal Coliform; Meta Analysis; Nonhuman; Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews And Meta-analyses; Prevalence; Publication Bias; Quality Control; Sanitation; Sensitivity Analysis; Systematic Review; Water Contamination; Water Quality; Water Supply; Water Treatment; World Health Organization; Epidemiology; Ethiopia; Human; Microbiology; Drinking Water; Humans; Water Microbiology; Water Quality,drinking water; Article; bacterium contamination; data quality assessment; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; meta analysis; nonhuman; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; prevalence; publication bias; quality control; sanitation; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; water contamination; water quality; water supply; water treatment; World Health Organization; epidemiology; Ethiopia; human; microbiology; Drinking Water; Humans; Water Microbiology; Water Quality,,Public Library of Science,19326203,,POLNC,39752377,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214101225

Environmental factors such as geomorphology, land use, human activities, and seasonality could influence pathogen dissemination. This study performed a space-temporal analysis of Escherichia coli concentrations, virulence (eaeA, bfpA, stx2, aatA, and st), and resistance (tetA, blaTEM, blaOXA, Intl-1, Intl-2, sul-1, and sul-2) genes in surface water within the Virilla sub-watershed, Costa Rica. The research employs microbiological, geostatistical, and quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) techniques to evaluate the health risks associated with diarrheagenic E. coli. Samples collected monthly over a year were analyzed for fecal coliforms, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, physicochemical parameters, and the presence of virulence and resistance genes. The geographically weighted regression model identified significant associations between the virulence and resistance genes presence and environmental factors influence such as land use, slope, altitude, and seasonal changes. The results show that urban and grazing land use significantly influence the presence of resistance genes, while human fecal pollution is associated with higher concentrations of virulence genes. Seasonal variations showed that wet seasons contributed to increased gene presence (number of positive samples) and diversity (variety of virulence and resistance genes) compared with dry season. The QMRA results indicated that the total health disease burden was higher than the benchmark for drinking water recommended by WHO (1.00 × 10−6 DALY – Disability-Adjusted Life Years – per person per year) by between one and four magnitudes orders, particularly in regions with urban and grazing land use, human fecal pollution class, and lower altitudes. This study highlights the relevance of integrating environmental and microbial data to enhance water quality management and public health strategies in resource-limited regions. It underscores the need for targeted interventions, such as improved wastewater treatment and establishing buffer zones, to mitigate the risks associated with microbial pollution in surface waters.","Antibiotic Resistance Genes; Daly; Geographically Weighted Regression; Microbial Water Pollution; Qmra; Spatial-temporal Analysis; Virulence Genes; Dreamtaq Hotstart Master Mix; R Statistical Language Version 4.4.0; Benchmarking; Diseases; Escherichia Coli; Haze Pollution; Network Performance; Antibiotic Resistance Genes; Daly; Geographically Weighted Regression; Microbial Pollution; Microbial Water Pollution; Microbials; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment; Resistance Genes; Spatial Temporal Analysis; Virulence Gene; Wastewater Treatment; Rna 16s; Surface Water; Antibiotic Resistance; Coliform Bacterium; Gene; Regression Analysis; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Virulence; Water Pollution; Watershed; Article; Bacterial Virulence; Disability-adjusted Life Year; Ecosystem; Enterococcus Faecalis; Environmental Factor; Fecal Coliform; Genetic Variability; Genotype; Limit Of Detection; Microbial Community; Microbial Diversity; Monte Carlo Method; Nonhuman; Ph Measurement; Physical Chemistry; Prevalence; Risk Assessment; Salmonella Enterica Serovar Enteritidis; Sensitivity Analysis; Turbidity; Water Quality; Bacterial Gene; Costa Rica; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Genetics; Human; Microbiology; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Genes, Bacterial; Humans; Risk Assessment; Spatio-temporal Analysis; Virulence; Water Microbiology","Benchmarking; Diseases; Escherichia coli; Haze pollution; Network performance; Antibiotic resistance genes; DALY; Geographically weighted regression; Microbial pollution; Microbial water pollution; Microbials; Quantitative microbial risk assessment; Resistance genes; Spatial temporal analysis; Virulence gene; Wastewater treatment; RNA 16S; surface water; antibiotic resistance; coliform bacterium; gene; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; virulence; water pollution; watershed; Article; bacterial virulence; disability-adjusted life year; ecosystem; Enterococcus faecalis; environmental factor; fecal coliform; genetic variability; genotype; limit of detection; microbial community; microbial diversity; Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; pH measurement; physical chemistry; prevalence; risk assessment; Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis; sensitivity analysis; turbidity; water quality; bacterial gene; Costa Rica; environmental monitoring; feces; genetics; human; microbiology; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Genes, Bacterial; Humans; Risk Assessment; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Virulence; Water Microbiology",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,39674160,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211574672

Well water samples were collected from 15 different areas in 8 out of the 11 wards within Funtua Local Government, while three wards were excluded due to no record of the chlorella outbreak. Water samples were collected twice for each season (dry and wet) from the 15 sampling locations throughout the study area and transported immediately to the laboratory for analysis. The samples were analyzed according to the standard methods and procedures of APHA (2005). Most of the physicochemical parameter results fell within the limits established by WHO (2011) and NSDWQ (2015), except for dissolved oxygen (DO), chloride, total dissolved solids (TDS), and electrical conductivity (EC). The maximum mean concentrations of pH, phosphate, and sulphate (7.64 ± 0.54, 19.23 ± 4.63 mg/L, and 1.12 ± 0.64 mg/L) were recorded in Danduste ward, while a low turbidity mean value of 2.96 ± 0.31 NTU was observed in Goya ward. The high total coliform and faecal coliform counts were recorded from well water samples in all the wards, while Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, and Salmonella typhi were the bacterial isolates identified during this study. Diarrhoea, typhoid, and dysentery were the most commonly reported waterborne diseases in most primary health centers within this study area. The study revealed that well water sources were located close to pit latrines, averaging 11.4 m, which is below the WHO-recommended safe distance of 30 m. The quality of well water in the Funtua Local Government Area has been compromised due to the proximity of some water sources to pit latrines, rendering the water unsuitable for use without prior treatment.",Bacteriological Quality And Waterborne Diseases; Faecal Matter; Groundwater Quality; Outbreak; Seepage Contaminat,,,Frontiers Media SA,26249375,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001522738

A total of 84 water samples were collected and analyzed for parameters including temperature, turbidity, pH, free residual chlorine (FRC), iron content, and the presence of coliform bacteria. The results reveal widespread deviations from WHO guidelines, with the mean water temperature (29.6°C) exceeding the recommended threshold of 15°C, and turbidity levels surpassing WHO limits in Hodan and Abdiaziz districts. Although pH values were largely within the acceptable range (6.16–7.04), variations across districts were observed. Critically, FRC levels (mean 0.02 mg/L) were far below the recommended range of 0.2–5 mg/L. Bacteriological contamination was pervasive, with total coliforms detected in all districts, and the highest levels recorded in Kahda (86.3 CFU/100 mL) and the lowest in Hamarwein (9.3 CFU/100 mL). Fecal coliforms were detected only in Hodan district (mean 37.4 CFU/100 mL).

While carcass washing is primarily done to enhance appearance by getting rid of visible contaminants, when poorly implemented, the intervention has the potential to become a source of contamination by introducing both spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, diminishing beef hygiene. The aim of this study was to investigate the bacteriological and chemical quality of slaughterhouse tap water used in washing beef carcasses in Kajiado slaughterhouses. Previous studies of slaughterhouse water quality in Kenya have not dealt with portable water, major focus being on quality of effluent prior to discharge. Total and faecal coliform, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella spp. in sampled water were examined with cultural methods. Water pH, temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, Iron (Fe), aluminium (Al), fluoride, nitrate, nitrite and ammoniacal nitrogen were determined using several analytical instruments. Three out of five tap water samples (60%) tested positive for E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa while one sample (20%) had isolates confirmed as having Salmonella species. Water sample temperatures ranged between 23.4 and 26.1 ℃which were over the World Health Organization's (WHO) regulatory level of 20 ℃. Forty percent of the samples exceeded Fe guidelines, recording 0.35 ppm (M3) and 0.24 ppm (M1C), with the latter also exceeding in EC (2533 ppm), and TDS (1260 ppm). One spring water (M1A) and one borehole water (M2A) sample had ammoniacal nitrogen and fluoride levels of 0.72 ppm and 2.05 ppm, respectively which were beyond the WHO regulatory limit. Aluminium and nitrate levels were low ranging from 0.027 to 0.059 ppm and 0.42 to 2.24 ppm, respectively. Nitrites were not detected. The study concluded that faecal contamination of water intended for beef hygiene and slaughterhouse sanitation operations raises public health concern for the presence of microbial risks including enteric pathogens and opportunistic infections. The study recommends sensitization of slaughterhouse management and local authority on role of water quality in slaughter operations and the establishment of sustainable water treatment and monitoring plans. Additionally, the study recommends further research to investigate seasonality of water quality and sustainable water treatment methods.",Carcass Washing; Chemical Water Quality; Faecal Contamination; Slaughterhouse Tap Water,,,African Scholarly Science Communications Trust (ASSCAT),16845358; 16845374,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000532184

This study was designed to assess the proximate composition, microbial quality, and heavy metal accumulation in the Nile tilapia fillet at three selected landing sites in Lake Tana. Fifteen samples were collected and analyzed. The mean moisture, ash, fat, protein, salt, and water activity were 81.76%, 0.98%, 1.88%, 14.04%, 0.14%, and 0.9869, respectively. The proximate contents varied slightly among sites but were not significantly different (p > 0.05). The mean aerobic mesophilic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, total coliform, and fecal coliform counts were 6.30 log CFU/g, 2.91 log CFU/g, 1.51 log MPN/g, and 0.89 log MPN/g, respectively. Such high microbial loads and the high counts of fecal coliforms are indicative of poor handling practices and unsanitary processing that might lead to foodborne illnesses and economic losses. In addition, the mean concentration of heavy metals in the tissue samples decreased in the order of chromium (0.165 mg/kg) > arsenic (0.085 mg/kg) > lead (0.054 mg/kg) > cadmium (0.010 mg/kg). Except for chromium, the concentrations of the assessed metals were below the maximum permissible limits. Long-term chromium exposure, especially in its hexavalent form, can pose significant health risks like respiratory issues, gastrointestinal distress, and even cancer. Therefore, identifying contamination sources, employing proper waste management strategies, continuous monitoring of heavy metal levels, and proper fish handling practices are highly recommended to address the health implications of microbial contamination and elevated chromium concentrations.",Contamination; Food Safety; Heavy Metals; Lake Tana; Nile Tilapia; Public Health,,,Elsevier Ltd,24058440,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211123441

Here, we conducted a prospective analysis of MCRPEC isolates from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), local residents' fecal (LRF), and international airplane waste (IAW) to investigate their genetic characteristics and transmission patterns circulating in human-environment domains. The MCRPEC prevalence was 2.43 % in WWTPs, 1.37 % in IAW and 0.69 % in LRF. MCRPEC showed substantial genetic diversity, encompassing 61 sequence types (primarily ST1011, ST101, and ST2705), 7 plasmid types (primarily IncI2), 8 phylogroups (primarily A and B1), 9 mcr-1-flanked lineages (primarily L5), 6 clusters (primarily C2 and C4), diverse serotypes, and 61.95 % transposon-containing strains. The mcr-1 gene co-existed with 46 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and 19 virulence factor genes (VFGs). Notably, 6 IncI2 plasmids carried the bla<inf>CTX-M</inf>, IS1380, and mcr-1 genes. MCRPEC from WWTPs harbored a greater number of ARGs (56.95 ± 5.99) but fewer VFGs (15.03 ± 6.40) compared to those from human-associated sources (LRF and IAW). ST1011, ST2705, IncHI2, and L7 were prevalent in WWTP-derived MCRPEC, whereas IncX4 and L3 were more common in human-derived MCRPEC. Genetic features such as ST101, ST48, IncI2, L4, L5, C2, and C4 were simultaneously present in strains from LRF, IAW, and WWTPs. Core genetic analyses also showed genetically similar MCRPEC strains across various geographic locations. The findings underscore the extensive dissemination, strong environmental adaptation, and clonal transmission of MCRPEC across diverse reservoirs, reinforcing the urgent need for coordinated multisectoral surveillance of human and environment interfaces to effectively mitigate further transmission.","Genetic Characteristics; International Airplane Waste; Local Residents' Fecal; Mcrpec; Transmission; Wastewater Treatment Plants; Amikacin; Ampicillin; Avibactam Plus Ceftazidime; Cefazolin; Cefepime; Cefotaxime; Cefoxitin; Ceftazidime; Cefuroxime; Chloramphenicol; Ciprofloxacin; Clavulanic Acid; Colistin; Cotrimoxazole; Ertapenem; Gentamicin; Imipenem; Meropenem; Nalidixic Acid; Sultamicillin; Tetracycline; Tigecycline; Anti-bacterial Agents; Colistin; Escherichia Coli Proteins; Mcr-1 Protein, E Coli; Wastewater; Illumina Novaseq 6000; Qubit; Spss Version 22.0; Vitek Ms; Algae; Effluent Treatment; Epidemiology; Land Fill; Plant Diseases; Antibiotic Resistance Genes; Colistin; Genetic Characteristics; Genomics; International Airplane Waste; Local Resident' Fecal; Local Residents; Mcr-1-positive Escherichia Coli; Virulence Factors; Waste Water Treatment Plants; Escherichia Coli; Amikacin; Ampicillin; Avibactam Plus Ceftazidime; Cefazolin; Cefepime; Cefotaxime; Cefoxitin; Ceftazidime; Cefuroxime; Chloramphenicol; Ciprofloxacin; Clavulanic Acid; Colistin; Cotrimoxazole; Ertapenem; Genomic Dna; Gentamicin; Imipenem; Meropenem; Nalidixic Acid; Sultamicillin; Tetracycline; Tigecycline; Virulence Factor; Antiinfective Agent; Escherichia Coli Protein; Mcr-1 Protein, E Coli; Air Transportation; Disease Prevalence; Disease Transmission; Epidemiology; Fecal Coliform; Genomics; Solid Waste; Wastewater Treatment Plant; Antibiotic Sensitivity; Article; Bacterial Gene; Bacterial Transmission; Bacterium Isolation; Blactx M Gene; Dna Extraction; Evolutionary Adaptation; Feces; Fluorometry; Gene Sequence; Genetic Analysis; Genetic Variability; International Airplane Waste; Is1380 Gene; Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometry; Mcr 1 Gene; Minimum Inhibitory Concentration; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Nonhuman; Phenotype; Phylogenetic Tree; Phylogeny; Prevalence; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Alignment; Serotype; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Transposon; Type Iii Secretion System; Waste; Waste Water Treatment Plant; Whole Genome Sequencing; Antibiotic Resistance; Drug Effect; Genetics; Human; Microbiology; Sewage; Wastewater; Anti-bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Escherichia Coli Proteins; Feces; Humans; Prevalence; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Wastewater","Algae; Effluent treatment; Epidemiology; Land fill; Plant diseases; Antibiotic resistance genes; Colistin; Genetic characteristics; Genomics; International airplane waste; Local resident' fecal; Local residents; Mcr-1-positive escherichia coli; Virulence factors; Waste water treatment plants; Escherichia coli; amikacin; ampicillin; avibactam plus ceftazidime; cefazolin; cefepime; cefotaxime; cefoxitin; ceftazidime; cefuroxime; chloramphenicol; ciprofloxacin; clavulanic acid; colistin; cotrimoxazole; ertapenem; genomic DNA; gentamicin; imipenem; meropenem; nalidixic acid; sultamicillin; tetracycline; tigecycline; virulence factor; antiinfective agent; Escherichia coli protein; MCR-1 protein, E coli; air transportation; disease prevalence; disease transmission; epidemiology; fecal coliform; genomics; solid waste; wastewater treatment plant; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial transmission; bacterium isolation; blaCTX M gene; DNA extraction; evolutionary adaptation; feces; fluorometry; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic variability; international airplane waste; IS1380 gene; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; mcr 1 gene; minimum inhibitory concentration; multilocus sequence typing; nonhuman; phenotype; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; prevalence; real time polymerase chain reaction; sequence alignment; serotype; single nucleotide polymorphism; transposon; type III secretion system; waste; waste water treatment plant; whole genome sequencing; antibiotic resistance; drug effect; genetics; human; microbiology; sewage; wastewater; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Escherichia coli Proteins; Feces; Humans; Prevalence; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Wastewater",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,39547379,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85209585524

Private well users face a higher risk of acute gastrointestinal illness compared to those served by municipally operated systems (Murphy et al., 2016). Accordingly, the current study sought to characterize the fecal indicator, E. coli, isolated from southeastern Ontario private groundwater wells, including phylogroups and host source. Results were examined in the context of antecedent climate and local hydrogeological setting to elucidate likely contaminant sources and pathways. A total of 737 E. coli isolates from 260 private wells were assigned to phylogroups using the Clermont PCR phylotyping method, with likely host source determined using host-specific Bacteroidales 16S rRNA RT qPCR assays. Multivariate models were developed for the main E. coli phylogroups (A, B1, B2, and D) and all microbial source tracking markers. Models were coupled for interpretation where possible, based on associations between phylogroups and MST markers. Preferential subsurface flow, and to a lesser degree, overland flow, were likely mechanisms of contamination across all models. Distinct temporal associations were found based on the fecal source. Multiple models were developed and will be discussed, in an attempt to elucidate source-specific contamination mechanisms, in support of risk assessment and appropriate protective actions.","Contamination Pathways; E.

The study aimed to assess the microbiological quality of drinking water from three communities along the Odaw River in Accra, known for their poor waste-disposal practices and incidents of flooding. Water samples were collected from community tap water and locally manufactured sachet-water from three flood-prone communities along the Odaw River, namely, Alajo, Avenor, and Agbogbloshie, and analysed for the presence of indicator organisms: total coliforms, faecal coliforms, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). All brands of sachet water sampled from the three communities had no microbial contamination. Conversely, most community tap water showed contamination with indicator organisms that exceeded the international standard of 0 per 100 mL for potable water. The presence of faecal coliforms and E. coli in community-shared tap water is an indication of poor water quality and may present a risk for waterborne disease outbreaks among households and communities.",Escherichia Coli; Faecal Coliforms; Indicator Organisms; Microbiological Quality; Total Coliforms; Escherichia Coli; River Pollution; Rivers; Fecal Coliform; Human Rights; Indicator Organisms; Microbial Contamination; Microbiological Quality; Safe Drinking Water; Tap Water; Total Coliforms; Typhoid Fever; Water-borne Disease; Waste Disposal; Drinking Water; Flooding; Manufacturing; Microbial Activity; Water Quality; Accra; Ghana; Greater Accra,Escherichia coli; River pollution; Rivers; Fecal Coliform; Human rights; Indicator organisms; Microbial contamination; Microbiological quality; Safe drinking water; Tap water; Total coliforms; Typhoid fever; Water-borne disease; Waste disposal; drinking water; flooding; manufacturing; microbial activity; water quality; Accra; Ghana; Greater Accra,,IWA Publishing,24089354; 20402244,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214977056

For this, different physicochemical and microbiological parameters were analyzed, and the results were evaluated according to the guidelines established by the WHO (2011) and the National Standards for Drinking Water Quality (NSDWQ) (2008). With the exception of sulphate, all physicochemical parameters were well within the guideline values. The mean concentrations of the metals in the samples were in the following order: Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Zn > Fe > Pb > Ni > Cr > As. More than 70% of the samples tested for Total Coliform Count (TCC), Total Faecal Coliform Count (TFC), Total Feacal Streptococci (TFS), and Total Aerobic Count (TAC) were feacal contaminated. E. coli was also isolated in almost 84.61% of the tested piped water samples. Results from the WQI revealed that 95.6% of samples had good physico-chemical characteristics, and 26% of the piped water samples had good microbiological quality. The WQI readings of all the samples for metals showed that they were unfit for human consumption. The mean Chronic Daily Intake (CDI) and Hazard Quotient (HQ) values, respectively, were in the following order: Zn > Fe > Pb > Ni > Cr > As, and Pb > As > Ni > Cr > Zn > Fe. All HQ values for As and Pb were greater than 1, and 50% of piped water samples had an HQ value for Ni that was greater than 1, indicating that people may suffer serious health issues as a result. All of the piped water samples except the area of block 13 D (S-5), had HQ values of less than 1 in relation to iron, but Zn HQ values of less than 1 indicated only mild health problems. Discharge of untreated sewage and cross-contamination are all potential sources of contamination that could result in diseases that are harmful to the public’s health. Water monitoring and management projects should be implemented in order to improve pipeline infrastructure and reduce sewage leakages.","Contamination; Karachi; Metals; Piped Water; Wqi; Arsenic; Cadmium; Calcium; Calcium Ion; Cobalt; Iron; Lead; Magnesium; Water; Zinc; Drinking Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Hanna Potable Ph Meter; Merck Spectroquant Nova-60; Statistica Version 10; Diagnosis; Failure Analysis; Fault Tolerance; Fluoridation; Medical Problems; Mineral Springs; Negative Bias Temperature Instability; Nickel; Outages; Reliability Analysis; Reliability Theory; Software Reliability; Zinc; Hazard Quotients; Health Risk Assessments; Human Health Risk Assessment; Karachi; Micro-biological Parameters; Physico - Chemical Parameters; Piped Water; Water Quality Indexes; Water Samples; Water-supply Systems; Escherichia Coli; Arsenic; Cadmium; Calcium; Calcium Ion; Cobalt; Heavy Metal; Iron; Lead; Magnesium; Water; Zinc; Drinking Water; Health Risk; Parameterization; Physicochemical Property; Risk Assessment; Water Quality; Water Supply; Article; Bacterium Contamination; Biofilm; Body Weight; Contamination; Hardness; Health Hazard; Health Risk Assessment; Human; Microbiological Parameters; Ph; Phylogenetic Tree; Piped Water Supply System; Pollution; Streptococcaceae; Water Contamination; Water Management; Chemistry; Environmental Monitoring; Microbiology; Pakistan; Procedures; Water Pollutant; Sind; Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Risk Assessment; Water Microbiology; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality; Water Supply","Diagnosis; Failure analysis; Fault tolerance; Fluoridation; Medical problems; Mineral springs; Negative bias temperature instability; Nickel; Outages; Reliability analysis; Reliability theory; Software reliability; Zinc; Hazard quotients; Health risk assessments; Human health risk assessment; Karachi; Micro-biological parameters; Physico - chemical parameters; Piped water; Water quality indexes; Water samples; Water-supply systems; Escherichia coli; arsenic; cadmium; calcium; calcium ion; cobalt; heavy metal; iron; lead; magnesium; water; zinc; drinking water; health risk; parameterization; physicochemical property; risk assessment; water quality; water supply; Article; bacterium contamination; biofilm; body weight; contamination; hardness; health hazard; health risk assessment; human; microbiological parameters; pH; phylogenetic tree; piped water supply system; pollution; Streptococcaceae; water contamination; water management; chemistry; environmental monitoring; microbiology; Pakistan; procedures; water pollutant; Sind; Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Risk Assessment; Water Microbiology; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality; Water Supply",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,15732959; 01676369,,EMASD,39495336,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85208494012

Moreover, microbial resistance is one of the most prevalent global problems that extends the need for self-medication and the healing period, or it may be linked to treatment failure that results in further hospitalization, higher healthcare expenses, and higher mortality rates. Thus, innovative synthesis of new antimicrobial materials is required to preserve the environment and enhance human health. Results: The present study highlighted a simple and cost-effective approach to biosynthesize a chitosan/graphene oxide/zinc oxide nanocomposite (CS/GO/ZnO) alone and immobilized in a macroporous cryogel as a new antimicrobial agent. Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 was used as a safe and efficient bio-nano-factory during biosynthesis. The formation of CS/GO/ZnO was confirmed and characterized using different analyses including ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), selective area diffraction pattern (SADP), Zeta analyses, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). GO combined with ZnO NPs successfully and displayed an adsorption peak at 358 nm. The XRD results showed the crystalline composition of the loaded ZnO NPs on GO sheets. FTIR spectrum confirmed the presence of proteins during the synthesis which act as stabilizing and capping agents. The nanocomposite has a high negative surface charge (-32.8 ± 5.7 mV) which increases its stability. SEM and TEM showing the size of biosynthesized ZnO-NPs was in the range of 40–50 nm. The CS/GO/ZnO alone or immobilized in cryogel revealed good antimicrobial activities against B. cereus ATCC 14,579, Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922, and Candida albicans ATCC 10,231 in a dose-dependent manner. The CS/GO/ZnO cryogel revealed higher antimicrobial activity than GO/ZnO nanocomposite and standard antibiotics (amoxicillin and miconazole) with inhibition zones averages of 24.33 ± 0.12, 15.67 ± 0.03, and 17.5 ± 0.49 mm, respectively. The MIC values of the prepared nanocomposite against B. cereus, E. coli, and C. albicans were 80, 80, and 90 µg/ml compared to standard drugs (90, 120 and 150 µg/ml, respectively). According to the TEM ultrastructure studies of nanocomposite-treated microbes, treated cells had severe deformities and morphological alterations compared to the untreated cells including cell wall distortion, the separation between the cell wall and plasma membrane, vacuoles formation moreover complete cell lyses were also noted. In the cytotoxicity test of CS/GO/ZnO alone and its cryogel, there was a significant reduction (p˂0.05) in cell viability of WI-38 normal lung cell line after the concentration of 209 and 164 µg/ml, respectively. It showed the low toxic effect of the nanocomposite and its cryogel on the WI-38 line which implies its safety. In addition, water treatment with the CS/GO/ZnO cryogel decreased turbidity (0.58 NTU), total coliform (2 CFU/100 ml), fecal coliform (1 CFU/100 ml), fecal Streptococcus (2 CFU/100 ml), and heterotrophic plate counts (53 CFU/1 ml) not only in comparison with the chlorine-treated samples (1.69 NTU, 4 CFU/100 ml, 6 CFU/100 ml, 57 CFU/100 ml, and 140 CFU/1 ml, respectively) but also with the raw water samples (6.9 NTU, 10800 CFU/100 ml, 660 CFU/100 ml, 800 CFU/100 ml, and 4400 CFU/1 ml, respectively). Moreover, cryogel significantly decreased the concentration of different heavy metals, especially cobalt compared to chlorine (0.004 ppm, 0.002 ppm, and 0.001 ppm for raw water, chlorine-treated, and cryogel-treated groups, respectively) which helped in the reduction of their toxic effects. Conclusion: This study provides an effective, promising, safe, and alternative nanocomposite to treat different human and animal pathogenic microbes that might be used in different environmental, industrial, and medical applications.","Antimicrobial; Bacillus Subtilis; Chitosan; Cryogel; Graphene Oxide; Nanocomposite; Water Treatment; Zinc Oxide; Amoxicillin; Chitosan; Chlorine; Cobalt; Miconazole; Water; Zinc Oxide; Graphite; Anti-bacterial Agents; Anti-infective Agents; Chitosan; Cryogels; Graphene Oxide; Graphite; Metals, Heavy; Zinc Oxide; Amoxicillin; Chitosan; Chitosan Graphene Oxide Zinc Oxide Nanocomposite; Chlorine; Cobalt; Cryogel; Graphene Oxide; Heavy Metal; Miconazole; Nanocomposite; Stabilizing Agent; Unclassified Drug; Water; Zinc Oxide; Zinc Oxide Nanocomposite; Zinc Oxide Nanoparticle; Antiinfective Agent; Graphite; Adsorption; Antimicrobial Activity; Article; Bacillus Subtilis; Bacillus Subtilis Atcc 6633; Bioremediation; Biosynthesis; Candida Albicans; Cell Membrane; Cell Structure; Cell Vacuole; Cell Viability; Cell Wall; Coliform Bacterium; Colony Forming Unit; Controlled Study; Crystal Structure; Cytotoxicity Test; Dose Response; Drug Concentration; Drug Safety; Drug Synthesis; Escherichia Coli; Fecal Coliform; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Heterotrophy; Human; Human Cell; Immobilization; Minimum Inhibitory Concentration; Nonhuman; Particle Size; Plate Count; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Streptococcus; Surface Charge; Transmission Electron Microscopy; Turbidity; Ultrastructure; Ultraviolet Visible Spectroscopy; Water Treatment; Wi-38 Cell Line; X Ray Diffraction; Zone Of Inhibition; Chemistry; Drug Effect; Metabolism; Microbial Sensitivity Test; Anti-bacterial Agents; Anti-infective Agents; Chitosan; Cryogels; Graphite; Metals, Heavy; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Nanocomposites; Zinc Oxide","amoxicillin; chitosan; chitosan graphene oxide zinc oxide nanocomposite; chlorine; cobalt; cryogel; graphene oxide; heavy metal; miconazole; nanocomposite; stabilizing agent; unclassified drug; water; zinc oxide; zinc oxide nanocomposite; zinc oxide nanoparticle; antiinfective agent; graphite; adsorption; antimicrobial activity; Article; Bacillus subtilis; Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633; bioremediation; biosynthesis; Candida albicans; cell membrane; cell structure; cell vacuole; cell viability; cell wall; coliform bacterium; colony forming unit; controlled study; crystal structure; cytotoxicity test; dose response; drug concentration; drug safety; drug synthesis; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; heterotrophy; human; human cell; immobilization; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; particle size; plate count; scanning electron microscopy; Streptococcus; surface charge; transmission electron microscopy; turbidity; ultrastructure; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; water treatment; WI-38 cell line; X ray diffraction; zone of inhibition; chemistry; drug effect; metabolism; microbial sensitivity test; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Infective Agents; Chitosan; Cryogels; Graphite; Metals, Heavy; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Nanocomposites; Zinc Oxide",,BioMed Central Ltd,14752859,,MCFIC,39402571,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206279660

Methods: A total of 42 water samples were collected using sterile glass bottles from three different river sites: Damota (upstream), Kera (midstream), and Gututo (downstream). All the water samples were examined for the presence of heterotrophic bacteria, total coliform and fecal coliform using direct plate count method and membrane filtration method. Standard methods suggested by American water works association were used to analysis the physicochemical parameters of the water samples. Results: The results revealed that the total heterotrophic bacteria, total coliform, and fecal coliform count ranged from 8.9 to 12.6 × 104 cfu/ml, 7.5–11.3 × 102 cfu/ml and 5.7–9.7 × 104 cfu/ml, respectively. The bacterial count results indicated that the river water crossed the WHO-recommended limit of potable water.

In Colombia, people use groundwater as drinking water without additional treatment. In addition, there is no infrastructure for wastewater collection and sewage treatment in the region of the Middle Magdalena Valley. The current study aims to evaluate the quality of groundwater in this region to determine any potential health hazards associated with its consumption. To reach the objective, three (3) physicochemical and microbiological sampling campaigns were carried out during different hydrological periods. A total of 428 groundwater samples were analyzed for over 28 parameters. The results were compared with the water quality standards proposed by the US EPA and Colombian regulations for human consumption. The analysis revealed the presence of total and fecal coliforms in 89% and 58% of the analyzed samples, respectively, identifying them as the main contaminants in groundwater. Furthermore, the pH levels did not meet the standards set by the US EPA in 33.8% of the cases and by Colombian regulations in 31.02%. Additionally, 32.8%, 17.6%, 14.3%, and 10.9% of the samples failed to meet the established thresholds for apparent color, magnesium, iron, and nitrates, respectively, under both standards. Moreover, only the analyses of selenium, mercury, and zinc complied with the quality standards under both regulatory frameworks. Based on the Colombian Drinking-Water Quality Risk Index (CDWQRI-IRCA), the risk associated with water quality meant for human consumption was assessed. The results showed that over 84% of the samples analyzed posed a high risk to human health, 4.6% posed a medium risk, 5.5% posed a low risk, and only 5.7% posed no risk at all. Additionally, official mortality statistics for children under four years old were reviewed, which revealed two deaths in 2019 due to Acute Diarrheal Disease (ADD) caused by consumption of contaminated water. Therefore, it is crucial to implement water treatment systems, establish aqueducts in rural areas, and conduct rigorous and systematic monitoring of drinking water to ensure it is safe for human consumption. It is also important to track morbidity and mortality rates associated with water consumption.","Drinking Water; Ground Water; Colombia; Environmental Monitoring; Human; Microbiology; Procedures; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutant; Water Quality; Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Humans; Risk Assessment; Water Microbiology; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality","drinking water; ground water; Colombia; environmental monitoring; human; microbiology; procedures; risk assessment; water pollutant; water quality; Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Humans; Risk Assessment; Water Microbiology; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality",,Nature Research,20452322,,,38762566,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85193528460

Pathogenic strains of such microbes have evolved to cause diarrhea, urinary tract infections, and septicemias. The emergence of antibiotic resistance urged the identification of an alternative strategy. The use of lytic bacteriophages against the control of pathogenic E. coli in clinics and different environmental setups (waste and drink water management) has become an alternative therapy to antibiotic therapy. Thus, this study aimed to isolate and characterize lytic bacteriophage from various sources in Addis Ababa, tested them against antimicrobial-resistant diarrheagenic E. coli strains and evaluated their therapeutic potential under in vitro conditions. Methods: A total of 14 samples were processed against six different diarrheagenic E. coli strains. The conventional culture and plaque analysis agar overlay method was used to recover lytic bacteriophage isolates. The phage isolates were characterized to determine their lytic effect, growth characteristics, host range activity, and stability under different temperature and pH conditions. Phage isolates were identified by scanning electron microscope (SEM), and molecular techniques (PCR). Results: In total, 17 phages were recovered from 84 tested plates. Of the 17 phage isolates, 11 (65%) were Myoviridae-like phages, and 6 (35%) phage isolates were Podoviridae and Siphoviridae by morphology and PCR identification. Based on the host range test, growth characteristics, and stability test 7 potent phages were selected. These phages demonstrated better growth characteristics, including short latent periods, highest burst sizes, and wider host ranges, as well as thermal stability and the ability to survive in a wide range of pH levels. Conclusions: The promising effect of the phages isolated in this study against AMR pathogenic E. coli has raised the possibility of their use in the future treatment of E. coli infections.",Diarrheagenic E.

Earlier studies have shown a substantial reduction in the incidence of diarrheal disease over a period of one year using a polysulfone membrane water gravity-powered water filtration device. The current report is a continuation of these studies to assess the long-term effects of the innovative method on diarrheal incidence rates over a 4-year follow-up period. This follow-up study monitored the trend of self-reported diarrheal events in all households in the previously studied villages for 5 months, in the last half of each study year, using the same questionnaire utilized in the earlier study. Three villages that had no device yet installed served as controls. We computed monthly diarrheal incidence rates for all study years (standardized to per 100 person-months) and compared these to the pre-device incidence rate in 2018 and in the control group, using the Wilcoxon rank sum exact test. The average diarrheal incidence rates of 1.5 p100pm in 2019, 2.19 p100pm in 2021, and 0.54p100pm in 2022 were significantly different from an earlier study that reported 17.8 p100pm rates before the devices were installed in 2018, (all p-values < 0.05). Concomitantly, self-reported diarrheal infections were substantially higher in the “control villages” not yet having the filtration device installed (80.9, 77.6, and 21.5 per 100 pm). The consistent and large reduction in diarrhea incidence documents the long-term efficacy of the use of the membrane filtration device. This simple water purification method using gravity flow improves public health in remote regions with limited resources.",E.

However, with the emergence of large-scale epidemic diseases such as SARS, avian influenza and COVID-19 in recent years, people are increasingly concerned about the public health safety of reclaimed water discharged into landscape water, especially the pathogenic microorganisms in it. In this study, the water quality and microorganisms of the Old Summer Palace, a landscape water body with reclaimed water as the only replenishment water source, were tracked through long-term dynamic monitoring. And the health risks of indicator microorganisms were analyzed using Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA). It was found that the concentration of indicator microorganisms Enterococcus (ENT), Escherichia coli (EC) and Fecal coliform (FC) generally showed an upward trend along the direction of water flow and increased by more than 0.6 log at the end of the flow. The concentrations of indicator microorganisms were higher in summer and autumn than those in spring. And there was a positive correlation between the concentration of indicator microorganisms and COD. Further research suggested that increased concentration of indicator microorganisms also led to increased health risks, which were more than 30% higher in other areas of the park than the water inlet area and required special attention. In addition, (water) surface operation exposure pathway had much higher health risks than other pathways and people in related occupations were advised to take precautions to reduce the risks.",Health Risk; Indicator Microorganisms; Landscape Water; Pearson Correlation Analysis; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (qmra); Reclaimed Water; Redundancy Analysis; The Old Summer Palace; Atmospheric Temperature; Correlation Methods; Escherichia Coli; Flow Of Water; Risk Assessment; Water Quality; Water Supply; Indicator Microorganism; Landscape Waters; Large-scales; Pearson Correlation Analysis; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment; Re-claimed Water; Redundancy Analysis; The Old Summer Palace; Water Shortages; Health Risks; Correlation; Health Risk; Microorganism; Quantitative Analysis; Risk Assessment; Water Quality; Enterococcus; Environmental Monitoring; Human; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Water Supply; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Risk Assessment; Water Microbiology; Water Quality; Water Supply,Atmospheric temperature; Correlation methods; Escherichia coli; Flow of water; Risk assessment; Water quality; Water supply; Indicator microorganism; Landscape waters; Large-scales; Pearson correlation analysis; Quantitative microbial risk assessment; Re-claimed water; Redundancy analysis; The old summer palace; Water shortages; Health risks; correlation; health risk; microorganism; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; water quality; Enterococcus; environmental monitoring; human; isolation and purification; microbiology; water supply; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Risk Assessment; Water Microbiology; Water Quality; Water Supply,,Chinese Academy of Sciences,10010742; 18787320,,,38969447,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85181803535

The growing use of molecular techniques for environmental monitoring allows for the rapid detection of pathogenic genes, thus providing more accurate information regarding the health risk of exposure to contaminated sand. The aim of this work was to determine the relationship between the fecal indicators abundance in water and sand and the presence of Shiga toxin-producer Escherichia coli (STEC) in sand by analyzing samples from touristic beaches using culture-dependent (fecal coliforms assay) and culture-independent (real-time PCR of stx1, stx2, and eae genes) techniques. We found a high concentration of coliform bacteria in water and sand in several beaches in eastern Uruguay, with different levels of sanitation networks and levels of urbanization. The presence of STEC virulence genes (mainly stx1) was confirmed in 8 out of 20 sand samples. The recreational use of sandy beaches may imply a risk to the health of its users, especially near streams and creek outflows, thus highlighting the need of monitoring sand bacteriological quality and pathogens using molecular tools.",Beaches; Fecal Contamination; Real-time Pcr; Sand Monitoring; Shiga Toxin-producing Escherichia Coli; Chlorophyll; Water; Sand; 6000 Corbett Rotor-gene 6000 Instrument; Orion Star A325; Power Sybr Green Pcr Kit; Rotor-gene6000 Software 1.7; Zr Soil Microbe Dna Miniprep Laboratory Kit; Diseases; River Pollution; Fecal Contamination; Fecal Indicators; Infectious Disease; Pathogenics; Real-time Pcr; Recreational Beaches; Risk Of Exposures; Sand Monitoring; Shiga Toxin; Shiga Toxin-producing Escherichia Coli; Escherichia Coli; Chlorophyll; Virulence Factor; Water; Health Risk; Pathogenicity; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Recreational Facility; Sand Wave; Soil Pollution; Water Management; Accessory Gene; Article; Bacterial Growth; Bacterial Load; Bacterium Culture; Bacterium Detection; Bacterium Identification; Bioassay; Coliform Bacterium; Colony Forming Unit; Dna Extraction; Dna Isolation; Eae Gene; Environmental Monitoring; Fecal Coliforms Assay; Fecal Indicator Abundance; Gene; Gene Dosage; Geographic Distribution; Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome; Human; Limit Of Detection; Listeria Monocytogenes; Microbial Diversity; Molecular Evolution; Nonhuman; Population Abundance; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sand; Sea Surface Temperature; Seashore; Sewage; Shiga Toxin Producing Escherichia Coli; Solar Radiation; Stx1 Gene; Stx2 Gene; Urbanization; Water Sampling; Feces; Genetics; Microbiology; Procedures; Swimming; Uruguay; Bathing Beaches; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Sand; Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia Coli; Water Microbiology,Diseases; River pollution; Fecal contamination; Fecal indicators; Infectious disease; Pathogenics; Real-time PCR; Recreational beaches; Risk of exposures; Sand monitoring; Shiga toxin; Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli; chlorophyll; virulence factor; water; health risk; pathogenicity; polymerase chain reaction; recreational facility; sand wave; soil pollution; water management; accessory gene; Article; bacterial growth; bacterial load; bacterium culture; bacterium detection; bacterium identification; bioassay; coliform bacterium; colony forming unit; DNA extraction; DNA isolation; eae gene; environmental monitoring; fecal coliforms assay; fecal indicator abundance; gene; gene dosage; geographic distribution; hemolytic uremic syndrome; human; limit of detection; Listeria monocytogenes; microbial diversity; molecular evolution; nonhuman; population abundance; real time polymerase chain reaction; sand; sea surface temperature; seashore; sewage; Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli; solar radiation; stx1 gene; stx2 gene; urbanization; water sampling; feces; genetics; microbiology; procedures; swimming; Uruguay; Bathing Beaches; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Sand; Shiga-Toxigenic Escherichia coli; Water Microbiology,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,15732959; 01676369,,EMASD,39419901,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206847378

This study aimed to optimize a prediction model for estimating COVID-19 infection rates based on SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater, and reveal the infection trends and variant diversification in Shenzhen, China following the lifting of a strict COVID-19 strategy. Faecal samples (n = 4337) from 1204 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals hospitalized in a designated hospital were analysed to obtain Omicron variant-specific faecal shedding dynamics. Wastewater samples from 6 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and 9 pump stations, covering 3.55 million people, were monitored for SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations and variant abundance. We found that the viral load in wastewater increased rapidly in December 2022 in the two districts, demonstrating a sharp peak in COVID-19 infections in late-December 2022, mainly caused by Omicron subvariants BA.5.2.48 and BF.7.14. The prediction model, based on the mass balance between total viral load in wastewater and individual faecal viral shedding, revealed a surge in the cumulative infection rate from <0.1 % to over 70 % within three weeks after the strict COVID-19 strategy was lifted. Additionally, 39 cryptic SARS-CoV-2 variants were identified in wastewater, in addition to those detected through clinical surveillance. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of WBE in providing comprehensive and efficient assessments of COVID-19 infection rates and identifying cryptic variants, highlighting its potential for monitoring emerging pathogens with faecal shedding.","Cryptic Sars-cov-2 Variant; Faecal Viral Shedding; Infection Rate; Sars-cov-2 Omicron Variant; Wastewater Surveillance; Rna, Viral; Wastewater; 2019-ncov Nucleic Acid Detection Kit; Abi Prism 7500 Real-time Pcr Instrument; Graphpad Prism V8.4.0; Miniseq Sequencing Platform; Nexteraxt Dna Library Preparation Kit; Sorvall Lynx 4000 Superspeed Centrifuge; Ulsen Ultra-sensitive Novel Coronavirus Whole-genome Capture Kit; Covid-19; Rna; Wastewater Treatment; Cryptic Sars-cov-2 Variant; Faecal Samples; Fecal Viral Shedding; Infection Rates; Prediction Modelling; Rna Concentration; Sars-cov-2 Omicron Variant; Viral Load; Wastewater Samples; Wastewater Surveillance; Coronavirus; Epidemiology; Health Monitoring; Infectious Disease; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Wastewater Treatment Plant; Article; Centrifugation; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Flow Rate; Human; Limit Of Detection; Major Clinical Study; Nucleic Acid Analysis; Oropharyngeal Swab; Quality Control; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rna Extraction; Sars-cov-2 Omicron; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Vaccination; Waste Water Treatment Plant; Wastewater-based Epidemiology; Betacoronavirus; China; Feces; Pandemic; Virology; Virus Load; Virus Shedding; Wastewater; Guangdong; Shenzhen; Virus Rna; Feces; Humans; Pandemics; Rna, Viral; Sars-cov-2; Sars-cov-2 Variants; Viral Load; Virus Shedding; Wastewater; Wastewater-based Epidemiological Monitoring","COVID-19; RNA; Wastewater treatment; Cryptic SARS-CoV-2 variant; Faecal samples; Fecal viral shedding; Infection rates; Prediction modelling; RNA concentration; SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant; Viral load; Wastewater samples; Wastewater surveillance; Coronavirus; epidemiology; health monitoring; infectious disease; severe acute respiratory syndrome; wastewater treatment plant; Article; centrifugation; coronavirus disease 2019; flow rate; human; limit of detection; major clinical study; nucleic acid analysis; oropharyngeal swab; quality control; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; waste water treatment plant; wastewater-based epidemiology; Betacoronavirus; China; feces; pandemic; virology; virus load; virus shedding; wastewater; Guangdong; Shenzhen; virus RNA; Feces; Humans; Pandemics; RNA, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2 variants; Viral Load; Virus Shedding; Wastewater; Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,39102947,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85200259089

In this study, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed to evaluate the presence of human fecal viral indicators and viral pathogens in urban wastewater (n = 13) and groundwater (n = 12) samples from four locations in Barcelona with different degrees of urbanization, as well as in runoff samples (n = 2). Additionally, a target enrichment sequencing (TES) approach was utilized to explore the viral diversity within groundwater and runoff samples, offering insights into viral contamination and potential virus transmission routes in urban areas. Human adenovirus (HAdV) was identified in all wastewater samples, 67 % (8/12) of groundwater samples, and one runoff sample by qPCR indicating human viral fecal contamination. The viral pathogen Norovirus genogroup GI (NoV GI) was detected in wastewater and two winter groundwater samples from highly and medium urbanized areas. NoV genogroup GII (NoV GII), Enterovirus (EV) and SARS-CoV-2 were exclusively detected in wastewater. Human and other vertebrate viruses were detected in groundwater and runoff samples using TES.

The collected water samples were analyzed for physicochemical and biological qualities and trace and heavy metal contents. Chronic daily intake (CDI) and hazard quotient (HQ) indices were calculated to assess human health risks associated with heavy metal exposure. The groundwater pollution index (GPI) showed that 100% of the water samples were very highly polluted (GPI .2.5). The HQ values for both children and adults were less than 1. All samples’ total coliform and fecal coliform counts surpassed the recommended limit of 0 cfu/100 mL. The water sources of the study sites were not deemed suitable for drinking as most of the water quality parameters did not meet the national and international drinking water quality standards.

Pathogenic strains of E. coli pose a significant public health risk. Despite China's rapid economic and social development, sanitation and watershed management still face challenges. In this study, we employ a combined model of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool and Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment to predict pollution changes, considering social development and climate change. Our aim is to quantify the risks and assess pollution prevention strategies for E. coli in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region. The results indicated that under moderate development, the average E. coli concentrations and disease burdens were 367 ± 75 CFU/100 mL and 23.4 (95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 2.8–72.6) Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs, per 1,000,000 population per year), respectively. Under rapid development, these values were 330 ± 58 CFU/100 mL and 21.2 (95 % CI: 2.6–65.1) DALYs, respectively. Implementing a point strategy, mainly increasing sewage collection rates, could reduce E. coli concentrations by approximately 30 % and disease burdens by 27–28 %. For a diffuse strategy, primarily extending composting duration, reductions of 9 % in E. coli concentrations and 7–8 % in disease burdens were observed. Combining both strategies resulted in a 40 % decrease in E. coli concentrations and 35–36 % reduction in disease burdens. This model, incorporating social development, climate change, and microbial risk, provides insights into predicting pollution changes and evaluating the effectiveness of prevention strategies for E. coli in the TGR region and similar watersheds.",Escherichia Coli; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment; Soil And Water Assessment Tool; Three Gorges Reservoir Region; Watershed Management; Climate Change; Climate Models; Economic And Social Effects; Effluents; Health Risks; Reservoir Management; Reservoirs (water); Risk Analysis; Risk Assessment; River Pollution; Rivers; Sewage; Soil Conservation; Water Conservation; Water Management; Watersheds; % Reductions; Confidence Interval; Disease Burdens; Health Risk Analysis; Prevention Strategies; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment; Social Development; Soil And Water Assessment Tools; Three Gorges Reservoir Region; Watersheds Management; Escherichia Coli; Coliform Bacterium; Concentration (composition); Health Risk; Quantitative Analysis; Soil And Water Assessment Tool; Watershed; China; Chongqing; Three Gorges Reservoir,Climate change; Climate models; Economic and social effects; Effluents; Health risks; Reservoir management; Reservoirs (water); Risk analysis; Risk assessment; River pollution; Rivers; Sewage; Soil conservation; Water conservation; Water management; Watersheds; % reductions; Confidence interval; Disease burdens; Health risk analysis; Prevention strategies; Quantitative microbial risk assessment; Social development; Soil and Water assessment tools; Three Gorges Reservoir region; Watersheds management; Escherichia coli; coliform bacterium; concentration (composition); health risk; quantitative analysis; soil and water assessment tool; watershed; China; Chongqing; Three Gorges Reservoir,,Elsevier B.V.,00221694,,JHYDA,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196958482

We compared the use of Bacteroides-based exposure assessment to exposure assessment that relied on pathogen measurements. We considered two types of recreational water sites: those impacted by combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and those not impacted by CSOs. Samples from CSO-impacted and non-CSO-impacted urban creeks were analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for HF183 Bacteroides and eight human gastrointestinal pathogens. Exposure assessment was conducted two ways for each type of site (CSO-impacted vs. non-CSO impacted): 1) by estimating pathogen concentrations from HF183 Bacteroides concentrations using published ratios of HF183 to pathogens in sewage and 2) by estimating pathogen concentrations from qPCR measurements. QMRA (quantitative microbial risk assessment) was then conducted for swimming, wading, and fishing exposures. Overall, mean risk estimates varied from 0.27 to 53 illnesses per 1,000 recreators depending on exposure assessment, site, activity, and norovirus dose-response model. HF183-based exposure assessment identified CSO-impacted sites as higher risk, and the recommended HF183 risk-based threshold of 525 genomic copies per 100 mL was generally protective of public health at the CSO-impacted sites but was not as protective at the non-CSO-impacted sites. In the context of our urban watershed, HF183-based exposure assessment over- and under-estimated risk relative to exposure assessment based on pathogen measurements, and the etiology of predicted pathogen-specific illnesses differed significantly. Across all sites, the HF183 model overestimated risk for norovirus, adenovirus, and Campylobacter jejuni, and it underestimated risk for E. coli and Cryptosporidium. To our knowledge, this study is the first to directly compare health risk estimates using HF183 and empirical pathogen measurements from the same waterways. Our work highlights the importance of site-specific hazard identification and exposure assessment to decide whether HF183 is applicable for monitoring risk.",Acute Gastrointestinal Illness (agi); Combined Sewer Overflows (csos); Hf183; Human Bacteroides; Pathogens; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (qmra); Recreation; Sewage; Escherichia Coli; Health Risks; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Risk Assessment; Risk Perception; Sewage; Urban Growth; Watersheds; Acute Gastrointestinal Illness; Bacteroides; Combined Sewer Overflow; Combined Sewer Overflows; Exposure Assessment; Gastrointestinal; Human Bacteroides; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment; Recreation; Pathogens; Health Risk; Pathogen; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Public Health; Adenoviridae; Article; Bacterial Strain; Campylobacter Jejuni; Coliform Bacterium; Colony Forming Unit; Concentration (parameter); Controlled Study; Cryptosporidium; Enterovirus; Fecal Coliform; Fishing; Genomics; Giardia Intestinalis; Indicator Organism; Infectious Agent; Intestine Flora; Microorganism Detection; Nonhuman; Norovirus; Pennsylvania; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Recreation; Risk Assessment; Salmonella; Sewage; Sewer; Swimming; Tcid50; Urban Area; Water Sampling; Water Standard; Watershed; City; Environmental Monitoring; Genetics; Human; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Procedures; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Risk Assessment; Water Microbiology,Escherichia coli; Health risks; Polymerase chain reaction; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sewage; Urban growth; Watersheds; Acute gastrointestinal illness; Bacteroides; Combined sewer overflow; Combined sewer overflows; Exposure assessment; Gastrointestinal; Human bacteroides; Quantitative microbial risk assessment; Recreation; Pathogens; health risk; pathogen; polymerase chain reaction; public health; Adenoviridae; Article; bacterial strain; Campylobacter jejuni; coliform bacterium; colony forming unit; concentration (parameter); controlled study; Cryptosporidium; Enterovirus; fecal coliform; fishing; genomics; Giardia intestinalis; indicator organism; infectious agent; intestine flora; microorganism detection; nonhuman; Norovirus; Pennsylvania; real time polymerase chain reaction; recreation; risk assessment; Salmonella; sewage; sewer; swimming; TCID50; urban area; water sampling; water standard; watershed; city; environmental monitoring; genetics; human; isolation and purification; microbiology; procedures; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Risk Assessment; Water Microbiology,,Elsevier Ltd,00431354; 18792448,,WATRA,38889662,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196325407

In Japan, many SWSSs operate without regulation under the Waterworks Law, yet there is limited investigation into microbial contamination and the associated health risks. In this study, the microbiological water quality of four SWSSs that utilize mountain streams as water sources and do not install water treatment facilities were monitored for over 2 years. In investigated SWSSs, the mean heterotrophic plate counts were below 350 CFU/mL, and the total bacterial loads (16S rDNA concentration) ranged from 4.71 to 5.35 log<inf>10</inf> copies/mL. The results also showed the consistent presence of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), i.e., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens, suggesting the potential of fecal pollution. E. coli was then utilized as an indicator to assess the health risk posed by E. coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter jejuni. The results indicated that the estimated mean annual risk of infection and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) exceeded acceptable levels in all SWSSs for the two reference pathogens. To ensure microbial water safety, implementing appropriate water treatment facilities with an estimated mean required reduction of 5–6 log<inf>10</inf> was necessary. This study highlighted the potential microbial contamination and health risk level in SWSSs that utilize mountain streams as water sources, even though the water sources were almost not affected by human activities. Furthermore, this study would also be helpful in supporting risk-based water management to ensure a safe water supply in SWSSs.",Fecal Indicator Bacteria; Health Risk; Microbiological Water Quality; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment; Small Water Supply Systems; Contamination; Escherichia Coli; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Risk Perception; Water Pollution; Water Quality; Water Supply; Water Supply Systems; Water Treatment; Faecal Indicator Bacteria; Microbial Contamination; Microbiological Water Quality; Mountains Streams; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment; Risks Management; Small Water Supply System; Water Source; Water Treatment Facilities; Water-supply Systems; Health Risks; Dna 16s; Fecal Coliform; Health Risk; Microbial Activity; Monitoring System; Quantitative Analysis; Risk Assessment; Stream; Water Quality; Water Supply; Water Treatment; Waterborne Disease; Article; Bacterial Load; Campylobacter Jejuni; Clostridium Perfringens; Colony Forming Unit; Disability-adjusted Life Year; Dose Response; Environmental Parameters; Exposure; Health Hazard; Heterotrophy; Infection Risk; Microbiological Parameters; Monte Carlo Method; Mountain; Nonhuman; Plate Count; Risk Management; Safety; Stream (river); Water Monitoring; Environmental Monitoring; Isolation And Purification; Japan; Microbiology; Procedures; Environmental Monitoring; Risk Management; Water Microbiology; Water Quality; Water Supply,Contamination; Escherichia coli; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Water pollution; Water quality; Water supply; Water supply systems; Water treatment; Faecal indicator bacteria; Microbial contamination; Microbiological water quality; Mountains streams; Quantitative microbial risk assessment; Risks management; Small water supply system; Water source; Water treatment facilities; Water-supply systems; Health risks; DNA 16S; fecal coliform; health risk; microbial activity; monitoring system; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; stream; water quality; water supply; water treatment; waterborne disease; Article; bacterial load; Campylobacter jejuni; Clostridium perfringens; colony forming unit; disability-adjusted life year; dose response; environmental parameters; exposure; health hazard; heterotrophy; infection risk; microbiological parameters; Monte Carlo method; mountain; nonhuman; plate count; risk management; safety; stream (river); water monitoring; environmental monitoring; isolation and purification; Japan; microbiology; procedures; Environmental Monitoring; Risk Management; Water Microbiology; Water Quality; Water Supply,,Springer,14321009; 0364152X,,EMNGD,38767663,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85193568247

The total viability, coliform, fecal coliform count, and heavy metal in muscle partially decreased at HGS 10 and HGS15 mL−1 than in the control group. Correspondingly, the highest positive effect on hemato-biochemical indices was noticed at levels HGS 10 and HGS15 mL−1. Fish noticed an improvement in immune and antioxidant indices compared to control groups partially at HGS 10 and HGS15 mL−1. Interestingly, fish cultured in rearing water with the mixture provided downregulated the related inflammatory genes (HSP70, TNF, IL-1β, and IL-8) partially at HGS15 mL−1. In vitro, the mixture showed positive efficiency as an antibacterial and partially antiparasitic at HGS 10 and HGS15 mL−1. This study proposes utilizing a mixture of (HGS) and (MgO-NPs) with optimum levels of 10–15 mL-1 in cultured water to improve water indices, growth, health status, and increased resistance of O. niloticus against bacterial and parasitic infection.",Bioremediation; Biosynthesis; Cichlids; Immune Modulation; Resistance To Infection; Alanine Aminotransferase; Alcohol; Alkaline Phosphatase; Amylase; Aspartate Aminotransferase; Catalase; Creatinine; Glutathione; Glutathione Peroxidase; Interleukin 8; Macrophage Inflammatory Protein 1alpha; Magnesium; Magnesium Oxide; Malonaldehyde; Nitrogen; Superoxide Dismutase; Water; Zinc; Magnesium Oxide; Plant Extracts; Escalab 250xi+ Instrument; Graphpad Prism Version 8.0.2; Jenway 6305; Jeol 1010; R Studio V.2023.12.1–402; R V. 4.3.2; Spss 25.0; X’pert Pro; Ysi Model 56 Oxygen Meter; Alanine Aminotransferase; Alcohol; Algal Extract; Alkaline Phosphatase; Amylase; Aspartate Aminotransferase; Catalase; Creatinine; Distilled Water; Glutathione; Glutathione Peroxidase; Heat Shock Protein 70; Interleukin 8; Macrophage Inflammatory Protein 1alpha; Magnesium; Magnesium Oxide; Malonaldehyde; Nanoparticle; Nitrogen; Rantes; Superoxide Dismutase; Tumor Necrosis Factor; Water; Zinc; Metal Nanoparticle; Plant Extract; Antioxidant; Bioremediation; Cichlid; Disease Resistance; Health Status; Immune Response; Oxide; Parasite Infestation; Seaweed; Water Quality; Analysis Of Variance; Article; Controlled Study; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry; Kolmogorov Smirnov Test; Mortality; Nonhuman; Post Hoc Analysis; Pseudomonas Fluorescens; Regression Analysis; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Scientific Literature; Statistical Analysis; Zeta Potential; Zone Of Inhibition; Aeromonas Hydrophila; Animal; Chemistry; Drug Effect; Drug Therapy; Fish Disease; Green Chemistry; Immunology; Microbiology; Sargassum; Animals; Cichlids; Disease Resistance; Fish Diseases; Green Chemistry Technology; Magnesium Oxide; Metal Nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Plant Extracts; Seaweed; Water Quality,alanine aminotransferase; alcohol; algal extract; alkaline phosphatase; amylase; aspartate aminotransferase; catalase; creatinine; distilled water; glutathione; glutathione peroxidase; heat shock protein 70; interleukin 8; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; magnesium; magnesium oxide; malonaldehyde; nanoparticle; nitrogen; RANTES; superoxide dismutase; tumor necrosis factor; water; zinc; metal nanoparticle; plant extract; antioxidant; bioremediation; cichlid; disease resistance; health status; immune response; oxide; parasite infestation; seaweed; water quality; analysis of variance; Article; controlled study; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Kolmogorov Smirnov test; mortality; nonhuman; post hoc analysis; Pseudomonas fluorescens; regression analysis; scanning electron microscopy; scientific literature; statistical analysis; zeta potential; zone of inhibition; Aeromonas hydrophila; animal; chemistry; drug effect; drug therapy; fish disease; green chemistry; immunology; microbiology; Sargassum; Animals; Cichlids; Disease Resistance; Fish Diseases; Green Chemistry Technology; Magnesium Oxide; Metal Nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Plant Extracts; Seaweed; Water Quality,,Academic Press,01476513; 10902414,,EESAD,38843743,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85195026618

Enterococci are regarded as more reliable and conservative indicators of pathogen inactivation than fecal coliforms, which are typically used as indicators of fecal pollution. Non-spore pathogenic bacteria may enter a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state during composting, leading to residual risk. The VBNC status of bacteria is related to their survival during composting. However, the survival mechanisms of enterococci during sludge composting remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the VBNC state of enterococci in different phases of simulated sludge composting and the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) during the composting process. This study is expected to provide a basis for subsequent exploration of possible methods to completely inactivate enterococci and reduce ARGs during sludge composting. Culturable enterococci were reduced in the thermophilic phase of sludge composting, but the proportion of VBNC subpopulation increased. It was reported for the first time that most VBNC enterococci were killed by extending the cooling phase of sludge compost, and by prolonging the cooling phase the types of ARG were reduced. However, there was a certain quantity (approximately 104/g dry weight) of culturable and VBNC enterococci in the compost products. In addition, MGEs and ARGs exist in both bacteria and compost products, leading to the risk of spreading antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance when sludge compost products are used.","Args; Compost; Enterococci; Mges; Sludge; Vbnc; Ampicillin; Chloramphenicol; Ciprofloxacin; Doxycycline; Erythromycin; Fosfomycin; Gatifloxacin; Levofloxacin; Minocycline; Nitrofurantoin; Norfloxacin; Rifampicin; Teicoplanin; Tetracycline; Vancomycin; Anti-bacterial Agents; Sewage; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Transmissions; Antibiotic Resistance Genes; Antibiotics Resistance; Compost; Compost Products; Enterococcus; Genetic Elements; Mobile Genetic Element; Sludge; Sludge Composting; Viable But Non-culturable; Composting; Ampicillin; Chloramphenicol; Ciprofloxacin; Doxycycline; Erythromycin; Fosfomycin; Gatifloxacin; Levofloxacin; Minocycline; Nitrofurantoin; Norfloxacin; Penicillin Derivative; Rifampicin; Teicoplanin; Tetracycline; Vancomycin; Antiinfective Agent; Antibiotic Resistance; Composting; Fecal Coliform; Pathogen; Sludge; Antibiotic Resistance Gene; Article; Bacterial Infection; Bacterial Transmission; Bacterium Culture; China; City; Compost; Controlled Study; Cooling; Correlation Coefficient; Dry Weight; Gene; Infection Risk; Microbial Community; Mobile Genetic Element; Nonhuman; Procedures Concerning Cells; Simulation; Thermophilic Bacterium; Viable But Non Culturable; Drug Effect; Genetics; Microbiology; Procedures; Sewage; Anti-bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Sewage; Soil Microbiology","Antibiotics; Bacteria; Transmissions; Antibiotic resistance genes; Antibiotics resistance; Compost; Compost products; Enterococcus; Genetic elements; Mobile genetic element; Sludge; Sludge composting; Viable but non-culturable; Composting; ampicillin; chloramphenicol; ciprofloxacin; doxycycline; erythromycin; fosfomycin; gatifloxacin; levofloxacin; minocycline; nitrofurantoin; norfloxacin; penicillin derivative; rifampicin; teicoplanin; tetracycline; vancomycin; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; composting; fecal coliform; pathogen; sludge; antibiotic resistance gene; Article; bacterial infection; bacterial transmission; bacterium culture; China; city; compost; controlled study; cooling; correlation coefficient; dry weight; gene; infection risk; microbial community; mobile genetic element; nonhuman; procedures concerning cells; simulation; thermophilic bacterium; viable but non culturable; drug effect; genetics; microbiology; procedures; sewage; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Sewage; Soil Microbiology",,Elsevier Ltd,0956053X; 18792456,3540592105; 0873392558,WAMAE,38703551,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192134949

This study critically evaluates the interlinkage between bacteriological water quality, i.e. faecal coliforms and diarrhoea cases for the three pre-pandemic years 2017, 2018 and 2019 based on multiple sources. With around 17% of households tap water connectivity as of August 2019, the majority of the Indian population depends on raw groundwater (GW) and surface water sources. For this, faecal coliform (FC) levels in surface and GW have been mapped at district levels using data from India’s National Water Quality Monitoring Programme. Health Management Information System’s data on diarrhoea have been used to understand the monthly and district-wise variation of diarrhoea. The trends of FC, diarrhoea inpatient cases, and diarrhoea inpatient rates have been discussed. The analysis showed issues associated with the reliability and usefulness of these datasets with 43% of total India districts with no reported FC values for the study period. This study reveals a clear gap in the interlinkage between diarrhoea and bacteriological water quality with the unavailability of granular water quality data as a major challenge.",Contamination; Diarrhoea; Drinking Water Quality; Faecal Coliform; Groundwater; Drinking Water; Drinking Water; Diarrheal Disease; Fecal Coliform; Groundwater; Mortality; Water Pollution; Water Quality; Aged; Article; Contamination; Diarrhea; Household; Human; India; Male; Nonhuman; Water Borne Disease; Water Monitoring; Water Supply; Enterobacteriaceae; Epidemiology; Feces; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Diarrhea; Drinking Water; Feces; Humans; Water Microbiology; Water Quality; Water Supply,drinking water; diarrheal disease; fecal coliform; groundwater; mortality; water pollution; water quality; aged; Article; contamination; diarrhea; household; human; India; male; nonhuman; water borne disease; water monitoring; water supply; Enterobacteriaceae; epidemiology; feces; isolation and purification; microbiology; Diarrhea; Drinking Water; Feces; Humans; Water Microbiology; Water Quality; Water Supply,,IWA Publishing,14778920; 19967829,,,38935461,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197175712

Herein, the distribution and spread risk of pathogen were assessed in excavated landfill scenario. The results show that landfill excavation will greatly increase the risk of environmental microbial contamination. The highest total concentration of culturable bacteria among landfill refuse, topsoil and plant leaves was found to be as high as 1010 CFU g−1. Total coliforms, Hemolytic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Enterococci, and Fecal coliforms were detected in the landfill surrounding environment. Notably, pathogens were more likely to adhere to plant leaves, making it an important source of secondary pathogens. The culturable bacteria concentration in the air samples differed with the landfill zone with different operation status, and the highest culturable bacteria concentration was found in the excavated area of the landfill (3.3 × 104 CFU m−3), which was the main source of bioaerosol release. The distribution of bioaerosols in the downwind outside of the landfill showed a tendency of increasing and then decreasing, and the highest concentration of bioaerosols outside of the landfill (6.56 × 104 CFU m−3) was significantly higher than that in the excavated area of the landfill.

Although municipal wastewater plants are important sources and sinks for potential pathogenic microorganisms, data on rural wastewater treatment processes are limited. The proximity of rural wastewater facilities to human settlements and the trend toward wastewater resourcing could pose risks to humans. Here, a typical village in southern China was selected to analyze potential pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater, sewage sludge, and aerosols during the collection, treatment, and discharge of domestic wastewater. The succession characteristics and concentration variations of potential pathogenic microorganisms throughout the wastewater treatment process were identified using high-throughput sequencing and culture methods. Bacteria-associated health risks in facility aerosols were estimated based on average daily dose rates from inhalation and dermal exposure. Lower amounts of pathogenic bacteria and pathogenic fungi were detected in the effluent of the 1-ton treatment scale and the 10-ton treatment scale facilities, compared to those in the influent. Pathogen effluent concentrations were significantly lower than influent concentrations after treatment in rural wastewater facilities. 16 and 29 potential pathogenic bacteria and fungi were detected in aerosols from wastewater treatment facilities, respectively. Furthermore, the potential pathogen concentrations were higher than those in the background air. Aerobic units are the main source of pathogen emissions from aerosols. There were 42 potential pathogenic bacteria and 34 potential pathogenic fungi in the sewage sludge. Biochemical units were the main source of potential pathogens in sewage sludge, and more potential airborne pathogens originated from wastewater. In rural wastewater resourcing processes with greater pollutant exposure, the effluent of rural wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs), downstream rivers, and facility aerosols, could be important potential sources of microbial risk. Inhalation is the main pathway of human exposure to airborne bacteria. Therefore, more attention should be focused on microbiological risk in rural wastewater treatment processes.",Bioaerosols; Exposure Risk; Potential Pathogens; Rural Wastewater; Sewage Sludge; Aerosols; Sewage; Wastewater; Bacteria; Effluent Treatment; Effluents; Fungi; Health Risks; Pathogens; Reclamation; Risk Assessment; Risk Perception; Sewage Pumping Plants; Sewage Sludge; Wastewater Treatment; Bioaerosols; Concentration Variation; Exposure Risk; Pathogenic Bacterium; Pathogenic Fungi; Pathogenic Microorganisms; Potential Pathogen; Rural Wastewater; Wastewater Facilities; Wastewater Treatment Process; Aerosols; Aerosol; Domestic Waste; Health Risk; Microorganism; Pathogen; Pollution Exposure; Public Health; Risk Assessment; Sewage; Sludge; Source Identification; Wastewater Treatment; Airborne Bacterium; Article; Bacterium Culture; Chemical Analysis; Effluent; Enterobacteriaceae; Exploratory Behavior; Fecal Coliform; Health Hazard; High Throughput Sequencing; Infectious Agent; Inhalation; Irrigation (agriculture); Microbial Community; Nonhuman; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas Aeruginosa; Residential Area; Rural Area; Waste Water Management; Wastewater; Water Supply; Bacterium; Fungus; Human; Microbiology; Water Management; China; Air Microbiology; Humans; Risk Assessment; Sewage; Wastewater; Water Purification,Bacteria; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Fungi; Health risks; Pathogens; Reclamation; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage sludge; Wastewater treatment; Bioaerosols; Concentration variation; Exposure risk; Pathogenic bacterium; Pathogenic fungi; Pathogenic microorganisms; Potential pathogen; Rural wastewater; Wastewater facilities; Wastewater treatment process; Aerosols; aerosol; domestic waste; health risk; microorganism; pathogen; pollution exposure; public health; risk assessment; sewage; sludge; source identification; wastewater treatment; airborne bacterium; Article; bacterium culture; chemical analysis; effluent; Enterobacteriaceae; exploratory behavior; fecal coliform; health hazard; high throughput sequencing; infectious agent; inhalation; irrigation (agriculture); microbial community; nonhuman; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; residential area; rural area; waste water management; wastewater; water supply; bacterium; fungus; human; microbiology; water management; China; Air Microbiology; Humans; Risk Assessment; Sewage; Wastewater; Water Purification,,Elsevier Ltd,00431354; 18792448,,WATRA,38428237,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85186269556

This could lead to a higher risk of ingestion of microorganisms exhibiting resistance to antibiotics. Thus, this study focused on detecting fecal coliforms – specifically Escherichia coli – from artesian well water samples from selected barangays (Bayog, Malinta, and Mayondon) in Los Baños, Laguna, the Philippines. Isolated E. coli were screened for antimicrobial resistance. Out of 30 water samples, eight were presumptively positive for coliforms, as determined using the multiple-tube fermentation method. Three out of eight samples (MY2-2, ML2-3, and ML2-4) obtained E. coli isolates, as identified through phenotypic and molecular characterization. Using disk diffusion assay, resistance patterns were identified in the isolates for antibiotics cefoperazone, meropenem, ofloxacin, and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. Results revealed that MY2-2 was resistant to cefoperazone, meropenem, and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole; ML2-3 was resistant to cefoperazone and meropenem, whereas ML2-4 was resistant to all four antibiotics. Polymerase chain reaction with primers detecting the TEM gene, which is a type of extended-spectrum β-lactamase gene, showed that the isolates were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin. Results of phenotypic and molecular methods indicate that the isolates are multi-drug resistant. Based on household interviews, the artesian well water from which MY2-2 was isolated, was used for drinking by 10 households. Therefore, the local government units should regularly monitor artesian well water for microbiological quality, conduct education and information campaigns on the diseases that can be contracted from consuming unclean water, and ensure that potable water is accessible, especially for households with no access to purified water.",Antibiotic-resistant Escherichia Coli; Artesian Well Water,,,Department of Science and Technology,00317683,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197914229

The efficacy of routinely assayed water quality parameters was assessed as an alternative or complement to fecal nucleic acid viral indicator data for their utility in adjusting measured SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations to improve the relationship between wastewater molecular data and clinical COVID-19 case data. This research covers two study designs: grab samples collected from sewers serving The Ohio State University campus and composite influent samples collected at five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across the state of Ohio. Weekly mandatory clinical testing was used to monitor infections in the student population, and statewide cases were reported through voluntary clinical testing. Statewide WWTP results showed significant strong correlation between SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in the wastewater and confirmed COVID-19 cases, and correlation increased when normalized by flow and additionally increased when normalized by pH, total suspended solids, and temperature, but correlation decreased when normalized by a nucleic acid fecal viral indicator (PMMoV). On campus, correlations were generally not significant unless normalized by PMMoV and/or UV absorbance parameters. Because water quality parameters are routinely assayed at wastewater treatment plants and some may be collected by autosamplers, incorporating wastewater quality data may improve WBE models and could minimize molecular and cellular testing for fecal indicators to decrease costs.",Covid-19; Dynamic Population; Normalization; Wastewater Biomarkers; Wastewater Characteristics Analysis,,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),20763298,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191700009

This study presents the COVID-19 lockdown impact on the spatio-temporal evolution of surface water quality according to 5-year monitoring (2015–2021) using the global quality assessment system SEQ-Eau including the collection of water samples, some lab analysis, and the visualization of results through GIS tools. The same results were compiled statistically using the ANOVA approach in order to compare the spatio-temporal alterations. The evaluation of the quality of surface waters of four sites selected on the course of the Wadi Fez, and crossing mainly the district of Dokkarat, revealed that the organic and bacteriological pollution, before containment, exceeds the quality standards of surface waters and classifies these waters as being of poor quality. In addition, the concentration of fecal coliforms is very high, with a maximum value exceeding 100,000 CFU 100 mL−1, especially downstream from Wadi Fez. Moreover, the sites close to the Dokkarat district are characterized by very high pollution. The results obtained by the bivariate ANOVA test and their statistical validation show that the time factor influences most of the studied alterations. However, after 2020, the quality of the physicochemistry and bacteriology watercourse has considerably improved. Over 5 years (2015–2020), the data comparison shows an average increase in physicochemical quality of 31% and increasing bacteriological quality of 16%. This period is before and after the COVID-19 confinement. The reopening of industrial units as well as the acceleration of anthropic activities can explain the substantial impact they generate. Indeed, this study highlights the impact of the human activity on the quality of superficial water flowing along Oued Fez. It suggests a direct link between periods of industrial sustainability with high rates of pollution and in contrast, and it relates the improvement of water quality to the deceleration of those activities. Otherwise, decision-makers can rely on its results to locate the sources and the nature of pollution and anticipate these environmental patterns in the case of a future similar pandemic.

In this study, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) have been used to evaluate the mechanical stimulus-responsive antibacterial efficacy of the nanocomposite membrane. The membrane can effectively eradicate nearly 99% viable E. coli and 97% E. faecalis within a span of 40 min under mechanical stimulation (soft ultrasound ∼15 kHz). To further understand the mechanism, an evaluation of reactive oxygen species and bacterial FESEM was performed. These studies revealed that bacterial cells suffered severe visible cell damage after 40 min of piezocatalysis, elucidating the fact that the synthesized membrane is capable of producing a superior piezodynamic antibacterial effect.",Anti-bacterial Agents; Clay; Wastewater; Aquatic Ecosystems; Biocompatibility; Cost Effectiveness; Farms; Fluorine Compounds; Heavy Metals; Kaolinite; Membranes; Organic Chemicals; Sewage; Water Pollution; Cost Effective; Enterococcus Faecalis; Faecal Coliform Bacteria; High Load; Large-scales; Metalorganics; Natural Clays; Residential Areas; Untreated Sewage; Waterbodies; Escherichia Coli; Antiinfective Agent; Bacterium; Ecosystem; Wastewater; Anti-bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Clay; Ecosystem; Wastewater,Aquatic ecosystems; Biocompatibility; Cost effectiveness; Farms; Fluorine compounds; Heavy metals; Kaolinite; Membranes; Organic chemicals; Sewage; Water pollution; Cost effective; Enterococcus faecalis; Faecal coliform bacteria; High load; Large-scales; Metalorganics; Natural clays; Residential areas; Untreated sewage; Waterbodies; Escherichia coli; antiinfective agent; bacterium; ecosystem; wastewater; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Clay; Ecosystem; Wastewater,,American Chemical Society,15205827; 07437463,,LANGD,38446077,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85187106628

In this study, a quantitative microbial risk assessment approach based on existing literature was conducted to evaluate and compare the quantitative health risks associated with different age groups using various drinking water supply systems. Results showed that both community-supply and self-supply modes exhibit similar levels of risk. However, the self-supply water source consistently showed higher risks compared to the community-supply one. Borehole water was found to be a more suitable option than well water, consistently showing between 5 and 8 lower health risks for E. coli and fecal coliform levels, respectively. The sensitivity analysis further showed the importance of prioritizing the reduction of E. coli concentration in well water and fecal coliform concentration in borehole water. This study offers a fresh perception on quantifying the impact of exposure concentration and age groups, shedding light on how they affect environmental health risks.

The cholera outbreaks in 2016/2017 triggered emergency WASH interventions to improve water quality and reduce cholera and other water-borne disease incidence. Aim: This study aimed to assess the microbial water quality in Sana’a, Yemen, following cessation of the WASH activities. Methods: We collected and analysed water samples in 2022 from 64 out of the 381 mini water purification plants that benefitted from WASH interventions in Sana’a in 2018, 2019 and 2020.Face-to-face interviews with representatives of each mini water purification plant were conducted alongside observatory evaluations. We compared results of the 2022 analyses with those of 2018, 2019 and 2020. We analysed our data using Microsoft Excel 2010 and descriptive statistics and presented the results in tables and charts. Results: By 2022, one year after suspending the WASH interventions, the purification system rating had decreased slightly from 87.4% to 84.1%, and the water safety requirements rating had decreased significantly from 78.1% to 62.1%, compared to the 2018–2020 values. This caused a nearly double value, from 15.1% to 31.3%, for the microbial pollution, confirming an inverse relationship between microbial pollution and both purification system and water safety requirements. Conclusion: The microbial water quality of the plants was degraded due to the cessation of the WASH programme. It is important to consider sustainability issues when designing and implementing WASH programmes to ensure that they achieve their goals. It is also crucial to monitor WASH activities rigorously and invest in raising awareness of WASH benefits among operators and community members so they can become effective partners in preventing contamination and water pollution.","Sana’a; Wash; Water Pollution; Water Purification; Water Quality; Water Safety; Yemen; Drinking Water; Drinking Water; Article; Case Control Study; Cholera; Coliform Bacterium; Environmental Aspects And Related Phenomena; Face-to-face Interview; Fecal Coliform; Follow Up; Human; Microbial Contamination; Nonhuman; Water Analysis; Water Borne Disease; Water Contamination; Water Management; Water Pollution; Water Quality; Water Sampling; Water, Sanitation And Hygiene Activity; Yemen; Epidemiology; Hygiene; Microbiology; Procedures; Sanitation; Case-control Studies; Drinking Water; Humans; Hygiene; Sanitation; Water Microbiology; Water Purification; Water Quality","drinking water; Article; case control study; cholera; coliform bacterium; environmental aspects and related phenomena; face-to-face interview; fecal coliform; follow up; human; microbial contamination; nonhuman; water analysis; water borne disease; water contamination; water management; water pollution; water quality; water sampling; water, sanitation and hygiene activity; Yemen; epidemiology; hygiene; microbiology; procedures; sanitation; Case-Control Studies; Drinking Water; Humans; Hygiene; Sanitation; Water Microbiology; Water Purification; Water Quality",,World Health Organization,10203397,,EMHJA,39584436,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85199791361

Insufficient water supply is one of the issues confronting Middle Eastern countries, and Lebanon becomes a typical example. This study aims to evaluate the basic physical, chemical, and microbiological water properties for eight distinct sites, in southeastern Lebanon, identified during the coronavirus pandemic, as the worst economic situation to hit Lebanon began. These tests were carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO). The results were utilized to assess the level of environmental pollution. A comparison was made between the obtained results with other studies: Lebanon southwest and the northwest region of Jordan Valley. The novelty of this study stems from the fact that it is the first to shed light on the degree of pollution level and the lack of environmental education for water conservation and water pollution prevention in this unstudied area, and compares the results locally and regionally.

However, data on the impact of their feeding habits on the carriage of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are still scarce. To fill this gap, we examined the microbiota (16S rRNA amplicon gene sequencing) and the prevalence of ARG (high-throughput qPCR of 47 genes) in faeces from white storks (Ciconia ciconia) and lesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus) feeding in highly (landfill) and less (paddy fields) polluted habitats. Faecal bacterial richness and diversity were higher in gulls feeding upon landfills and showed a greater abundance of potential pathogens, such as Staphylococcus. In contrast, faecal bacterial communities from storks were similar regardless of habitat preferences, maybe due to a less intense habitat use compared to gulls. In addition, birds feeding in the landfill carried a higher burden of ARGs compared to the surrounding soil and surface waters. Network analysis revealed strong correlations between ARGs and potential pathogens, particularly between tetM (resistance to tetracyclines), bla<inf>CMY</inf> (beta-lactam resistance), sul1 (sulfonamide resistance) and members of the genera Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, and Peptoclostridium. Our work demonstrates how transitioning from paddy fields to landfills fosters the carriage of ARGs and potential pathogens in the bird gut, shedding light on the ecological role of these avian vectors in antimicrobial resistance dissemination.","Antibiotic Resistance; Ciconia Ciconia; Faecal Bacterial Community; Habitat Use; Larus Fuscus; Waterbird Trophic Ecology; Anti-bacterial Agents; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Birds; Ecosystems; Fertilizers; Genes; Land Fill; Mammals; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rna; Sulfur Compounds; Antibiotic Resistance Genes; Antibiotics Resistance; Bacterial Community; Ciconium Ciconium; Fecal Bacterial Community; Habitat Use; Lari Fuscu; Paddy Fields; Waterbird Trophic Ecology; Waterbirds; Feeding; Beta Lactam Antibiotic; Rna 16s; Sulfonamide; Surface Water; Tetracycline Derivative; Antiinfective Agent; Abundance; Antibiotic Resistance; Bacterium; Disease Vector; Feeding Ground; Habitat Selection; Habitat Use; Landfill; Network Analysis; Paddy Field; Species Richness; Waterfowl; Amplicon; Antibiotic Resistance Gene; Article; Bacterial Gene; Blacmy Gene; Ciconia Ciconia; Controlled Study; Ecology; Feces Microflora; Feeding; Gene; Gene Network Analysis; Gene Sequence; High Throughput Sequencing; Intestine; Larus Fuscus; Microbial Community; Microbial Diversity; Nonhuman; Peptoclostridium; Peptostreptococcus; Population Abundance; Prevalence; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rna Gene; Seabird; Soil; Staphylococcus; Streptococcus; Sul1 Gene; Tetm Gene; Animal; Bird; Charadriiformes; Genetics; Microflora; Waste Disposal Facility; Animals; Anti-bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Genes, Bacterial; Microbiota; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Waste Disposal Facilities","Antibiotics; Bacteria; Birds; Ecosystems; Fertilizers; Genes; Land fill; Mammals; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; Sulfur compounds; Antibiotic resistance genes; Antibiotics resistance; Bacterial community; Ciconium ciconium; Fecal bacterial community; Habitat use; Lari fuscu; Paddy fields; Waterbird trophic ecology; Waterbirds; Feeding; beta lactam antibiotic; RNA 16S; sulfonamide; surface water; tetracycline derivative; antiinfective agent; abundance; antibiotic resistance; bacterium; disease vector; feeding ground; habitat selection; habitat use; landfill; network analysis; paddy field; species richness; waterfowl; amplicon; antibiotic resistance gene; Article; bacterial gene; blaCMY gene; Ciconia ciconia; controlled study; ecology; feces microflora; feeding; gene; gene network analysis; gene sequence; high throughput sequencing; intestine; Larus fuscus; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; Peptoclostridium; Peptostreptococcus; population abundance; prevalence; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA gene; seabird; soil; Staphylococcus; Streptococcus; sul1 gene; tetM gene; animal; bird; Charadriiformes; genetics; microflora; waste disposal facility; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Genes, Bacterial; Microbiota; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Waste Disposal Facilities",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,38199372,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85182598545

In contrast to the purposeful use of chlorination ensuring antimicrobial safety of drinking water, only a limited body of research has addressed the molecular impact of chlorinated drinking water exposure on the gut microbiota. Here, for the first time, we have examined the differential effects of drinking water regimens stratified by chlorination agent [inorganic (HOCl) versus chloramine (TCIC)] on the C57BL/6J murine fecal microbiota. To this end, we exposed C57BL/6J mice to chlorinated drinking water regimens followed by fecal bacterial microbiota analysis at the end of the three-week feeding period employing 16S rRNA sequencing. α-diversity was strongly reduced when comparing chlorinated versus control drinking water groups and community dissimilarities (β-diversity) were significant between groups even when comparing HOCl and TCIC.

The aim of the study was to determine the probability of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection associated with human consumption of water from River Owena, Nigeria. Methods: Water samples were collected from points with intense anthropogenic activities during dry and wet periods. Loads of enteric bacteria and HAV were determined using culture-based method and molecular technique. Risks of HAV infection was estimated using dose-response model, and probabilities of clinical illness and mortality were also determined. Results: Results revealed that the levels E. coli and faecal coliforms were greater during the wet period than the dry period (p< 0.05). Concentration of HAV was greater during the dry period than the wet period (p< 0.05). Risks of HAV infection were higher during the dry period than the wet period, and were all above the US EPA acceptable risk limit. Risk of clinical illness and mortality due to HAV were higher during the dry period than the wet period.

So far, the relative contribution of natural and anthropogenic sources to fecal pollution in managed tropical watersheds remains poorly evaluated. In this study, the microbiomes of water samples collected from managed watersheds in Singapore were elicited using the PhyloChip, a dense 16S rRNA gene-based DNA microarray, and fecal impairment was inferred using a machine-learning classification algorithm (SourceTracker). The predicted contribution of wildlife fecal sources to environmental samples was generally negligible (< 0.01 ± 0.01), indicating a low likelihood of fecal impairment from natural sources. However, sewage showed considerably higher contribution (0.09 ± 0.05) to microbial communities in a subset of watershed samples from canals and rivers, suggesting persistent impairment of certain areas by anthropogenic activity although being managed. Interestingly, the contribution of sewage microbial communities showed decreasing trends from canals/rivers to the connected reservoirs, indicating meaningful auto-mitigation of fecal pollution in canals and rivers. Notably, exclusion of locally derived fecal samples and source categories from the training data set impaired the predictive performance of the classification algorithm despite a high degree of similarity in the phylogenetic composition of microbiomes in biologically similar but geographically distinct sources.","Microbial Source Tracking; Phylochip; Sourcetracker; Tropical Regions; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Sewage; Classification (of Information); Machine Learning; Microorganisms; Reservoirs (water); River Pollution; Rivers; Rna; Tropics; Watersheds; Anthropogenic Activity; Classification Algorithm; Fecal Pollution; Fecal Sources; Microbial Source Tracking; Microbiome; Natural Sources; Phylochip; Sourcetracker; Tropical Regions; Sewage; Biological Marker; Rna 16s; Algorithm; Classification; Dna; Fecal Coliform; Human Activity; Microbial Community; Sewage; Tracking; Tropical Region; Watershed; Article; Biological Activity; Chemical Composition; Classification Algorithm; Controlled Study; Dna Microarray; Environmental Factor; Environmental Mitigation; Fecal Pollution; Feces Analysis; Human Impact (environment); Incidence; Microbial Activity; Microbiome; Natural Resource; Nonhuman; Phylogenetic Tree; Pollution; River; Simulation Training; Singapore; Taxon; Trend Study; Tropical Watershed; Validation Study; Water Sampling; Wildlife; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Genetics; Microbiology; Phylogeny; Water Pollution; Singapore [southeast Asia]; Anthropogenic Effects; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Phylogeny; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Water Microbiology; Water Pollution","Classification (of information); Machine learning; Microorganisms; Reservoirs (water); River pollution; Rivers; RNA; Tropics; Watersheds; Anthropogenic activity; Classification algorithm; Fecal pollution; Fecal sources; Microbial source tracking; Microbiome; Natural sources; Phylochip; Sourcetracker; Tropical regions; Sewage; biological marker; RNA 16S; algorithm; classification; DNA; fecal coliform; human activity; microbial community; sewage; tracking; tropical region; watershed; Article; biological activity; chemical composition; classification algorithm; controlled study; DNA microarray; environmental factor; environmental mitigation; fecal pollution; feces analysis; human impact (environment); incidence; microbial activity; microbiome; natural resource; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; pollution; river; simulation training; Singapore; taxon; trend study; tropical watershed; validation study; water sampling; wildlife; environmental monitoring; feces; genetics; microbiology; phylogeny; water pollution; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Anthropogenic Effects; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Water Microbiology; Water Pollution",,Elsevier B.V.,18733336; 03043894,,JHMAD,37717440,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171425987

However, concerns about antibiotic resistance have led to the search for alternatives like probiotics. This study evaluates the outcome of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 (BA) administration on intestinal health profile, measured through histological structure examination (using scanning electron microscope) and fecal coliform and Escherichia coli enumeration, as well as overall health performance (growth-related parameters and ND genotype-7 virus antibody titers). A total of 90 one-day-old Cobb broilers were randomly assigned to three groups. The control group, G1, did not get any BA supplementation. The treatment group G2 was administered BA through their drinking water at a dose of 50 g/1,000 liters of water for 30 days. Finally, the treatment group G3 received BA at the same concentration but only on days 1-7, 13-17, and 23-27. Morphological parameters of the small intestine, health performance, and fecal microbial populations were measured on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. Antibody titers were sampled on day 30. On day 28, the villi height and width of the jejunum were significantly increased in G3 compared to those in G1 and G2. Over the experiment period, broilers in both treatment groups had higher (p<0.05) body weight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG) than the control group. Furthermore, G3 had significantly lower feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to birds in G2 and G1. Both treatment groups had lower coliform and E. coli populations in their fecal samples than the control group. The measured antibody levels were also significantly higher in the two BA groups compared to the control, indicating better protection.

As a result, people use commercially supplied jar water in the southern part of Bangladesh as well as in the Gopalganj municipal area. This study aims to investigate the physicochemical parameters, trace elements, and microbial parameters for assessing human health risks from oral ingestion of these elements. This study gathered commercially supplied jar water samples from 15 companies in the Gopalganj municipal area during the post-monsoon season. Temperature, potential of hydrogen (pH), total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), and salinity showed significant variation among the samples, and the level was within the national and international standard limits. The concentrations of iron (Fe) and arsenic (As) were measured using a UV–VIS spectrophotometer and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), respectively. The microbial analysis was conducted by the membrane filtration method. The study found that the water samples had an average concentration of 0.16 mg/L in terms of Fe and 0.016 mg/L in terms of As, with the mean value of As exceeding the standard limits. On the other hand, the mean Fe concentration value did not exceed the standards. Probable human health risk from heavy metal in the jar water was determined by hazard quotient (HQ), hazard index (HI), and carcinogenic risk (CR) assessments. A child (HI = 3.5914) is more vulnerable to non-carcinogenic human health risks than an adult (HI = 1.6931). Furthermore, pollution in water samples was found to pose a high carcinogenic risk, with children (CR = 1.6 × 10−3) being more vulnerable to carcinogenic risk than adults (CR = 7.5 × 10−4). In the microbial analysis, 100% of the samples exceeded the total coliform and fecal coliform standard limits, and 80% of the samples exceeded the Escherichia coli standard limits. Among the samples, 7% present high risk, around 47% present medium risk, 26% show low risk, and 20% show no risk based on the E. coli standard limits. This study did not find any samples that exceeded the extremely high limit for E. coli concentration. This study found that drinking jar water samples had inadequate quality, which may increase the risk of water-borne infections such diarrhea as well as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. As a result, the manufacturer of drinking water in jars must carry out the essential quality control procedures, and the government should regularly monitor the procedures.",E.

In 2014, the Wilder Institute/Calgary Zoo initiated North America's only zoo-based conservation breeding program for this species to bolster declining wild populations through conservation reintroductions. Within the managed population of sage-grouse, morbidity and mortality have primarily been associated with intestinal bacterial infections. As a preliminary study to assess the gastrointestinal health of this species in managed care, the fecal bacterial microbiome of adult and juvenile captive sage-grouse was characterized with 16S rRNA sequencing. The composition of the microbiome at the phylum level in greater sage-grouse is consistent with previous studies of the avian microbiome, with Bacillota as the most abundant phyla, and Actinomycetota, Bacteroidota and Pseudomonadota also being highly abundant. Antibiotic use and sex did not have a significant impact on the diversity or composition of the microbiome, but the management of juvenile sage-grouse did influence the development of the microbiome. Juveniles that were raised outdoors under maternal care developed a microbiome much more similar to adults when compared to chicks that were incubated and hand-raised. The local environment and parental care appear to be important factors influencing the diversity and composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome in this species.",Centrocercus Urophasianus; Conservation; Conservation Breeding; Gastrointestinal; Greater Sage-grouse; Managed Care; Microbiome,,,Oxford University Press,20511434,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85200942766

The effects of Nitrate-N and Nitrite-N in the water appear to be weaker compared to those of faecal coliform. The results establish that water pollution caused by excessive presence of faecal coliform is an important environmental factor in determining educational outcomes of children.

Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are monitored to assess recreational waters but may not reflect the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, a global leader in bacterial fatalities. Since many community-acquired S. aureus skin infections are associated with high recreational water usage, this study measured and modeled S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and FIB (Enterococcus spp., Clostridium perfringens) concentrations in seawater and sand at six beaches in Hilo, Hawai‘i, USA, over 37 sample dates from July 2016 to February 2019 using culturing techniques. Generalized linear models predicted bacterial concentrations with physicochemical and environmental data. Beach visitors were also surveyed on their preferred activities. S. aureus and FIB concentrations were roughly 6–78 times higher at beaches with freshwater discharge than at those without. Seawater concentrations of Enterococcus spp. were positively associated with MRSA but not S. aureus. Elevated S. aureus was associated with lower tidal heights, higher freshwater discharge, onsite sewage disposal system density, and turbidity. Regular monitoring of beaches with freshwater input, utilizing real-time water quality measurements with robust modeling techniques, and raising awareness among recreational water users may mitigate exposure to S. aureus, MRSA, and FIB. Practitioner Points: Staphylococcus aureus and fecal bacteria concentrations were higher in seawater and sand at beaches with freshwater discharge. In seawater, Enterococcus spp. positively correlated with MRSA, but not S. aureus. Freshwater discharge, OSDS density, water turbidity, and tides significantly predicted bacterial concentrations in seawater and sand.

Ground water is the major source of drinking water in the region. High concentrations of Fluoride (F) and Iron (Fe) have been reported in the region which poses high risk of rampant water-borne diseases. This study evaluates the ground water quality for drinking purpose in terms of 10 hydro-geochemical and two biological parameters in context of causative factors like land use and geology of the region. The occurrence of water borne diseases in resident population has been examined in association with quality of drinking water and priority areas for policy intervention have been identified. Water samples have been collected from 173 drinking water sources and 346 households consuming water from the selected sources have been surveyed for prevalence of water borne diseases. Water quality surfaces have been mapped in terms of F, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Hardness, Fe, alkalinity, Faecal Coliform (FC), E. Coli, and Water Quality Index (WQI) computed on the basis of 10 geochemical parameters, using Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) method. Results reveal that the north-eastern part comprising Aspur, Sabla and part of Sagwara tehsils predominantly has ‘very poor’ to ‘unsuitable’ water quality. The western part has excessive faecal contamination. Entire district has high levels of TDS and hardness, while excessive Fe and F occur in specific regions.

Such risks are enhanced during virus outbreaks, such as the COVID pandemic, and heat-Treatment is a commonly used mitigation measure. We examined whether heat-Treatment compromises wastewater analytical parameters results. We found that heat-Treatment of blackwater at 60 °C for 90 min in capped containers yielded no statistically different values (p.0.05) for pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia (NH3), total nitrogen (TN), total suspended solids (TSS), and turbidity for specimens from three different sources. This heat-Treatment inactivated coliform bacteria (.4 log10 reduction) thus compromising the measurement of commonly used fecal contamination indicators. The observation of intact helminth eggs in heat-Treated specimens suggests that the helminth egg enumeration assay is not compromised. These findings indicate that heat-Treatment for the safe handling of wastewater, as may be needed in future virus outbreaks, does not affect the measurements of many common wastewater physico-chemical properties.","Blackwater; Cod; Fecal Coliform; Heat Inactivation; Physico-chemical Parameters; Sars-cov-2; Ammonia; Crystal Violet; Nitrogen; Wastewater; Ammonia; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Contamination; Heat Treatment; Risk Assessment; Wastewater Treatment; Analytical Parameters; Blackwater; Chemical-oxygen Demands; Fecal Coliform; Heat Inactivation; Helminths Eggs; Measurements Of; Physico - Chemical Parameters; Raw Wastewaters; Wastewater Analysis; Coronavirus; Ammonia; Crystal Violet; Distilled Water; Nitrogen; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Heat Flow; Wastewater; Analytical Parameters; Article; Chemical Parameters; Coliform Bacterium; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Fecal Coliform; Heat; Heat Treatment; Mitigation; Nonhuman; Ph; Physical Chemistry; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Suspended Particulate Matter; Thermotherapy; Total Suspended Solid; Turbidity; Worm Egg; Animal; Biochemical Oxygen Demand; Helminth; High Temperature; Procedures; Sewage; Animals; Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis; Helminths; Hot Temperature; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Wastewater","Ammonia; Chemical oxygen demand; Contamination; Heat treatment; Risk assessment; Wastewater treatment; Analytical parameters; Blackwater; Chemical-oxygen demands; Fecal Coliform; Heat inactivation; Helminths eggs; Measurements of; Physico - chemical parameters; Raw wastewaters; Wastewater analysis; Coronavirus; ammonia; crystal violet; distilled water; nitrogen; chemical oxygen demand; heat flow; wastewater; analytical parameters; Article; chemical parameters; coliform bacterium; coronavirus disease 2019; fecal coliform; heat; heat treatment; mitigation; nonhuman; pH; physical chemistry; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; suspended particulate matter; thermotherapy; total suspended solid; turbidity; worm egg; animal; biochemical oxygen demand; helminth; high temperature; procedures; sewage; Animals; Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis; Helminths; Hot Temperature; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Wastewater",,IWA Publishing,02731223; 19969732,9781843395843; 0080336590; 0080310362; 9781843395959; 9781843396000; 9780080336695; 0080290930; 9781843391883; 0080304362; 9781843391487,WSTED,38096079,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85179769820

In this paper, we argue for the inclusion of Vibrio spp. abundance as a supplemental indicator of water quality for science-based coastal management by examining the environmental and bacterial indicators at a fish farm and a control site in Mali Ston Bay in the Adriatic Sea. Unexpectedly, heterotrophic bacteria, enterococci and Vibrio spp. were more abundant in the cold season, while E. coli and total coliforms, following a more traditional pattern, were more abundant in the warm season. Each of the currently used indicators has a specific purpose: heterotrophic bacteria indicate the presence of both nonpathogenic and pathogenic bacteria, while enterococci are pathogenic bacteria indicating fecal pollution. Vibrio spp. abundance additionally represents a non-fecal bacteria that can cause vibriosis in humans and aquatic organisms. Since vibriosis is the leading cause of disease-related fish mortality in aquaculture, pathogenic Vibrio spp. have large health and economic implications. These implications, as well as the added interpretative value when compared to other bacterial indicators, make Vibrio spp. abundance a good candidate as a water quality indicator. Significant dependence of the abundance on depth further differentiates Vibrio spp. from other indicators, thus bolstering the candidacy - especially in aquaculture areas. Before inclusion of any Vibrio spp. indicators into legislature, further research is needed particularly into (i) abundance thresholds characterizing water quality, and (ii) identification of species whose abundance should be monitored for best estimate of the disease risks.",Aquaculture; Legislature; Limit Values; Pathogens; Regulations; Anthropogenic Effect; Aquaculture; Bacterium; Coast; Pathogen; Water Quality,anthropogenic effect; aquaculture; bacterium; coast; pathogen; water quality,,Academic Press,02727714,,ECSSD,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85178305034

This study investigated total coliform bacteria, fecal coliform bacteria, and E.coli in drinking water and food stalls using water from a rural community, where the rural living conditions increase the risk of water-related diseases. In total, 40 samples of bottled drinking water, 50 water samples from vending machines, 30 samples of household drinking water, 30 food samples were collected from household food, and 60 food samples were collected from food stalls, and coliform bacteria contamination was determined using the most probable number (MPN) technique. The results revealed that all the water and food samples contained coliform bacteria contamination, while all the water samples and 50% of the food samples contained fecal coliform bacteria. The numbers of household food samples contaminated with coliform bacteria and E.coli were 29 (97%) and 12 (40%), respectively.

Hence, the present study has been introduced to assess the impact of the COVID-19 LKD coupled with seasonal variations (SVs) on the water quality status of the Hindon River (HR), Ghaziabad (GZB). The report includes secondary data analysis of different water quality parameters (WQPs), viz., dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), fecal coliform (FC), and total coliform (TC). BOD and DO are the preliminary indicators of organic load, and analysis of FC and TC determines the overall pathogen load in water bodies. The effect of seasonal variations, i.e., pre-monsoon (PRM), monsoon (MS), and post-monsoon (POM) at sampling locations designated by the monitoring body at HR (GZB stretch), viz., Mohan Nagar road bridge (MNRB), Karheda village (KV), and Chijarsi bridge (CB) was investigated for 2019 to 2021. DO level was comparatively higher during 2020 at sampling stations (SLSs) MNRB and KV. BOD reductions were ~17–40% during the LKD phase at SLSs KV and CB compared to PRD and PLD. The SVs significantly influence the DO and BOD at all the SLSs. The water samples during the PRM of 2020 showed lower BOD levels compared to 2019 and 2021 at all the SLSs. FC/TC ratio was highest at the LKD phase at all the SLSs. The coliform load was greater at SLS CB than at MNRB and KV. A strong positive correlation was obtained between TC-BOD and FC-BOD at the LKD phase during all the SVs. Based on the WQPs analysis, CB was found to be the most contaminated sampling location. Despite higher coliform loads, the LKD phase experienced overall improvements in DO and BOD levels.",And Coliform; Covid-19; Hindon River; Lockdown; Physicochemical Indices; Fecal Coliform; Physicochemical Property; Risk Assessment; Seasonal Variation; Water Quality; Hindon River; India; Uttar Pradesh,fecal coliform; physicochemical property; risk assessment; seasonal variation; water quality; Hindon River; India; Uttar Pradesh,,,00978078; 1608344X,,WARED,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85178141031

The accurate quantification of such risks is crucial in managing beaches effectively and establishing warning guidelines. In this study, we employed a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) framework to assess marine water quality and estimate the risks associated with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, an autochthonous pathogen that causes gastrointestinal illnesses, and enterococci, a traditional fecal bacteria indicator. The microbial contamination levels of V. parahaemolyticus and enterococci were determined from 48 water samples collected at two beaches in Thailand during dry and wet seasons. The accidentally ingested water volumes were obtained through a survey involving 438 respondents. The probability of illness (P<inf>ill</inf>) was estimated using dose–response models and Monte Carlo simulation. The results revealed that enterococci posed a higher risk of illness than V. parahaemolyticus at all seven study sites. The median combined gastrointestinal (GI) risk from both bacteria at all sites met the US EPA risk benchmark of 0.036 and the 0.05 benchmark set by the WHO, but the 95th percentile risk data at all sites exceeded the benchmarks. This emphasizes the need for the continuous monitoring and management of microbial pollution at these sites. The site-specific exposure data showed higher estimated risks with increased variations compared to the WHO-referenced values, which highlights the significance of locally measured microbial concentrations and survey exposure data to avoid underestimation. Estimating the risks from recreational exposure to waterborne bacteria can inform beach management policies aimed at reducing public health risks to swimmers. The study findings improve the understanding of the risks associated with water recreation activities at Southeast Asian beaches and offer valuable insights for the development of water quality guidelines, which are crucial for the sustainable development of the blue economy.",Autochthonous Pathogen; Fecal Indicator Bacteria; Marine Water; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment; Risk; Swimmers; Bacteria; Diseases; Health Risks; Intelligent Systems; Monte Carlo Methods; Risk Assessment; Risk Perception; Urban Growth; Water Quality; Autochthonoi Pathogen; Exposure Data; Faecal Indicator Bacteria; Fecal Bacteria; Gastrointestinal; Marine Waters; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment; Site-specific; Swimmer; Urban Beaches; Beaches; Autochthon; Beach; Fecal Coliform; Health Risk; Marine Pollution; Microbial Activity; Pathogen; Pollution Effect; Pollution Exposure; Pollution Monitoring; Quantitative Analysis; Recreational Activity; Risk Assessment; Sustainable Development; Swimming; Urban Area; Water Quality; Adolescent; Adult; Article; Autochthonous Transmission; Benchmarking; Comparative Study; Dry Season; Enterococcus; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Policy; Environmental Sustainability; Feces Microflora; Female; Gastrointestinal Disease; Health Hazard; Human; Ingestion; Male; Mathematical Model; Microbial Contamination; Public Health; Rainy Season; Recreation; Reference Value; Sea Pollution; Southeast Asia; Thailand; Vibrio Parahaemolyticus; Bacterium; Feces; Microbiology; Procedures; Southeast Asian; Bathing Beaches; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Humans; Risk Assessment; Southeast Asian People; Water Microbiology,Bacteria; Diseases; Health risks; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Urban growth; Water quality; Autochthonoi pathogen; Exposure data; Faecal indicator bacteria; Fecal bacteria; Gastrointestinal; Marine waters; Quantitative microbial risk assessment; Site-specific; Swimmer; Urban beaches; Beaches; autochthon; beach; fecal coliform; health risk; marine pollution; microbial activity; pathogen; pollution effect; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; quantitative analysis; recreational activity; risk assessment; sustainable development; swimming; urban area; water quality; adolescent; adult; Article; autochthonous transmission; benchmarking; comparative study; dry season; Enterococcus; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; environmental sustainability; feces microflora; female; gastrointestinal disease; health hazard; human; ingestion; male; mathematical model; microbial contamination; public health; rainy season; recreation; reference value; sea pollution; Southeast Asia; Thailand; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; bacterium; feces; microbiology; procedures; Southeast Asian; Bathing Beaches; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Humans; Risk Assessment; Southeast Asian People; Water Microbiology,,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,37517714,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85167455063

Administering bacteriophages (phages) is under evaluation as a possible intervention strategy in primary poultry production to reduce the public health risk of human infection. A major challenge is the translation of results from small-scale animal studies to large broiler flocks. In this study, the in vitro lytic activity of 18 Campylobacter-specific group II phages and 19 group III phages were examined singly, and in different combinations from the same group and from both groups using a planktonic killing assay. Based on these results, a combination of phage NCTC 12,673 (group III) and vB_CcM-LmqsCPL1/1 (group II) was selected for in vivo application in a seeder bird model to study its effectiveness under conditions as close as possible to field conditions. One hundred eighty Ross 308 broiler chickens were divided into a control and a treatment group. Ten days post hatch, seeder birds were orally inoculated with the C. jejuni target strain. Phages were administered via drinking water at a total concentration of 107 PFU/mL four, three, and two days before necropsy. Results: Combining group II and group III phages resulted in significantly higher in vitro growth inhibition against the C. jejuni target strain BfR-CA-14,430 than single application or combinations of phages from the same group. The results of the animal trial showed that the application of the two phages significantly reduced Campylobacter counts in cloacal swabs. At necropsy, Campylobacter counts in colonic content of the treatment group were significantly reduced by 2 log<inf>10</inf> units compared to the control group. Conclusions: We demonstrated that combining phages of groups II and III results in significantly increased lytic activities. The in vitro results were successfully translated into practical application in a study design close to field conditions, providing new data to apply phages in conventional broiler flocks in the future. Phage application reduced the fecal Campylobacter excretion and Campylobacter concentrations in the colon of broilers.",Antibacterial; Campylobacter; Chicken; Drinking Water; Phage Therapy; Resistance; Susceptibility; Drinking Water; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Article; Autopsy; Bacterial Count; Bacterial Strain; Bacteriolysis; Broiler; Campylobacter Enteritis; Clinical Effectiveness; Cloaca; Colon; Controlled Study; Food Poisoning; In Vitro Study; In Vivo Study; Infection Risk; Nonhuman; Phage Therapy; Plaque Forming Unit; Risk Reduction; Animal; Bacteriophage; Bird Disease; Campylobacter; Campylobacter Jejuni; Campylobacteriosis; Gallus Gallus; Human; Physiology; Poultry; Veterinary Medicine; Animals; Bacteriophages; Campylobacter Infections; Chickens; Foodborne Diseases; Humans; Poultry; Poultry Diseases,drinking water; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autopsy; bacterial count; bacterial strain; bacteriolysis; broiler; Campylobacter enteritis; clinical effectiveness; cloaca; colon; controlled study; food poisoning; in vitro study; in vivo study; infection risk; nonhuman; phage therapy; plaque forming unit; risk reduction; animal; bacteriophage; bird disease; Campylobacter; Campylobacter jejuni; campylobacteriosis; Gallus gallus; human; physiology; poultry; veterinary medicine; Animals; Bacteriophages; Campylobacter Infections; Chickens; Foodborne Diseases; Humans; Poultry; Poultry Diseases,,BioMed Central Ltd,14712180,,,37543585,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166597195

However, swimming pools can expose swimmers to physicochemical and microbiological risks. Accordingly, we studied the environmental health aspects and microbial infections for such recreational water aiming to disclose the possible risks they pose on swimmers. Methods: 26 pools in Alexandria, Egypt were checked for water quality; 13 pools were checked in winter then summer, and other 13 pools were checked in summer only. Water was collected from both the top and the bottom of each pool; a total of 78 samples were collected in sterile containers. Each sample was divided into three parts; the first part was used for assessing the bacteriological quality of water. They were tested for total colony count (TCC), total coliform (TC), fecal coliform, and E. coli. The second part was used for chemical analysis. The third part was checked for parasitological study. Results: Obtained data showed that only 7.7%, 78.2%, and 100% of the examined water samples have been found to fulfill the Egyptian standards for TCC, TC, and E. coli, respectively. Moreover, parasitic infection (PI) was noticed in 73.1% of the collected water samples; mainly Cyclospra and Isospora (37.2% each), followed by Cryptosporidium spp., Giradia lamblia, Microsporidia spp., and Blastocystis spp. (34.6%, 21.8%, 15.4%, and 14.1%, respectively). Acanthameba spp. was detected but at a lower rate (5.1%). The frequency of cleaning the swimming pools, flow rate, Cl<inf>2</inf>, and total dissolved solids are significantly affected PI, independently. Conclusion: The tested water samples don’t meet Egyptian bacteriological criteria.

The footprints of total coliforms (TC), faecal coliforms (FC) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in a conventional activated sludge WWTP during 12 consecutive months were clarified. It was found that TC, FC and E.coli in influent were significantly removed (log 4.71, log 4.43 and log 4.62, respectively) by WWTP with sand filtration playing a key role, and excess sludge was a major potential pathway for them flowing to the environment. Through quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), hand-to-mouth ingestion of untreated wastewater and wastewater in secondary/efficient sedimentation tanks, as well as accidental ingestion of sludge in dewatering workshop presented the highest infection risks of pathogenic E.coli in the WWTP, considerably exceeded the U.S. EPA benchmark (≤1 × 10−4 pppy). PPE application and E.coli concentration reduction in wastewater or sludge were recommended to reduce the infection risks at these stages. Further, partial ozonation and dissolved ozone flotation thickening were investigated able to reduce the infection risks at the stages of secondary and tertiary treatment of wastewater or sludge treatment by 90– 98 %. The findings of this study would assist in selecting appropriate processes for the further sanitation of WWTPs.","Coliforms; Footprints; Infection Risks; Removal Efficiency; Wwtps; Ozone; Sewage; Wastewater; Flotation; Ozone; Ozone Water Treatment; Ozonization; Reclamation; Risk Assessment; Sewage Pumping Plants; Wastewater Treatment; Water Treatment Plants; % Reductions; Coliforms; Fecal Coliform; Footprint; Infection Risk; Pathogenic Microorganisms; Probabilistic Assessments; Removal Efficiencies; Total Coliforms; Waste Water Treatment Plants; Escherichia Coli; Ozone; Activated Sludge; Coliform Bacterium; Fecal Coliform; Filtration; Footprint; Microbiology; Pollutant Removal; Probability; Risk Assessment; Sedimentation; Wastewater Treatment Plant; Article; Bacterial Growth; Controlled Study; Environmental Footprint; Environmental Sanitation; Human; Infection Risk; Microbial Contamination; Nonhuman; Ozonation; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment; Risk Reduction; Sludge Management; Waste Component Removal; Waste Water Treatment Plant; Wastewater; Water Filtration; Escherichia Coli Infection; Sewage; Water Management; Escherichia Coli Infections; Humans; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Wastewater; Water Purification","Flotation; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Reclamation; Risk assessment; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; % reductions; Coliforms; Fecal Coliform; Footprint; Infection risk; Pathogenic microorganisms; Probabilistic assessments; Removal efficiencies; Total coliforms; Waste water treatment plants; Escherichia coli; ozone; activated sludge; coliform bacterium; fecal coliform; filtration; footprint; microbiology; pollutant removal; probability; risk assessment; sedimentation; wastewater treatment plant; Article; bacterial growth; controlled study; environmental footprint; environmental sanitation; human; infection risk; microbial contamination; nonhuman; ozonation; quantitative microbial risk assessment; risk reduction; sludge management; waste component removal; waste water treatment plant; wastewater; water filtration; Escherichia coli infection; sewage; water management; Escherichia coli Infections; Humans; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Wastewater; Water Purification",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,37506894,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166210486

Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are often used to determine the occurrence of fecal contamination. However, FIB cannot provide the source of fecal contamination. Furthermore, as fecal inputs and contamination could originate from multiple sources (e.g., human, livestock, wildlife), multiple source tracking markers are required to identify fecal sources. From a previous study, we developed a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) metabarcoding approach to assess the presence of multiple homeotherms in four surface waters. Here, we have broadened our approach by sampling 86 surface water samples from the L'Assomption River and Ville-Marie watersheds (Province of Quebec, Canada). Fecal coliform levels were higher than the expected sanitary recommendations for recreational water (> 200 CFU/100 mL) in 73 % samples. The occurrence of mtDNA from human, livestock, domestic animals, wild mammals and wild birds was found in 40–88 % of the samples. Multivariate analyses showed significant covariations between homeothermic taxa and fecal coliforms, enterococci, β-D-glucuronidase, conductivity, the human-specific Bacteroidales Hf183 genetic marker, and the human population, in the watersheds of L'Assomption River (p = 0.001) and Ville-Marie (p = 0.015) (Province of Quebec, Canada). Through the application of Bayes Theorem, it was determined that fecal coliforms co-occurred with the detection of bovine, beaver, robin and chicken mtDNA in 100 % of cases in the L'Assomption River watershed, and human mtDNA co-occurred with fecal coliforms in 93 % and 76 % of cases in L'Assomption River watershed and Ville-Marie sub-catchment, respectively. This study suggests that fecal contamination could be the result of multiple species, among which some wild animals may contribute to fecal inputs in surface waters, resulting in potential risk to human health. This reinforces the necessity of using the mtDNA metabarcoding method to monitor multi-animal species.","Bacteroidales Hf183 Genetic Marker; Fecal Coliforms; Fecal Source Tracking; Mitochondrial Dna Metabarcoding; Qpcr; Beta Glucuronidase; Water; Dna, Mitochondrial; Water; Agriculture; Catchments; Contamination; Dna; Health Risks; Mitochondria; Multivariant Analysis; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reservoirs (water); River Pollution; Rivers; Watersheds; Bacteroidale Hf183 Genetic Marker; Fecal Coliform; Fecal Contamination; Fecal Source Tracking; Fecal Sources; Genetic Markers; Mitochondrial Dna; Mitochondrial Dna Metabarcoding; Qpcr; Source Tracking; Mammals; Beta Glucuronidase; Mitochondrial Dna; Surface Water; Water; Environmental Assessment; Fecal Coliform; Genetic Marker; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Article; Bacteroidales; Bayes Theorem; Beaver; Bovine; Catchment Area (hydrology); Conductance; Controlled Study; Dna Barcoding; Domestic Animal; Enterococcus; Environmental Monitoring; Fecal Contamination; Feces; Gallus Gallus; Human; Livestock; Mitochondrial Dna Metabarcoding; Mitochondrion; Multivariate Analysis; Nonhuman; Quebec; Recreation; River; Robin; Water Contamination; Water Sampling; Watershed; Wild Animal; Animal; Bacterium; Mammal; Microbiology; Procedures; Water Pollution; Canada; L'assomption River; Quebec [canada]; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Animals, Wild; Bacteria; Bayes Theorem; Cattle; Dna Barcoding, Taxonomic; Dna, Mitochondrial; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Humans; Water; Water Microbiology; Water Pollution","Agriculture; Catchments; Contamination; DNA; Health risks; Mitochondria; Multivariant analysis; Polymerase chain reaction; Reservoirs (water); River pollution; Rivers; Watersheds; Bacteroidale hf183 genetic marker; Fecal Coliform; Fecal contamination; Fecal source tracking; Fecal sources; Genetic markers; Mitochondrial DNA; Mitochondrial DNA metabarcoding; QPCR; Source tracking; Mammals; beta glucuronidase; mitochondrial DNA; surface water; water; environmental assessment; fecal coliform; genetic marker; polymerase chain reaction; Article; Bacteroidales; Bayes theorem; beaver; bovine; catchment area (hydrology); conductance; controlled study; DNA barcoding; domestic animal; Enterococcus; environmental monitoring; fecal contamination; feces; Gallus gallus; human; livestock; mitochondrial DNA metabarcoding; mitochondrion; multivariate analysis; nonhuman; Quebec; recreation; river; robin; water contamination; water sampling; watershed; wild animal; animal; bacterium; mammal; microbiology; procedures; water pollution; Canada; L'Assomption River; Quebec [Canada]; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Animals, Wild; Bacteria; Bayes Theorem; Cattle; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; DNA, Mitochondrial; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Humans; Water; Water Microbiology; Water Pollution",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,37454834,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165542707

However, many countries, including Ethiopia, do not have adequate data to report on basic water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services. Although contaminated drinking water spreads diseases like cholera, diarrhea, typhoid, and dysentery, studies on drinking water contamination risk levels in households are limited in Ethiopia. Therefore, closing this gap needs investigation. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 5350 households were included. A systematic, simple random sampling technique was used to select the participants. The information was gathered through in-person interviews using a standardized questionnaire. Furthermore, 1070 drinking water samples were collected from household water storage. Results: This investigation revealed that 9.8%, 83.9%, and 4.9% of households used limited, basic, and safely managed drinking water services, respectively. Besides, 10.2%, 15.7% and 59.3% of households used safely managed, basic and limited sanitation services, respectively. Yet, 10.6% and 4.2% of households used unimproved sanitation facilities and open defecation practices. Also, 40.5% and 19.4% of households used limited and basic hygiene services. On the other hand, 40.1% of households lacked functional handwashing facilities. In this study, 12.1%, 26.3%, and 42% of households’ drinking water samples were positive for Escherichia coli, fecal coliforms, and total coliforms, respectively. Also, 5.1% and 4.5% of households’ drinking water samples had very high and high contamination risk levels for E. coli, respectively. We found that 2.5% and 11.5% of households and water distributors had unacceptable fluoride concentrations, respectively. Conclusion: The majority of households in Bishoftu town lack access to safely managed sanitation, drinking water, and basic hygiene services. Many households’ water samples had very high and high health risk levels. Hence, the government and partner organizations should implement water and sanitation safety plans.","Access; Contamination Risk Level; Hygiene; Sanitation; Wash; Water; Fluoride; Nitrate; Drinking Water; Fluoride; Nitrate; Access To Water, Sanitation And Hygiene; Article; Bacterium Examination; Coliform Bacterium; Colony Forming Unit; Cross-sectional Study; Defecation; Environmental Parameters; Escherichia Coli; Ethiopia; Fecal Coliform; Hand Washing; Health Hazard; Household; Household Water Storage; Human; Hygiene; Open Defecation; Questionnaire; Sanitation; Sociodemographics; Storage; Waste Management; Water Contamination; Water Quality; Water Sampling; Water Supply","drinking water; fluoride; nitrate; access to water, sanitation and hygiene; Article; bacterium examination; coliform bacterium; colony forming unit; cross-sectional study; defecation; environmental parameters; Escherichia coli; Ethiopia; fecal coliform; hand washing; health hazard; household; household water storage; human; hygiene; open defecation; questionnaire; sanitation; sociodemographics; storage; waste management; water contamination; water quality; water sampling; water supply",,John Wiley and Sons Inc,23988835,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85176216127

The unexpected beach closures during the COVID-19 lockdowns have afforded unique opportunities to evaluate the impact of human activities on bathing water quality (BWQ). This study examined the temporal changes in fecal coliforms (FC) and streptococci (FS) within bathing seawater across a popular coastal region in Morocco during two lockdown periods (2020 L and 2021 L), comparing these data with observations from pre-lockdown years (2018, 2019) and post-lockdown periods (2020, 2021, 2022). Our findings illuminate the influential role the hiatus periods played in enhancing bathing water quality, attaining an “excellent” status with marked reductions in fecal coliform and streptococci levels. Consequently, the FC/FS analysis exposed a clear preponderance of humans as the primary sources of fecal contamination, a trend that aligns with the burgeoning coastal tourism and the escalating numbers of beach visitors. Additionally, the presence of domestic animals like camels and horses used for tourist rides, coupled with an increase in wild animals such as dogs during the lockdown periods, compounded the potential sources of fecal bacteria in the study area. Furthermore, occasional sewage discharge from tourist accommodations and wastewater treatment plants may also contribute to fecal contamination. To effectively mitigate these concerns and bolster public health, a commitment to relentless surveillance efforts, leveraging novel and innovative tools, is essential. These findings underline the crucial interplay between human activities and the health of our coastal ecosystems, emphasizing the need for sustainable practices for a safer and healthier future.",Bathing Water Quality; Coastal Tourism; Covid-19; Fecal Indicator Bacteria; Pathogens; Public Health; Beaches; Contamination; Ecosystems; Effluents; Health Risks; Public Health; Quality Control; Seawater; Sewage; Wastewater Treatment; Water Quality; Bathing Water; Bathing Water Quality; Coastal Tourism; Coastal Water Quality; Faecal Indicator Bacteria; Faecal Streptococci; Fecal Bacteria; Fecal Coliform; Fecal Contamination; Human Activities; Covid-19; Sea Water; Surface Water; Bacterium; Bathing Water; Coastal Water; Pathogen; Public Health; Seawater; Tourism; Water Quality; Article; Camel; Coastal Waters; Controlled Study; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Dog; Domestic Animal; Environmental Monitoring; Fecal Coliform; Feces Microflora; Health Hazard; Horse; Human; Lockdown; Moroccan; Nonhuman; Streptococcus; Waste Water Treatment Plant; Morocco,Beaches; Contamination; Ecosystems; Effluents; Health risks; Public health; Quality control; Seawater; Sewage; Wastewater treatment; Water quality; Bathing water; Bathing water quality; Coastal tourism; Coastal water quality; Faecal indicator bacteria; Faecal Streptococci; Fecal bacteria; Fecal Coliform; Fecal contamination; Human activities; COVID-19; sea water; surface water; bacterium; bathing water; coastal water; pathogen; public health; seawater; tourism; water quality; Article; camel; coastal waters; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; dog; domestic animal; environmental monitoring; fecal coliform; feces microflora; health hazard; horse; human; lockdown; Moroccan; nonhuman; Streptococcus; waste water treatment plant; Morocco,,Elsevier Ltd,0025326X; 18793363,,MPNBA,37677975,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169808473

To this end, we collected data at both regional (water quality measures from water treatment systems) and community (cross-sectional surveys) scales to examine determinants of enteric pathogen infection and diarrheal disease among infants in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Regionally, the Legedadi water treatment plant had significantly lower heterotrophic plate counts, total coliform counts, and fecal coliform counts compared with the Gefersa water treatment plant. The number of pathogen types in infant stool also differed by plant. Decreases in chlorine levels and increases in the relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria with distance from treatment plants suggest a compromised water distribution system.

The faecal pathogen transmission pathway is complex with several possible routes. Latrine front-end characteristics and usage behaviours are one key transmission pathway for microbial pathogens, however, there has not yet been a synthesis of the available research. This review aims to compare the microbial infection risks with latrine front-end components including any quantified microbial densities within the household latrines. This review was conducted with no restriction on the geographical location of the research. Of 118 studies reviewed, only ten (8%) have quantified the microbial density inside the household latrines compared to 109 (92%) measuring the infection risks. The reported risks were most frequent for specific bacterial (n = 34), and helminths infections (n = 32) compared to diarrhoea (n = 23), combined (n = 15), protozoan (n = 4), and viral (n = 4) infections. The infections risk decreased for using latrines lying at a higher position on the sanitation ladder (for example flush latrines) compared to those lying lower (for example pit latrines). The trend was similar for using floor materials that were easier to clean and less favourable for pathogen survival inside the latrines (for example, concrete as opposed to earth). Faecal coliforms were reported highest on the surface of the squat pan (743 CFU/cm2) of pour-flush latrines and helminths on earth floors of pit latrines (1.5 eggs and larvae per gram of soil). Irrespective of latrine type and its position on the sanitation ladder, a dirty latrine, evidenced by a visible lack of cleanliness, significantly increased the risk for all infections. This study recommends that effective microbial infection risk reduction in latrines can be gained efficiently by ensuring washable surfaces and consistent cleaning practices. Future studies should include more rigorous measurements of microbial densities in various latrine types incorporating the different front-end components and usage behaviours.",Faecal Pathogen Pathway; Latrine Front-end Component; Latrine Surface; Microbial Density; Microbial Infection Risk; Sustainable Development Goal 6; Animal; Family Structure; Helminth; Helminthiasis; Human; Sanitation; Animals; Family Characteristics; Helminthiasis; Helminths; Humans; Sanitation; Toilet Facilities,animal; family structure; helminth; helminthiasis; human; sanitation; Animals; Family Characteristics; Helminthiasis; Helminths; Humans; Sanitation; Toilet Facilities,,Elsevier GmbH,14384639; 1618131X,,IJEHF,37734133,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171468169

To address this knowledge gap, we developed an innovative monitoring approach for quantitative assessment of combined sewer overflow (CSO) impacts on the bacteriology of receiving rivers. Our approach combines conventional and environmental DNA (eDNA) based methods to generate multiple lines of evidence for assessing risks to public health. We demonstrated this approach by investigating spatiotemporal variation in the bacteriology of the Ouseburn in northeast England for different weather conditions in the summer and early autumn of the year 2021 across eight sampling locations that comprised rural, urban, and recreational land use settings. We characterized pollution source attributes by collecting sewage from treatment works and CSO discharge at the peak of a storm event. CSO discharge was characterized by log<inf>10</inf> values per 100 mL (average ± stdev) of 5.12 ± 0.03 and 4.90 ± 0.03 for faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci, and 6.00 ± 0.11 and 7.78 ± 0.04 for rodA and HF183 genetic markers, for E. coli and human host associated Bacteroides, respectively, indicating about 5 % sewage content. SourceTracker analysis of sequencing data attributed 72–77 % of bacteria in the downstream section of the river during a storm event to CSO discharge sources, versus only 4–6 % to rural upstream sources. Data from sixteen summer sampling events in a public park exceeded various guideline values for recreational water quality. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) predicted a median and 95th percentile risk of 0.03 and 0.39, respectively, of contracting a bacterial gastrointestinal disease when wading and splashing around in the Ouseburn. We show clearly why microbial water quality should be monitored where rivers flow through public parks, irrespective of their bathing water designation.","Combined Sewer Overflow (cso); Environmental Dna (edna); Microbial Source Tracking (mst); Public Health; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (qmra); Recreational Water Quality; Peptidoglycan Glycosyltransferase; Dna, Environmental; Sewage; Dna; Environmental Regulations; Escherichia Coli; Health Risks; Land Use; Public Health; Risk Assessment; River Pollution; Rural Areas; Sewage; Storms; Water Conservation; Water Quality; Water Treatment; Bathing Water; Combined Sewer Overflow; Combined Sewer Overflows; Environmental Dna; Microbial Source Tracking; Microbial Water Quality; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment; Recreational Water Quality; Rivers; Environmental Dna; Peptidoglycan Glycosyltransferase; Rna 16s; Conceptual Framework; Health Risk; Microbial Activity; Public Health; Quantitative Analysis; Water Quality; Article; Autumn; Bacterial Gene; Bacteriology; Bacteroides; Catchment Area (hydrology); Combined Sewer Overflow; Controlled Study; England; Environmental Aspects And Related Phenomena; Environmental Impact; Fecal Coliform; Gastrointestinal Disease; Gene Sequence; Genetic Marker; Health Hazard; Human; Land Use; Nonhuman; Pollution; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment; Recreational Park; Risk Assessment; River; River Basin; Roda Gene; Rural Area; Sewage; Sewage Treatment Plant; Sewer; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Streptococcus; Summer; Urban Area; Weather; Bacterium; Environmental Monitoring; Genetics; Microbiology; Procedures; Bacteria; Bacteriology; Dna, Environmental; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Public Health; Water Microbiology","DNA; Environmental regulations; Escherichia coli; Health risks; Land use; Public health; Risk assessment; River pollution; Rural areas; Sewage; Storms; Water conservation; Water quality; Water treatment; Bathing water; Combined sewer overflow; Combined sewer overflows; Environmental DNA; Microbial source tracking; Microbial water quality; Quantitative microbial risk assessment; Recreational water quality; Rivers; environmental DNA; peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase; RNA 16S; conceptual framework; health risk; microbial activity; public health; quantitative analysis; water quality; Article; autumn; bacterial gene; bacteriology; Bacteroides; catchment area (hydrology); combined sewer overflow; controlled study; England; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental impact; fecal coliform; gastrointestinal disease; gene sequence; genetic marker; health hazard; human; land use; nonhuman; pollution; quantitative microbial risk assessment; recreational park; risk assessment; river; river basin; rodA gene; rural area; sewage; sewage treatment plant; sewer; spatiotemporal analysis; Streptococcus; summer; urban area; weather; bacterium; environmental monitoring; genetics; microbiology; procedures; Bacteria; Bacteriology; DNA, Environmental; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Public Health; Water Microbiology",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,37209746,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160416762

Drinking water quality in Pakistan is decreasing gradually due to alarming population growth, rapid industrialization, climate change and lack of efficient water quality management. In Pakistan, the majority of the population doesn’t have access to safe and healthy drinking water sources, and people are forced to use unsafe drinking water. This review compiled data from multiple studies published in international and national journals from 2010 to 2022 and reports issued by the governments and non-governmental institutions to highlight Pakistan’s drinking water quality status, and to emphasize major water pollutants, sources of contaminants, and significant health problems. The results revealed that bacteriological contamination such as coliforms (total coliform, fecal coliform, Escherichia coli), toxic elements like arsenic (As), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), chloride (Cl−), fluoride (F−), mercury (Hg) and pesticides were found in both surface water and groundwater, and were the major causes of waterborne diseases. The majority of sampled water had bacteriological, physicochemical and toxic metals concentrations exceeding the National Standards for Drinking Water Quality (NSDWQ) and WHO drinking water quality standards.

However, this criterion has two significant limitations given that the BWD does not; (i) account for differences in hydrodynamic properties of bathing waters and, (ii) assumes that all faecal pathogens decay equally in aquatic environments. This study simulated sewage discharge events in three hypothetical aquatic environments characterised by different advection and dispersion parameters in the solute transport equation. Temporal changes in the downstream concentration of six faecal indicators were determined in simulations that utilised measured decay rates of each faecal indicator from a programme of controlled microcosm experiments in fresh and seawater environments. The results showed that the decay rates of faecal indicators are not a critical parameter in advection dominant water bodies, such as in fast-flowing rivers. Therefore, faecal indicator selection is less important in such systems and for these, FIB remains the most cost-effective faecal indicator to monitor the public health impacts of faecal contamination. In contrast, consideration of faecal indicator decay is important when assessing dispersion and advection/dispersion dominant systems, which would pertain to transitional (estuarine) and coastal waterbodies. Results suggest that the inclusion of viral indicators, such as crAssphage and PMMoV, could improve the reliability of water quality modelling and minimise the risk of waterborne illnesses from faecal contamination.",Advection And Dispersion; Bathing Water Directive; Crassphage; Decay Rate; Faecal Indicator Bacteria; Pmmov; Bacteria; Contamination; Dispersions; Hydrodynamics; Public Health; Risk Assessment; River Pollution; Sewage; Solute Transport; Water Quality; Advection And Dispersion; Bathing Water; Bathing Water Directives; Crassphage; Decay Rate; Faecal Indicator Bacteria; Fecal Contamination; Fecal Indicators; Hydrodynamic Properties; Pmmov; Advection; Advection; Bioindicator; Dispersion; Fecal Coliform; Health Impact; Hydrodynamics; Public Health; Aquatic Environment; Article; Contamination; Feces; Microcosm; Nonhuman; River; Sewage; Solute; Water Quality; Bacterium; Environmental Monitoring; Microbiology; Reproducibility; Swimming; Bathing Beaches; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Public Health; Reproducibility Of Results; Water Microbiology; Water Quality,Bacteria; Contamination; Dispersions; Hydrodynamics; Public health; Risk assessment; River pollution; Sewage; Solute transport; Water quality; Advection and dispersion; Bathing water; Bathing water directives; Crassphage; Decay rate; Faecal indicator bacteria; Fecal contamination; Fecal indicators; Hydrodynamic properties; PMMoV; Advection; advection; bioindicator; dispersion; fecal coliform; health impact; hydrodynamics; public health; aquatic environment; Article; contamination; feces; microcosm; nonhuman; river; sewage; solute; water quality; bacterium; environmental monitoring; microbiology; reproducibility; swimming; Bathing Beaches; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Public Health; Reproducibility of Results; Water Microbiology; Water Quality,,Elsevier Ltd,00431354; 18792448,,WATRA,37300999,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85161535086

Phylogenetic analysis of R. ornithinolytica and E. ludwigii isolates indicate that the gulls carried strains related to those identified in the WWTP samples. The results thus add to the increasing evidence of WWTPs as anthropogenic reservoirs for mobile genetic elements with antibiotic-resistance functionality. Such environments could profoundly impact the dissemination and spread of such genetic elements via for example aquatic birds, thereby warranting further study and surveillance.",Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria; Aquatic Birds; Carbapenemases; Environmental Hotspots; Mobile Genetic Elements; Wastewater; Ampicillin; Chloramphenicol; Ciprofloxacin; Cotrimoxazole; Gentamicin; Mecillinam; Meropenem; Nalidixic Acid; Nitrofurantoin; Piperacillin Plus Tazobactam; Tetracycline; Trimethoprim; Vancomycin; Beta Lactamase; Anti-bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins; Beta-lactamases; Carbapenemase; Wastewater; Biotyper; Magattract; Magnapure; Miseq; Nextera Xt; Antibiotics; Birds; Reclamation; Sewage Pumping Plants; Wastewater Treatment; Water Treatment Plants; Antibiotic-resistant Bacteria; Aquatic Birds; Carbapenemasis; E.

This study aimed to evaluate drinking water quality (DWQ) and associated factors in Bahir Dar City and the surrounding rural areas in northwest Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to June 2022 to determine coliform counts and basic physicochemical parameters from the drinking water samples (DWS) collected from urban, peri-urban, and rural sites. A total of 180 DWS were collected from water collection points and house-holds’ containers. Potentially pathogenic bacteria were also isolated from fecal coliform (FC)-positive samples and their antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined. Moreover, the risk factors associated with water quality were assessed. The water quality test results were evaluated against the WHO guidelines for DWQ. Based on the results of this study, only 16.7 and 73.88% of samples met the standards for total coliform and FC, respectively. Moreover, 95.4 and 43% of the isolated bacteria were resistant at least to one of the commonly used antibiotics and multidrug-resistant, respectively.

In laboratory studies, growth of HPB and other bacterial species is affected by physical and chemical attributes, but natural communities of HPB are not well understood. To determine how in situ environmental and water quality variables may affect density of HPB in the natural aquatic environment, we compared presence and abundance of HPB to ambient temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, fecal coliforms, male-specific coliphage, nutrient concentrations, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios, and C:N in water samples collected from July 2017 to February 2018 along a natural salinity gradient in a tidal river on the coast of northern Gulf of Mexico. HPB in water samples were quantified using a real-time PCR, most probable number method. HPB species were identified via 16S rRNA gene sequences. Temperature and salinity were determined to be the main factors driving HPB presence and concentration. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that different HPB were associated with different environmental conditions. Photobacterium damselae was found under warmer, higher-salinity conditions; Raoultella planticola was found at colder, lower-salinity conditions; Enterobacter aerogenes was found at warmer, lower-salinity conditions; and Morganella morganii was found at most sites, independent of environmental conditions. These results showed that naturally occurring HPB abundance and species composition can be affected by environmental conditions, which could manifest in various potentials for histamine formation and scombrotoxin fish poisoning risk based on environmental factors.","Histamine-producing Bacteria; Nutrients; Salinity; Temperature; Carbon; Histamine; Nitrogen; Histamine; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Carbon; Dissolved Oxygen; Histamine; Nitrogen; Rna 16s; Scombrotoxin; Toxin; Unclassified Drug; Aquatic Environment; Article; Bacterial Growth; Bacterium; Bacterium Culture; Coliphage; Comparative Study; Concentration (parameter); Controlled Study; Enterobacter Aerogenes; Environmental Impact; Environmental Temperature; Fecal Coliform; Fish Poisoning; Histamine Producing Bacteria; Mexico; Morganella Morganii; Nonhuman; Photobacterium Damselae; Population Abundance; Quantitative Analysis; Raoultella Planticola; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Risk Factor; Rna Sequence; Salinity; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Species Composition; Water Analysis; Water Quality; Water Temperature; Animal; Food Poisoning; Genetics; Gulf Of Mexico; Human; Male; Microbiology; Animals; Bacteria; Foodborne Diseases; Histamine; Humans; Male; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Water Quality","carbon; dissolved oxygen; histamine; nitrogen; RNA 16S; scombrotoxin; toxin; unclassified drug; aquatic environment; Article; bacterial growth; bacterium; bacterium culture; coliphage; comparative study; concentration (parameter); controlled study; Enterobacter aerogenes; environmental impact; environmental temperature; fecal coliform; fish poisoning; histamine producing bacteria; Mexico; Morganella morganii; nonhuman; Photobacterium damselae; population abundance; quantitative analysis; Raoultella planticola; real time polymerase chain reaction; risk factor; RNA sequence; salinity; spatiotemporal analysis; species composition; water analysis; water quality; water temperature; animal; food poisoning; genetics; Gulf of Mexico; human; male; microbiology; Animals; Bacteria; Foodborne Diseases; Histamine; Humans; Male; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Water Quality",,American Society for Microbiology,21650497,,,37310253,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168249963

Secondary data on various physical, chemical, and bacteriological water quality parameters were taken from published papers, reports, and theses. Surface and groundwater were the major sources of drinking water in these cities. The physicochemical parameters were total turbidity, pH, dissolved solids (TDS), sulphates, chlorides, calcium, sodium, HCO<inf>3</inf>, potassium, magnesium, nitrates, fluorides, arsenic, and hardness. The bacteriological parameters were total coliform, total faecal coliform, and total plate counts. The data revealed that pH, TDS, fluoride, chloride, HCO<inf>3</inf>, sodium, and hardness were above the limits in Karachi. MCB Market, Goth Ibrahim, and Malir Town were the main contaminated areas in Karachi. In Lahore, arsenic was found above the limits in all sampling locations. Turbidity, pH, HCO<inf>3</inf>, calcium, magnesium, and hardness were found above the limits in Peshawar. In Gilgit city, all physicochemical parameters were found within the limits except turbidity, which was 10 NTU in Nomal valley. Nitrates were higher in the water sources in Abbottabad. Bacterial contamination was found in the water of all five cities. Most of the studies revealed that this contamination could be human-induced. The improper disposal of solid waste, sewage, and animal waste and the excessive use of fertilisers deteriorate the quality of the water. Precipitation, a rise in temperature, and seasonal variation are climate variables that affect water quality and are responsible for major outbreaks of waterborne diseases.

Such diseases are an alarming situation for small cities in developing countries like India. In this research, to check the microbiological status of drinking water in Solan, Himachal Pradesh (India), water samples were collected from baories/stepwells (n = 14), handpumps (n = 9), and the municipal water distribution system (MWDS) (n = 2) in alternative months of the year (covering three main seasons). In 6 months, 150 samples were collected, and they were all examined for the presence of total coliforms and other bacterial pathogens. The associations between the isolates’ ecological and seasonal prevalence were also examined. The coliforms were detected by the Most Probable Number (MPN) method, whose range was noticed from the 2–540/100-ml MPN index. The colony forming unit (CFU) count for different samples at the base log 10 value ranged from 3.03 to 6.19. Different genera isolated and identified were Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteric subsp. enterica, Pseudomonas spp., Klebsiella spp., and Staphylococcus aureus. Overall, 74% of the isolates identified in water samples were from the Enterobacteriaceae family. E. coli was about 42.67% (n = 102), followed by Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica 20.92% (n = 50), Staphylococcus aureus 13.38% (n = 32), Pseudomonas spp. 12.55% (n = 30), and Klebsiella spp. 10.46% (n = 25) amongst the total of 239 isolates. The seasonal impact and the dependency of the occurrence of bacteria on one another were determined to be insignificant in the Spearman correlation test. These results showed that external factors (anthropogenic activities) are mainly responsible for the presence of these bacteria in water resources. The occurrence of bacterial isolates has been noticed in all water samples, irrespective of collecting site or season.",Bacterial Contaminants; E.

Design A community-based cross-sectional study. Setting Bishoftu town, Ethiopia, January-February 2022. Participants A total of 1807 mothers with at least one child under 5 years were included. Sociodemographic and WASH variables were collected using a structured questionnaire. 378 drinking water samples were collected. Outcome The response variable was diarrhoeal disease among children under 5 years. Results The 2-week prevalence of diarrhoeal disease among children under 5 years was 14.8%. Illiteracy (adjusted OR 3.15; 95% CI 1.54 to 6.47), occupation (0.35; 0.20 to 0.62), mother's age (1.63; 1.15 to 2.31), family size (2.38; 1.68 to 3.39), wealth index (5.91; 3.01 to 11.59), residence type (1.98; 1.35 to 2.90), sex of the child (1.62; 1.17 to 2.24), child's age (3.52; 2.51 to 4.93), breastfeeding status (2.83; 1.74 to 4.59), food storage practice (3.49; 1.74 to 8.26), unimproved drinking water source (8.16; 1.69 to 39.46), limited drinking water service (4.68; 1.47 to 14.95), open defecation practice (5.17; 1.95 to 13.70), unimproved sanitation service (2.74; 1.60 to 4.67), limited sanitation service (1.71; 1.10 to 2.65), no hygiene service (3.43; 1.91 to 6.16) and limited hygiene service (2.13; 1.17 to 3.86) were significantly associated with diarrhoeal disease. Conclusion In this study, diarrhoea among children is a significant health issue. Child's age, drinking water service, residence type and hygiene service were the largest contributors with respect to the prevalence of diarrhoeal disease. This investigation provides information that could help to inform interventions to reduce childhood diarrhoea. The findings suggest that state authorities should initiate robust WASH strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 3 agenda.","Epidemiology; Epidemiology; Immunisation; Infectious Diseases; Paediatric Infectious Disease; Preventive Medicine; Public Health; Fluoride; Nitrate; Drinking Water; Bcg Vaccine; Diphtheria Pertussis Tetanus Vaccine; Drinking Water; Fluoride; Nitrate; Surface Water; Article; Bcg Vaccination; Breast Feeding; Child; Controlled Study; Coughing; Cross-sectional Study; Decomposition; Defecation; Defecation Habit; Diarrhea; Diphtheria; Dyspnea; Environmental Health; Escherichia Coli; Ethiopia; Family Size; Fecal Coliform; Female; Fever; Food Safety; Food Storage; Human; Hygiene; Illiteracy; Immunization; Major Clinical Study; Male; Maternal Age; Medical Information; Occupation; Pertussis; Practice Guideline; Residence Characteristics; Sanitation; Sociodemographics; Structured Questionnaire; Sustainable Development Goal; Tetanus; Tuberculosis; United Nations Children's Fund; Urban Area; Waste Management; Water Quality; Water Supply; World Health Organization; Preschool Child; Questionnaire; United Nations; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-sectional Studies; Diarrhea; Drinking Water; Female; Humans; Sanitation; Sociodemographic Factors; Surveys And Questionnaires; Water Supply","BCG vaccine; diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; drinking water; fluoride; nitrate; surface water; Article; BCG vaccination; breast feeding; child; controlled study; coughing; cross-sectional study; decomposition; defecation; defecation habit; diarrhea; diphtheria; dyspnea; environmental health; Escherichia coli; Ethiopia; family size; fecal coliform; female; fever; food safety; food storage; human; hygiene; illiteracy; immunization; major clinical study; male; maternal age; medical information; occupation; pertussis; practice guideline; residence characteristics; sanitation; sociodemographics; structured questionnaire; sustainable development goal; tetanus; tuberculosis; United Nations Children's Fund; urban area; waste management; water quality; water supply; World Health Organization; preschool child; questionnaire; United Nations; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diarrhea; Drinking Water; Female; Humans; Sanitation; Sociodemographic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Water Supply",,BMJ Publishing Group,20446055,,,37500269,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165922096

Methods and Results: Using a co-created community science methodology, between 2017 and 2020, a total of 587 harvested rainwater samples and 147 garden soil samples irrigated with harvested rainwater were collected from four Arizona communities and analyzed for coliform, Escherichia coli, and/or Salmonella. Participants also completed a home description survey regarding their home and surrounding area, water harvesting infrastructure, and gardening habits. Conclusion: Chi-Square tests revealed that the quality of harvested rainwater is affected by proximity to a waste disposal or incineration facility, animal presence, cistern treatment, and cistern age (P < 0.05), while soil samples were associated with community (P < 0.05). Coliform and E. coli concentrations in both sample types were greater in the monsoon season.

The groundwater contamination documented for the shallow aquifer generates contamination of the deep unconfined type aquifer, from which part of the population’s drinking water needs are met. This study records incipient anthropogenic contamination of two types: biogenic and potentially toxic trace elements. The studied contaminants include fecal coliform bacteria, total coliform, nitrate, and potentially toxic elements such as: manganese ((Formula presented.)), mercury ((Formula presented.)), arsenic ((Formula presented.)), and cadmium ((Formula presented.)). This contamination in some locations exceeds the permissible limit for human consumption. Some major consequences to health, including severe illness, may be caused by the trace elements. The present results give a first signal about the contamination of the deep unconfined type aquifer due to anthropogenic activity in the valley.

Further, chronic diarrhea puts children at risk for mineral deficiencies, malnutrition, and stunting which, in turn, can result in cognitive deficits, poor performance in school, and decreased disease immunity in adulthood. Most diarrhea is caused by water contaminated by fecal matter. Interventions to improve clean water and sanitation can save lives; however, challenges persist in informal settlements. In this study, we explored the views of residents of informal settlements regarding water and sanitation in their communities. Focus group interviews were conducted with residents of 6 informal settlements in Kampala, Uganda (n = 165 people), and 6 key informant interviews were conducted with governmental and nongovernmental organizations that work to improve informal settlements or provide services to them. The results from this study demonstrate that, although these informal settlements had many infrastructure “upgrades” such as latrines and toilets, water taps, wells, and garbage collection and drainage systems, the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) system and its components largely failed due to point-of-use charges of water taps and toilets and the difficulty of emptying cesspits. Our results suggest that WASH must be considered a system and that multiple upgrading efforts are needed for WASH systems to work, including road construction and better oversight of fecal sludge disposal.",Diarrhea; Informal Settlements; Sanitation; Slum Upgrading; Slums; Solid Waste Removal; Wash; Water-borne Infections; Water; Water; Child Health; Diarrheal Disease; Fecal Coliform; Health Impact; Health Risk; Hygiene; Infectivity; Informal Settlement; Nongovernmental Organization; Qualitative Analysis; Sanitation; Solid Waste; Waste Disposal; Waste Management; Water Pollution; Water Quality; Adult; Article; Controlled Study; Drainage System; Female; Government; Health Service; Human; Information Processing; Interview; Male; Non-governmental Organization; Qualitative Research; Sludge Disposal; Uganda; Water Sanitation And Hygiene System; Well; Child; Diarrhea; Poverty; Procedures; Kampala; Water; Child; Diarrhea; Humans; Hygiene; Poverty Areas; Sanitation; Water,child health; diarrheal disease; fecal coliform; health impact; health risk; hygiene; infectivity; informal settlement; nongovernmental organization; qualitative analysis; sanitation; solid waste; waste disposal; waste management; water pollution; water quality; adult; Article; controlled study; drainage system; female; government; health service; human; information processing; interview; male; non-governmental organization; qualitative research; sludge disposal; Uganda; water sanitation and hygiene system; well; child; diarrhea; poverty; procedures; Kampala; water; Child; Diarrhea; Humans; Hygiene; Poverty Areas; Sanitation; Water,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),16604601; 16617827,,,37372767,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85163644061

In this study, we aimed to assess this microbiological threat to fish in an Algerian northwestern dam Sekkak (Tlemcen) by evaluating the diversity of ichtyopathogenic bacteria. In order to determine the water quality, physicochemical analyses of the dam water were carried out in situ. Ichtyopathogenic bacteria were isolated on selective media and identified by API galleries and molecular techniques (PCR and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene). Besides, the antibiograms were constructed for all the isolates. The physicochemical and bacteriological analyses allowed us to classify the dam water as moderately polluted to polluted. Furthermore, an important diversity of ichtyopathogenic bacterial species was observed as Aeromonas hydrophila, Providencia rettgeri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were retrieved. The antibiogram test revealed notable resistance. The antibiotic family for which most resistances were found was the β-lactam family, followed by aminoglycosides and macrolides. These results indicate that aquatic environments can shelter multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria representing a threat to the endemic fauna. Therefore, it is important to closely monitor these waters in order to improve the fish's living environment and ensure healthier production.","Algeria; Antibiotic Resistance; Environmental Pollution; Ichtyopathogenic Bacteria; Sekkak Dam; Ammonia; Amoxicillin; Ampicillin; Catalase; Cefaclor; Cefalotin; Cefotaxime; Cefpirome; Ceftazidime; Ceftriaxone; Cloxacillin; Colistin; Erythromycin; Gentamicin; Hydrogen; Kanamycin; Neomycin; Nitrite; Novobiocin; Oxacillin; Oxidoreductase; Oxytetracycline; Phosphorus; Ticarcillin; Tobramycin; Aminoglycosides; Anti-bacterial Agents; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Aminoglycoside; Aminoglycoside Antibiotic Agent; Ammonia; Amoxicillin; Ampicillin; Beta Lactam Antibiotic; Catalase; Cefaclor; Cefalotin; Cefotaxime; Cefpirome; Ceftazidime; Ceftriaxone; Cloxacillin; Colistin; Dissolved Oxygen; Erythromycin; Genomic Dna; Gentamicin; Hydrogen; Kanamycin; Macrolide; Neomycin; Nitric Acid Derivative; Nitrite; Novobiocin; Organic Matter; Oxacillin; Oxidoreductase; Oxytetracycline; Phosphorus; Rna 16s; Ticarcillin; Tobramycin; Unclassified Drug; Virginamycin; Antiinfective Agent; Acinetobacter Johnsonii; Aerococcus Urinaeequi; Aeromonas Hydrophila; Alcaligenes Aquatilis; Algeria; Antibiotic Resistance; Antibiotic Sensitivity; Aquatic Environment; Article; Bacillus Flexus; Bacterium Colony; Bacterium Identification; Bacterium Isolation; Biochemical Oxygen Demand; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Citrobacter Freundii; Comamonas Testosteroni; Conductance; Dam (barrier); Disk Diffusion; Edwardsiella Tarda; Enterobacter Cloacae; Enterococcus Faecalis; Environmental Monitoring; Fecal Coliform; Fish Disease; Freshwater Fish; Klebsiella; Leucobacter Aridicollis; Microbacterium Maritypicum; Microbiological Examination; Nonhuman; Photobacterium Damselae; Phylogeny; Physical Chemistry; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Proteus Mirabilis; Proteus Vulgaris; Providencia Rettgeri; Providencia Vermicola; Pseudomonas Aeruginosa; Pseudomonas Fluorescens; Pseudomonas Lactis; Pseudomonas Luteola; Psychrobacter Pulmonis; Salinicoccus Roseus; Salinity; Serratia Fonticola; Sporosarcina Aquimarina; Sporosarcina Globispora; Sporosarcina Newyorkensis; Staphylococcus Aureus; Staphylococcus Equorum Subs Linens; Vagococcus Fluvialis; Vibrio Alginolyticus; Vibrio Fluvialis; Water Pollution; Water Quality; Water Sampling; Water Temperature; Zone Of Inhibition; Animal; Bacterium; Genetics; Aminoglycosides; Animals; Anti-bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Water Quality","aminoglycoside; aminoglycoside antibiotic agent; ammonia; amoxicillin; ampicillin; beta lactam antibiotic; catalase; cefaclor; cefalotin; cefotaxime; cefpirome; ceftazidime; ceftriaxone; cloxacillin; colistin; dissolved oxygen; erythromycin; genomic DNA; gentamicin; hydrogen; kanamycin; macrolide; neomycin; nitric acid derivative; nitrite; novobiocin; organic matter; oxacillin; oxidoreductase; oxytetracycline; phosphorus; RNA 16S; ticarcillin; tobramycin; unclassified drug; virginamycin; antiinfective agent; Acinetobacter johnsonii; Aerococcus urinaeequi; Aeromonas hydrophila; Alcaligenes aquatilis; Algeria; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; aquatic environment; Article; Bacillus flexus; bacterium colony; bacterium identification; bacterium isolation; biochemical oxygen demand; chemical oxygen demand; Citrobacter freundii; Comamonas testosteroni; conductance; dam (barrier); disk diffusion; Edwardsiella tarda; Enterobacter cloacae; Enterococcus faecalis; environmental monitoring; fecal coliform; fish disease; freshwater fish; Klebsiella; Leucobacter aridicollis; Microbacterium maritypicum; microbiological examination; nonhuman; Photobacterium damselae; phylogeny; physical chemistry; polymerase chain reaction; Proteus mirabilis; Proteus vulgaris; Providencia rettgeri; Providencia vermicola; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Pseudomonas fluorescens; Pseudomonas lactis; Pseudomonas luteola; Psychrobacter pulmonis; Salinicoccus roseus; salinity; Serratia fonticola; Sporosarcina aquimarina; Sporosarcina globispora; Sporosarcina newyorkensis; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus equorum subs linens; Vagococcus fluvialis; Vibrio alginolyticus; Vibrio fluvialis; water pollution; water quality; water sampling; water temperature; zone of inhibition; animal; bacterium; genetics; Aminoglycosides; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Water Quality",,Sciendo,25444646; 17331331,,AMPOA,37314358,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85162883149

This study shows the feasibility of a novel method to nowcast fecal coliforms' (FC) presence in drinking water sources by applying a multilayer perceptron artificial neuron network (MLP-ANN) model. The model gives a binary answer for FC presence or absence in drinking water sources using a minimum of water quality and geographical parameters, which can be monitored in real-time as predictors with low-cost and in-situ equipment. Using 51,400 samples to train, validate and test the model with temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and total dissolved solids (TDS) as water-quality inputs and the water source type and location (as districts in India) as geographical inputs. The model achieved a total accuracy of 92.8% and a sensitivity of 98.2%, meaning that most FC-contaminated samples were classified correctly. In addition, precision reached 93.1%, meaning that most FC-contamination classifications were actually contaminated. The MLP-ANN performed better than the Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors models, with lower accuracies of 90.2% and 91.0%, respectively. The MLP-ANN model could characterize the water quality geospatially, learn from the parameters whether the water is contaminated by FC, and predict with high accuracy on new testing data. This method can be used as a part of a sensor for FC monitoring and management in water, reducing the time gaps between routine lab testing and thus improving drinking water quality and addressing the SDG 6 targets.","Artificial Intelligence; Drinking Water Quality Prediction; Fecal Coliform; Performance Evaluation; Sdg 6; Water-quality Monitoring; Drinking Water; Biochemical Oxygen Demand; Contamination; Dissolved Oxygen; Nearest Neighbor Search; Neural Networks; Potable Water; Artificial Neuron Networks; Drinking Water Quality Prediction; Drinking Water Sources; Drinking-water Qualities; Fecal Coliform; Multilayers Perceptrons; Performances Evaluation; Sdg 6; Water Quality Monitoring; Water Quality Predictions; Water Quality; Dissolved Oxygen; Drinking Water; Artificial Intelligence; Fecal Coliform; Performance Assessment; Prediction; Sustainable Development Goal; Water Quality; Article; Controlled Study; Data Analysis; Electric Conductivity; Feasibility Study; Geography; India; K Nearest Neighbor; Linear Regression Analysis; Multilayer Perceptron; Nonhuman; Nowcasting; Ph; Sanitation; Sensitivity And Specificity; Temperature; Turbidity; Validation Process; Water Borne Disease; Water Contamination; Water Management; Water Monitoring; Water Sampling; Water Supply; Child; Feces; Gram Negative Bacterium; Human; Microbiology; Preschool Child; Child; Child, Preschool; Drinking Water; Feces; Gram-negative Bacteria; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Water Microbiology; Water Quality","Biochemical oxygen demand; Contamination; Dissolved oxygen; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Potable water; Artificial neuron networks; Drinking water quality prediction; Drinking water sources; Drinking-water qualities; Fecal Coliform; Multilayers perceptrons; Performances evaluation; SDG 6; Water quality monitoring; Water quality predictions; Water quality; dissolved oxygen; drinking water; artificial intelligence; fecal coliform; performance assessment; prediction; Sustainable Development Goal; water quality; Article; controlled study; data analysis; electric conductivity; feasibility study; geography; India; k nearest neighbor; linear regression analysis; multilayer perceptron; nonhuman; nowcasting; pH; sanitation; sensitivity and specificity; temperature; turbidity; validation process; water borne disease; water contamination; water management; water monitoring; water sampling; water supply; child; feces; Gram negative bacterium; human; microbiology; preschool child; Child; Child, Preschool; Drinking Water; Feces; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Water Microbiology; Water Quality",,Elsevier Ltd,18736424; 02697491,,ENPOE,36958657,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151409917

Hence it is very important to treat sewage water in an efficient manner in order to reduce the public health risk. In the present work, various advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been evaluated for disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 from sewage water collected from STP inlet of academic institutional residential. The sewage water was subjected to ten AOPs, which include Ozone (O<inf>3</inf>), Hydrodynamic cavitation (HC), Ultraviolet radiation (UV), and their hybrid combinations like HC/O<inf>3</inf>, HC/O<inf>3</inf>/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, HC/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, O<inf>3</inf>/UV, UV/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, UV/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>/O<inf>3</inf>, and O<inf>3</inf>/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Further, AOP treated sewage water was subjected to total nucleic acid isolation followed by RT-qPCR for viral load estimation. The sewage water treatment techniques were evaluated based on their viral concentration-reducing efficiency. It was found that ozone and ozone-coupled hybrid AOPs showed the most promising result with more than 98 % SARS-CoV-2 viral load reducing efficiency from sewage water. Interestingly, the best six AOPs used in this study significantly reduced both the SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV (faecal indicator) viral load and improved water quality in terms of increasing DO and decreasing TOC.",Aops And Hybrid Aops; Hydrodynamic Cavitation; Ozonation; Pmmov; Sars-cov-2; Sewage Water Treatment; Cavitation; Diseases; Efficiency; Health Risks; Hydrodynamics; Ozone; Ozone Water Treatment; Ozonization; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sewage; Wastewater Treatment; Water Quality; Advanced Oxidation Process And Hybrid Advanced Oxidation Process; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Comparative Evaluations; Hydrodynamic Cavitations; Pmmov; Sewage Water; Sewage Water Treatment; Viral Load; Waterbodies; Coronavirus,Cavitation; Diseases; Efficiency; Health risks; Hydrodynamics; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Polymerase chain reaction; Sewage; Wastewater treatment; Water quality; Advanced oxidation process and hybrid advanced oxidation process; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Comparative evaluations; Hydrodynamic cavitations; PMMoV; Sewage water; Sewage water treatment; Viral load; Waterbodies; Coronavirus,,Elsevier Ltd,22133437,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149845807

However, estimating opioid use and exposure in a large population is almost impossible, and alternative methods are being explored, including wastewater-based epidemiology. Wastewater contains various contaminants that can be monitored to track pathogens, infectious diseases, viruses, opioids, and more. This commentary is focusing on two issues: use of opioid residue data in wastewater as an alternative method for opioid exposure assessment in the community, and the adoption of a streamlined approach that can be utilized by public health officials. Opioid metabolites travel through the sanitary sewer through urine, fecal matter, and improper disposal of opioids to local wastewater treatment plants. Public health officials and researchers within various entities have utilized numerous approaches to reduce the impacts associated with opioid use. National wastewater monitoring programs and wastewater-based epidemiology are approaches that have been utilized globally by researchers and public health officials to combat the opioid epidemic. Currently, public health officials and policy makers within Metro Atlanta are exploring different solutions to reduce opioid use and opioid-related deaths throughout the community. In this commentary, we are proposing a new innovative approach for monitoring opioid use and analyzing trends by utilizing wastewater-based epidemiologic methods, which may help public health officials worldwide manage the opioid epidemic in a large metro area in the future.","Opioids; Public Health; Wastewater Discharges; Wastewater-based Epidemiology; Ammonia; Buprenorphine; Codeine; Diamorphine; Fentanyl; Hydrocodone; Hydromorphone; Methadone; Morphine; Naloxone; Opiate; Oxycodone; Oxymorphone; Paracetamol; Pethidine; Phosphorus; Tramadol; Analgesics, Opioid; Wastewater; Ammonia; Buprenorphine; Codeine; Diamorphine; Dissolved Oxygen; Fentanyl; Hydrocodone; Hydromorphone; Methadone; Morphine; Naloxone; Oil; Opiate; Oxycodone; Oxymorphone; Paracetamol; Pethidine; Phosphorus; Tramadol; Narcotic Analgesic Agent; Discharge; Epidemic; Epidemiology; Monitoring; Public Health; Wastewater; Biochemical Oxygen Demand; Cause Of Death; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Drug Use; Environmental Policy; Feasibility Study; Fecal Coliform; Feces; Georgia (u.s.); Government; Human; Liquid Chromatography-mass Spectrometry; Ph; Prescription; Prospective Study; Review; Suspended Particulate Matter; Temperature; Total Suspended Solid; Trend Study; Turbidity; United States; Urine; Waste Disposal; Waste Water Treatment Plant; Wastewater-based Epidemiology; Water Quality; Opiate Addiction; Atlanta; Georgia; Analgesics, Opioid; Humans; Opioid Epidemic; Opioid-related Disorders; Wastewater","ammonia; buprenorphine; codeine; diamorphine; dissolved oxygen; fentanyl; hydrocodone; hydromorphone; methadone; morphine; naloxone; oil; opiate; oxycodone; oxymorphone; paracetamol; pethidine; phosphorus; tramadol; narcotic analgesic agent; discharge; epidemic; epidemiology; monitoring; public health; wastewater; biochemical oxygen demand; cause of death; coronavirus disease 2019; drug use; environmental policy; feasibility study; fecal coliform; feces; Georgia (U.S.); government; human; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; pH; prescription; prospective study; Review; suspended particulate matter; temperature; total suspended solid; trend study; turbidity; United States; urine; waste disposal; waste water treatment plant; wastewater-based epidemiology; water quality; opiate addiction; Atlanta; Georgia; Analgesics, Opioid; Humans; Opioid Epidemic; Opioid-Related Disorders; Wastewater",,MDPI,16604601; 16617827,,,37047898,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85152328053

Therefore, it is important to have regular quality control monitoring. This study aimed to assess the level of physicochemical and bacteriological quality of household drinking water and its contributing factors in flood-prone settlements of South Gondar Zone, Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in flood-prone settings of Northwest Ethiopia from January 17 to March 30, 2021. Structured questionnaires were used to gather the sociodemographic, environmental, and behavioral data. A total of 675 drinking water samples were collected from water storage containers of selected households. Logistic regression models were used for both univariate and multivariable studies. The survey included a total of 675 households. The mean values of pH (5.9 ± 1.03), turbidity (6.7 ± 2.21 NTU), and free residual chlorine (0.02 ± 0.01 mg/l) did not meet the WHO recommended limits for drinking water. The prevalence of fecal contamination of drinking water in the study area was 62.2% with [95% CI (53–60%)]. Family size [AOR = 2.205, 95% CI (1.375–3.536), absence of latrine [AOR = 3.449, 95% CI (1.349–8.823)], and lack of a separate container to draw water from its storage [AOR = 0.454, 95% CI (0.249–0.827)] were significant predictors for fecal contamination of household drinking water. In conclusion, the water quality in terms of pH, turbidity, residual chlorine, and bacteriological parameters was poor and not suitable for consumption. High prevalence of fecal contamination of water was found, and it was significantly associated with family size, the absence of a latrine, and the lack of a separate cap to take water from the storage. Therefore, continuous chlorination and monitoring its concentration, educating the community on how to use stored water, educating the advantage of having a latrine, and promoting point-of-use treatments such as filtration and boiling are needed.",Drinking Water Quality; Fecal Coliform; Flood-prone Settlements; Risk Factors,,,Elsevier Ltd,24058440,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151367828

We conducted a hospital-based study to explore wastewater management in healthcare facilities and analyzed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the hospital wastewater in Dhaka city during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak between September 2020–January 2021. We selected three COVID-hospitals, two non-COVID-hospitals, and one non-COVID-hospital with COVID wards, conducted spot-checks of the sanitation systems (i.e., toilets, drainage, and septic-tank), and collected 90 untreated wastewater effluent samples (68 from COVID and 22 from non-COVID hospitals). E. coli was detected using a membrane filtration technique and reported as colony forming unit (CFU). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using the iTaq Universal Probes One-Step kit for RT-qPCR amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab and N gene targets and quantified for SARS-CoV-2 genome equivalent copies (GEC) per mL of sample. None of the six hospitals had a primary wastewater treatment facility; two COVID hospitals had functional septic tanks, and the rest of the hospitals had either broken onsite systems or no containment of wastewater. Overall, 100 % of wastewater samples were positive with a high concentration of E. coli (mean = 7.0 log<inf>10</inf> CFU/100 mL). Overall, 67 % (60/90) samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The highest SARS-CoV-2 concentrations (median: 141 GEC/mL; range: 13–18,214) were detected in wastewater from COVID-hospitals, and in non-COVID-hospitals, the median SARS-CoV-2 concentration was 108 GEC/mL (range: 30–1829). Our results indicate that high concentrations of E. coli and SARS-CoV-2 were discharged through the hospital wastewater (both COVID and non-COVID) without treatment into the ambient water bodies. Although there is no evidence for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via wastewater, this study highlights the significant risk posed by wastewater from health care facilities in Dhaka for the many other diseases that are spread via faecal oral route. Hospitals in low-income settings could function as sentinel sites to monitor outbreaks through wastewater-based epidemiological surveillance systems. Hospitals should aim to adopt the appropriate wastewater treatment technologies to reduce the discharge of pathogens into the environment and mitigate environmental exposures.","Bangladesh; Faecal Contamination; Hospital Sanitation Facilities; Hospital Wastewater; Sars-cov-2; Viral Rna; Wastewater-based Epidemiology; Rna, Viral; Wastewater; Contamination; Diseases; Effluents; Escherichia Coli; Hospitals; Microfiltration; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rna; Sanitation; Septic Tanks; Wastewater Treatment; Water Quality; Bangladesh; Colony Forming Units; E.

The objective of this study was to assess the utility of 24-hour composites as representative samples for measuring multiple microbiological targets in wastewater, and whether normalization of SARS-CoV-2 by endogenous targets can be used to decrease hour to hour variability at different watershed scales. Two sets of experiments were conducted, in tandem with the same wastewater, with samples collected at the building, cluster, and community sewershed scales. The first set of experiments focused on evaluating degradation of microbiological targets: SARS-CoV-2, Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) – a surrogate spiked into the wastewater, plus human waste indicators of Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV), Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), and fecal coliform bacteria (FC). The second focused on the variability of these targets from samples, collected each hour on the hour. Results show that SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV, and B2M were relatively stable, with minimal degradation over 24-h. SIV, which was spiked-in prior to analysis, degraded significantly and FC increased significantly over the course of 24 h, emphasizing the possibility for decay and growth within wastewater. Hour-to-hour variability of the source wastewater was large between each hour of sampling relative to the variability of the SARS-CoV-2 levels calculated between sewershed scales; thus, differences in SARS-CoV-2 hourly variability were not statistically significant between sewershed scales. Results further provided that the quantified representativeness of 24-h composite samples (i.e., statistical equivalency compared against hourly collected grabs) was dependent upon the molecular target measured. Overall, improvements made by normalization were minimal within this study. Degradation and multiplication for other targets should be evaluated when deciding upon whether to collect composite or grab samples in future studies.",Composite; Degradation; Grab; Hour-to-hour Variability; Normalization; Sars-cov-2; Beta 2 Microglobulin; Oxygen; Sodium Chloride; Wastewater; Degradation; Diseases; Beta-2-microglobulin; Composite Samples; Degradation Rate; Faecal Coliform Bacteria; Grab; Hour-to-hour Variability; Normalisation; Pepper Mild Mottle Virus; Sewersheds; Simian Immunodeficiency Virus; Coronavirus; Beta 2 Microglobulin; Oxygen; Sodium Chloride; Composite; Covid-19; Degradation; Future Prospect; Microbial Activity; Wastewater; Article; Conductance; Controlled Study; Degradation Kinetics; Fecal Coliform; Growth Rate; Microbial Degradation; Microbiological Examination; Nonhuman; Pepper Mild Mottle Virus; Ph; Quantitative Analysis; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Salinity; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Time; Turbidity; Virus; Water Analysis; Water Sampling; Water Temperature; Watershed; Animal; Feces; Human; Animals; Feces; Humans; Sars-cov-2; Wastewater,Degradation; Diseases; Beta-2-microglobulin; Composite samples; Degradation rate; Faecal coliform bacteria; Grab; Hour-to-hour variability; Normalisation; Pepper mild mottle virus; Sewersheds; Simian immunodeficiency virus; Coronavirus; beta 2 microglobulin; oxygen; sodium chloride; composite; COVID-19; degradation; future prospect; microbial activity; wastewater; Article; conductance; controlled study; degradation kinetics; fecal coliform; growth rate; microbial degradation; microbiological examination; nonhuman; Pepper Mild Mottle virus; pH; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; salinity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; time; turbidity; virus; water analysis; water sampling; water temperature; watershed; animal; feces; human; Animals; Feces; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Wastewater,,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,36623667,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146056309

This study evaluated the physicochemical parameters and bacteriological quality of the stream and well water using standard protocols. The bacteria were identified by conventional and molecular methods. Antibiotic susceptibility and location of antibiotic resistance markers (ARMs) were determined using disc diffusion and acridine orange, respectively. The highest mean Total Heterotrophic Bacterial Counts (THBC), Total Coliform Counts (TCC) and Faecal Coliform Counts (FCC) from the stream water was 4.3 ± 0.3×106, 8.9 ± 0.0×105, and 3.5 ± 0.1×104 (CFU mL-1), respectively. The well water had mean TCC ranging between 2.8 ± 0.0×103 and 2.1 ± 0.1×104 (CFU mL-1). Six bacterial genera: Staphyloccocus, Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Shigella were isolated. The mean temperature of the water ranged from 26.0 ± 0.3o C to 27.0 ± 0.1o C. The highest mean dissolved oxygen, total hardness, sulphate and magnesium was 24.0 ± 1.0, 40.1 ± 0.8, 11.0± 1.0, and 67.0 ± 1.5 (mg L-1), respectively. The results showed that ≥ 66.7 S. aureus were Levofloxacin and Streptomycin sensitive; between 45.5 and 68.1% of the isolates were Gentamycin and Chloramphenicol resistant, while 81.8% exhibited multidrug resistance.

However, expanding impervious areas and poorly managed sanitary infrastructures result in elevated concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria and waterborne pathogens in adjacent waterways and increased waterborne illness risk. Watershed characteristics, such as urban land, are often associated with impaired microbial water quality. Within the proximity of the New York–New Jersey–Pennsylvania metropolitan area, the Musconetcong River has been listed in the Clean Water Act’s 303 (d) List of Water Quality-Limited Waters due to high concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). In this study, we aimed to apply spatial stream network (SSN) models to associate key land use variables with E. coli as an FIB in the suburban mixed-land-use Musconetcong River watershed in the northwestern New Jersey. The SSN models explicitly account for spatial autocorrelation in stream networks and have been widely utilized to identify watershed attributes linked to deteriorated water quality indicators. Surface water samples were collected from the five mainstem and six tributary sites along the middle section of the Musconetcong River from May to October 2018. The log<inf>10</inf> geometric means of E. coli concentrations for all sampling dates and during storm events were derived as response variables for the SSN modeling, respectively. A nonspatial model based on an ordinary least square regression and two spatial models based on Euclidean and stream distance were constructed to incorporate four upstream watershed attributes as explanatory variables, including urban, pasture, forest, and wetland. The results indicate that upstream urban land was positively and significantly associated with the log<inf>10</inf> geometric mean concentrations of E. coli for all sampling cases and during storm events, respectively (p < 0.05). Prediction of E. coli concentrations by SSN models identified potential hot spots prone to water quality deterioration. The results emphasize that anthropogenic sources were the main threats to microbial water quality in the suburban Musconetcong River watershed. The SSN modeling approaches from this study can serve as a novel microbial water quality modeling framework for other watersheds to identify key land use stressors to guide future urban and suburban water quality restoration directions in the USA and beyond.",Fecal Indicator Bacteria; Land Use; Microbial Water Quality Modeling; Spatial Autocorrelation; Spatial Stream Network Models; Urban And Suburban Water Quality; Autocorrelation; Bacterium; Concentration (composition); Fecal Coliform; Land Use; Pathogen; Pollution Monitoring; Prediction; River Pollution; Sanitation; Spatial Analysis; Streamwater; Suburban Area; Tributary; Water Quality; Watershed; Article; Artificial Neural Network; Ecosystem Restoration; Escherichia Coli; Fecal Indicator Bacteria; Forest; Geographic Distribution; Nonhuman; Pasture; Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis; Spatial Stream Network; Stream (river); Surface Area; United States; Urban Area; Water Sampling; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Human; Microbiology; New Jersey; Procedures; River; Musconetcong River; Bacteria; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Humans; Rivers; Water Microbiology,autocorrelation; bacterium; concentration (composition); fecal coliform; land use; pathogen; pollution monitoring; prediction; river pollution; sanitation; spatial analysis; streamwater; suburban area; tributary; water quality; watershed; Article; artificial neural network; ecosystem restoration; Escherichia coli; fecal indicator bacteria; forest; geographic distribution; nonhuman; pasture; spatial autocorrelation analysis; spatial stream network; stream (river); surface area; United States; urban area; water sampling; environmental monitoring; feces; human; microbiology; New Jersey; procedures; river; Musconetcong River; Bacteria; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Humans; Rivers; Water Microbiology,,MDPI,16604601; 16617827,,,36981647,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151110070

Floods exacerbate public health issues by spreading water-borne infectious diseases such as diarrhea through the destruction of sanitation facilities and contamination of drinking water. There has been a shortage of studies regarding the magnitude of diarrheal disease in flood-prone areas. Therefore, this research aimed to evaluate the prevalence of diarrheal disease and its predictors among under-five children living in flood-prone localities in the south Gondar zone of Northwest Ethiopia. Method: A community-based cross-sectional research was carried out in flood-prone villages of the Fogera and Libokemkem districts from March 17 to March 30, 2021. Purposive and systematic sampling techniques were used to select six kebeles and 717 study units, respectively. Structured and pretested questionnaires were used to collect the data. A multivariable analysis was performed to determine the predictors of diarrheal disease, with P-value <0.05 used as the cut-off point to declare the association. Result: The prevalence of a diarrheal disease among under-five children was 29.0%. The regular cleaning of the compound [AOR: 2.13; 95% CI (1.25, 3.62)], source of drinking water [AOR: 2.36; 95% CI: (1.26, 4.41)], animal access to water storage site [AOR: 3.04; 95% CI: (1.76, 5.24)], vector around food storage sites [AOR: 9.13; 95% CI: (4.06, 20.52)], use of leftover food [AOR: 4.31; 95% CI: (2.64, 7.04)], and fecal contamination of water [AOR: 12.56; 95% CI: (6.83, 23.20)] remained to have a significant association with diarrheal diseases. Conclusion: The present study found that the prevalence of the diarrheal disease among under-five children was high. Routine compound cleaning, the source of drinking water, animal access to a water storage site, vectors near food storage sites, consumption of leftover food, and fecal contamination of water were significant predictors of diarrheal disease. Therefore, it is advised to provide improved water sources, encourage routine cleaning of the living area, and offer health education about water, hygiene, and sanitation.",Diarrheal Disease; Drinking Water; Ethiopia; Flood-prone; Under-five Children; Drinking Water; Age; Article; Catchment Area (health); Child; Cleaning; Cross-sectional Study; Data Collection Method; Diarrhea; Disease Association; Disease Carrier; Environmental Factor; Ethiopia; Fecal Coliform; Flooding; Food Intake; Food Storage; Food Waste; Health Behavior; Human; Predictor Variable; Preschool Child; Prevalence; Risk Factor; Sociodemographics; Structured Questionnaire; Water Contamination; Water Supply,drinking water; age; Article; catchment area (health); child; cleaning; cross-sectional study; data collection method; diarrhea; disease association; disease carrier; environmental factor; Ethiopia; fecal coliform; flooding; food intake; food storage; food waste; health behavior; human; predictor variable; preschool child; prevalence; risk factor; sociodemographics; structured questionnaire; water contamination; water supply,,Frontiers Media SA,22962360,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147443731

This raises concern over the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in waterways and pose health risks of antibiotic resistant infections to water recreationists. The purpose of this study was to monitor water quality, microbial ecology, and antibiotic resistance in water and biofilm on submerged plastics at two public boat launches in southeastern Louisiana. Water and biofilm samples were collected once a month, in triplicate, from two public boat launches in Louisiana, USA for a year. Water quality metrics included nitrate, ammonia, sulfate, phosphate, and organic carbon. Water samples were tested for total and fecal coliform abundance and the presence of ARB. Out of 131 bacterial isolates studied from these two sites, 86% of them tested positive for antibiotic resistance with multi-drug resistance. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) for sulfonamide (sul2), bacitracin (bacA) and ampicillin (ampA) were identified in bacterial isolates from water and biofilm samples at both sites. Molecular genetic diversity analysis identified distinct taxonomic diversity differences in biofilm bacteria compared to the planktonic bacteria in the surrounding water. Biofilm samples showed increased diversity at the phylum, genus, and species levels.","Antibiotic Resistance; Biofilm; Boat Launches; Fecal Coliform; Planktonic Bacteria; Ammonia; Amoxicillin; Amoxicillin Plus Clavulanic Acid; Ampicillin; Bacitracin; Cotrimoxazole; Erythromycin; Meropenem; Nitrate; Phosphate; Polypropylene; Sulfamethoxazole; Sulfate; Tetracycline; Trimethoprim; Water; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Anti-bacterial Agents; Ammonia; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Boats; Health Risks; Organic Carbon; Sulfur Compounds; Water Quality; Antibiotic-resistant Bacteria; Antibiotics Resistance; Bacterial Isolates; Boat Launch; Fecal Coliform; Louisiana; Microbial Ecology; Planktonic Bacteria; Quality Metrices; Recreational Water; Biofilms; Ammonia; Amoxicillin; Amoxicillin Plus Clavulanic Acid; Ampicillin; Antibiotic Agent; Bacitracin; Cotrimoxazole; Dissolved Oxygen; Erythromycin; Genomic Dna; Meropenem; Nitrate; Organic Carbon; Penicillin Derivative; Phosphate; Plastic; Polypropylene; Rna 16s; Sulfamethoxazole; Sulfate; Sulfonamide; Tetracycline; Trimethoprim; Water; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonist; Antiinfective Agent; Dipeptidyl Carboxypeptidase Inhibitor; Antibiotic Resistance; Bacterium; Biofilm; Fecal Coliform; Water Quality; Ampa Gene; Article; Baca Gene; Bacterial Gene; Bacterium Isolate; Controlled Study; Dna Isolation; Enterobacter; Enterococcus; Escherichia Coli; Health Hazard; High Performance Liquid Chromatography; Klebsiella Pneumoniae; Nonhuman; Species Diversity; Staphylococcus; Streptococcus; Sul2 Gene; Water Management; Water Temperature; Genetics; United States; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Anti-bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Genes, Bacterial; Water Quality","Ammonia; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Boats; Health risks; Organic carbon; Sulfur compounds; Water quality; Antibiotic-resistant bacteria; Antibiotics resistance; Bacterial isolates; Boat launch; Fecal Coliform; Louisiana; Microbial ecology; Planktonic bacteria; Quality metrices; Recreational water; Biofilms; ammonia; amoxicillin; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; ampicillin; antibiotic agent; bacitracin; cotrimoxazole; dissolved oxygen; erythromycin; genomic DNA; meropenem; nitrate; organic carbon; penicillin derivative; phosphate; plastic; polypropylene; RNA 16S; sulfamethoxazole; sulfate; sulfonamide; tetracycline; trimethoprim; water; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antiinfective agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; antibiotic resistance; bacterium; biofilm; fecal coliform; water quality; ampA gene; Article; bacA gene; bacterial gene; bacterium isolate; controlled study; DNA isolation; Enterobacter; Enterococcus; Escherichia coli; health hazard; high performance liquid chromatography; Klebsiella pneumoniae; nonhuman; species diversity; Staphylococcus; Streptococcus; sul2 gene; water management; water temperature; genetics; United States; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Genes, Bacterial; Water Quality",,Elsevier Ltd,18732976; 09608524,,BIRTE,36584719,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145323591

Y., Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom; Ahmadian, Reza, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom","High levels of fecal-indicator organisms (FIOs) at bathing water sites can cause disease and impose threats to public health. There is a need for predicting FIO levels to inform the public and reduce exposure. Data-driven models are one of the main tools being considered as predictive models. However, identifying the main inputs of the data-driven models is a major challenge in developing FIO predictor models. This paper develops a data-driven model for FIO concentration prediction based on a limited number of critical input variables. Essential variables were identified with be a combination of the gamma test and Genetic Algorithm (Gamma-GA test). Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and linear regression models were developed using these two variable identification approaches for comparison. The models were applied to a case study, and it was found that the model using the Gamma-GA test has a high potential to predict FIO levels more accurately, although this requires further investigation with different case studies. A correlation analysis was required prior to the variable identification approaches in this study. The need of this analysis highlights the significance of understanding the waterbody and the data set in the development and application of data-driven models. Models using a Gamma-GA test were more capable of predicting extreme (high) FIO concentrations, making a Gamma-GA test more suitable for a bathing water quality early warning system. The importance of nonlinearity in such predictive models was also demonstrated by the better performance of nonlinear ANN models compared with linear regression models regardless of the variable identification approaches used. This paper highlights the importance of nonlinearity in bathing water quality prediction and encourages further utilization of nonlinear models for this application.",Forecasting; Genetic Algorithms; Health Risks; Neural Networks; Public Health; Water Pollution; Water Resources; Bathing Water; Case-studies; Coastal Waters; Concentration Prediction; Data-driven Model; Fecal Indicator Organisms; Identification Approach; Intelligence Models; Linear Regression Modelling; Predictive Models; Water Quality; Artificial Neural Network; Bioindicator; Coastal Water; Complexity; Concentration (composition); Fecal Coliform; Genetic Algorithm; Nonlinearity; Prediction; Water Quality,Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Health risks; Neural networks; Public health; Water pollution; Water resources; Bathing water; Case-studies; Coastal waters; Concentration prediction; Data-driven model; Fecal indicator organisms; Identification approach; Intelligence models; Linear regression modelling; Predictive models; Water quality; artificial neural network; bioindicator; coastal water; complexity; concentration (composition); fecal coliform; genetic algorithm; nonlinearity; prediction; water quality,,American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE),07339372; 19437870,,JOEED,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144132278

The methodology consists of 1) catchment surveys complemented by literature data where needed for probabilistic estimates of daily produced fecal indicator (FIBs, E. coli, enterococci) and zoonotic reference pathogen numbers (Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium and Giardia) excreted by human and animal sources in a river catchment, 2) generating a hypothesis about the dominant sources of fecal pollution and selecting a source targeted monitoring design, and 3) verifying the results by comparing measured concentrations of the informed choice of parameters (i.e. chemical tracers, C. perfringensspores, and host-associated genetic microbial source tracking (MST) markers) in the river, and by multi-parametric correlation analysis. We tested the approach at a study area in Vienna, Austria. The daily produced microbial particle numbers according to the probabilistic estimates indicated that, for the dry weather scenario, the discharge of treated wastewater (WWTP) was the primary contributor to fecal pollution. For the wet weather scenario, 80–99 % of the daily produced FIBs and pathogens resulted from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) according to the probabilistic estimates. When testing our hypothesis in the river, the measured concentrations of the human genetic fecal marker were log<inf>10</inf> 4 higher than for selected animal genetic fecal markers. Our analyses showed for the first-time statistical relationships between C. perfringens spores (used as conservative microbial tracer for communal sewage) and a human genetic fecal marker (i.e. HF183/BacR287) with the reference pathogen Giardia in river water (Spearman rank correlation: 0.78–0.83, p < 0.05.

Following this trend, infectious disease outbreaks associated with their consumption have been reported more frequently. Molluscs are a diverse group of organisms found wild and farmed. They are common on our tables, but unfortunately, despite their great taste, they can also pose a threat as a potential vector for numerous species of pathogenic microorganisms. Clams, in particular, might be filled with pathogens because of their filter-feeding diet. This specific way of feeding favors the accumulation of excessive amounts of pathogenic microorganisms like Vibrio spp., including Vibrio cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Arcobacter spp., and fecal coliforms, and intestinal enterococci. The problems of pathogen dissemination and disease outbreaks caused by exogenous bacteria in many geographical regions quickly became an unwanted effect of globalized food supply chains, global climate change, and natural pathogen transmission dynamics. Moreover, some pathogens like Shewanella spp., with high zoonotic potential, are spreading worldwide along with food transport. These bacteria, contained in food, are also responsible for the potential transmission of antibiotic-resistance genes to species belonging to the human microbiota. Finally, they end up in wastewater, thus colonizing new areas, which enables them to introduce new antibiotic-resistance genes (ARG) into the environment and extend the existing spectrum of ARGs already present in local biomes. Foodborne pathogens require modern methods of detection. Similarly, detecting ARGs is necessary to prevent resistance dissemination in new environments, thus preventing future outbreaks, which could threaten associated consumers and workers in the food processing industry.",Antibiotic-resistance; Aquaculture; Bacteria; Bivalves; Foodborne Diseases; Genes; Molluscs; Zoonoses; Aeromonas; Antibiotic Resistance; Aquaculture; Aquatic Environment; Bacteremia; Bacterial Growth; Bacterial Strain; Bacterium Identification; Bacterium Isolation; Clostridioides Difficile; Coinfection; Coliform Bacterium; Disk Diffusion; Environmental Factor; Epidemic; Escherichia Coli; Eutrophication; Food Intake; High Throughput Analysis; Human; Human Impact (environment); Marine Environment; Microbial Community; Microbial Diversity; Mollusc; Multidrug Resistance; Nocardia; Nonhuman; Pathogen Transmission; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Prevalence; Pseudomonas Aeruginosa; Review; Risk Assessment; Shellfish; Shewanella; Vibrio Cholerae; Vibriosis; Waste Water Management; Zoonosis,Aeromonas; antibiotic resistance; aquaculture; aquatic environment; bacteremia; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterium identification; bacterium isolation; Clostridioides difficile; coinfection; coliform bacterium; disk diffusion; environmental factor; epidemic; Escherichia coli; eutrophication; food intake; high throughput analysis; human; human impact (environment); marine environment; microbial community; microbial diversity; mollusc; multidrug resistance; Nocardia; nonhuman; pathogen transmission; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Review; risk assessment; shellfish; Shewanella; Vibrio cholerae; vibriosis; waste water management; zoonosis,,Frontiers Media S.A.,1664302X,,,,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146858166

The crisis for clean water is everywhere. So there has been an urgent need for clean water. Most people are not aware of clean water and are consuming dirty and infected water, and they suffer from different diseases. In our work, we attempt to analyze the water quality depending on various parameters like pH, temperature, conductivity, nitrate concentration, BOD, fecal coliform, and total coliform. Based on these parameters, our ML model will predict whether the water is clean and safe for consumption or not. To detect the index of the quality of water we have applied the concept of supervised ML techniques, and based on the range, we will be able to state the quality of water to be excellent or good or fair or poor or very poor or unfit for drinking.

The mean values of the parameters were as follows: total dissolved solids (TDS) (142.79 mg/L), temperature (22.08°C), turbidity (9.49 NTU), electrical conductivity (EC) (250.14°μS/cm), pH (7.45 mg/L), fluoride (1.15 mg/L), nitrate (NO3-) (2.91 mg/L), total hardness (TH) (57.45 mg/L), calcium (41.7 6 mg/l), magnesium (10.74 mg/L), phosphate (0.44 mg/L), sulfate (3.99 mg/L), residual chlorine (1.53 mg/L), alkalinity (196.39 mg/L), and microbiological (total coliform and coliform/CFU) which were the main physiochemical parameters analyzed for the study. The findings revealed that the majority of the water quality parameters tested were within the WHO and National Drinking Water Quality Standards (NDWQS). However, some of the parameters such as temperature, turbidity, fluoride, and residual chlorine did not meet the standards. The mean temperatures at the source, reservoir, and tap water were 22.01°C 22.5°C,and 21.83°C, respectively. Turbidity levels in source samples ranged from 10 to 45 NTU, with a mean of 24.5 NTU, exceeding the WHO's recommendation of less than 5 NTU. The Boko Alamura well had a high fluoride content (3.9 mg/l), which was above the WHO and NDWQS permissible limits. There was no free residual chlorine in the tap water sample. The results show that the Hawassa drinking water supply did not contain total or fecal coliform in any of the samples tested. The overall WQI for the water source, reservoir, and tap water was also determined to be 89, 71, and 69.7 points, respectively. Therefore, based on the WQI result, Hawassa drinking water quality is good for the source, reservoir, and tap water.",Alkalinity; Chlorine; Developing Countries; Fluorine Compounds; Health Risks; Potable Water; Reservoirs (water); Sulfur Compounds; Water Absorption; Water Quality; Water Supply; Water Supply Systems; Drinking-water Qualities; Ethiopia; Reservoir Water; Residual Chlorines; Source Waters; Tap Water; Total Coliforms; Water Quality Parameters; Water Quality Standard; Water Samples; Turbidity,Alkalinity; Chlorine; Developing countries; Fluorine compounds; Health risks; Potable water; Reservoirs (water); Sulfur compounds; Water absorption; Water quality; Water supply; Water supply systems; Drinking-water qualities; Ethiopia; Reservoir water; Residual chlorines; Source waters; Tap water; Total coliforms; Water quality parameters; Water quality standard; Water samples; Turbidity,,Hindawi Limited,16878779; 16878760,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85170553079

However, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has determined turbidity and fecal coliform bacteria occur in Pipestone Creek in high enough numbers to be a potential health hazard. Concerns also were raised about exposure risk from waterfall mist to visitors and staff. The U.S. Geological Survey and the National Park Service collaborated on a study to collect 21 water-quality samples from 8 creek sites and 3 quarries in 2018 and analyzed them for over 250 water-quality parameters and contaminants. Additional samples were collected in August 2019 to assess the waterfall mists from Winnewissa Falls. Nutrient concentrations in the creek and quarries were elevated in 2018, indicating they are affected by agricultural inputs. All sample concentrations for nitrate and total nitrogen in Pipestone Creek exceeded Minnesota standards and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency nutrient criteria. Minnesota standards and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency nutrient criteria for total phosphorus also were exceeded in some of the quarry samples. Twenty of 210 micropollutants had measurable concentrations: 13 pesticides, 5 pharmaceuticals, and 2 other types of micropollutants. Atrazine, deethylatrazine, and metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid were detected in all 21 samples collected during the study. The five pharmaceuticals detected were acetaminophen, gabapentin, gemfibrozil, metformin, and oxycodone. Gabapentin (10 of 21 samples) and metformin (8 of 21 samples) were the most commonly detected pharmaceuticals. None of the detected micropollutant concentrations exceeded any Minnesota standards or U.S. Environmental Protection Agency aquatic life benchmarks, except the acute toxicity benchmark for nonvascular plants for atrazine. Two cyanotoxins, anatoxin-a and microcystin, were detected, but concentrations were below U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for swimming or recreation. Notably, total coliform, fecal coliform, and Escherichia coli were detected in all creek samples, and concentrations generally decreased downstream, suggesting contamination potentially occurred upstream from the monument. Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis was not detected in any creek sediment samples but was detected in three water samples from the creek. Three organisms were detected in the 2019 water and mist sampling from Winnewissa Falls. Two of these organisms can cause illness in humans (Cryptosporidium and Legionella), and a third (ruminant Bacteroides) is an indicator of manure contamination. Despite few samples, pathogen-positive water samples and air sampling demonstrated the feasibility and utility of the mist sampling approach outlined in this report.",,,,US Geological Survey,23280328; 2328031X,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169138350

The objective of the research was to reduce organic matter and bacteria in river water using chitosan nanoparticles. The treatment was verified by taking into account the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) as indicators of organic matter and contamination by pathogenic organisms by the level of total coliforms.

This is very important for monitoring water supply to identify and address any potential contaminants as well as investment in infrastructures and treatment technology that can improve water quality. This review aimed to evaluate the quality of drinking water in Ethiopia based on the concentration status of physicochemical and bacteriological parameters and its risk factors. Different studies in most parts of Ethiopia indicated that physicochemical quality of drinking water meet the prescribed standard limit, but in some parts of Ethiopia, water did not meet quality standard. Accordingly, an overall coliform count of drinking water in different areas of Ethiopia indicated that drinking water was at risk. Microbiological implications in the country showed that considerable amounts of drinking water were tainted with E. coli and fecal coliforms, which indicated the existence of dangerous pathogens. The quality issues several parts of Ethiopia were significantly influenced by poor handling practices. Consequently, proper handling practices of drinking water both at the source and point of use is essential to have a safe water supply and thereby protect public health.

Microbial communities in the aquatic environment are groups of microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, and fungi) that share a common living space that can interact in various ways with other aquatic organisms. It is widely accepted that monitoring of microbial community is important for the diagnosis of fish diseases. Many fish diseases, especially those caused by bacteria or viruses, can lead to serious economic losses to fish. FAO reported that good-quality fish should have counts of total coliforms and fecal coliforms which should not exceed 100 and 10CFU/g, respectively. In general, many studies on northern Delta lakes, Egypt, showed bacterial indicators with a higher range than FAO recommendation. The microbiological examination of the water source is absolutely necessary in order to detect the type of bacteria being transferred into the fish. It can serve as a guide to monitoring and protecting fish quality and, consequently, our health. In Egypt, several studies have recorded that some lake fishes are infected internally and externally, with exceptionally high amounts of bacteria at the gills, skin, and intestines. Various infectious diseases, such as photobacteriosis, vibriosis, and streptococcosis, have been detected in several outbreaks in wild and cultured fish confirming that some lake fishes are heavily contaminated and dangerous for human health. There is a need for great efforts and cooperation between the different authorities to protect the lakes from pollution and reduce environmental risks. These efforts can be achieved through the treatment of agricultural and industrial drainage, besides sewage, discharging into lakes through establishing treatment stations or sedimentation basins in order to improve the quality of the lake water and, consequently, the fish’s health. Also, regular assessment of pollutants in the lakes is very essential for lake fish sustainability.",Bacteriat; Egypt; Freshwater Lakes; Fungi; Marine Water Lakes; Virus,,,Elsevier,,9780323955270; 9780323955287,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160180028

Hospital wastewater poses a serious health risk to staff, the public, and the environment. This study was conducted to determine the physical, chemical and biological parameters of hospital wastewater from Mohammed VI University Hospital in Marrakech, which is discharged into the municipal sewage system, where it mixes with sewage from urban areas without prior treatment. This study was conducted between October 2022 and January 2023 with a sampling frequency of 15 days each. Hospital wastewater samples were collected at the main collector of all manholes in the hospital.Physicochemical characterization of the effluents from each department showed that they are heavily polluted with organic matter, with average values in the range of 750 mg/L COD, 512.14 mg/L BOD<inf>5</inf> and 879.86 mg /L TSS. These values are higher than those recommended in the Moroccan discharge standards. Total phosphorus, sulfates, nitrates and nitrites are 5.92 mg/L, 427.97 mg/L, 7.39 mg/L and 0.60 mg/L, respectively. Bacteriological characterization shows that fecal coliform bacteria reach 12×106 CFU/100 mL. These effluents also contain pathogens responsible for nosocomial infections, especially Staphylococcus aureus. The ratio COD /BOD<inf>5</inf> is about 1.46, a value indicating that hospital wastewater is readily biodegradable. Therefore, proper treatment of these hospital effluents is essential due to their physicochemical and pathogenic bacterial load, which can negatively affect public health and carry the risk of spreading epidemic diseases.",Bacteriological Characterization; Hospital Wastewater; Physicochemical Characterization; Population Health,,,Polskie Towarzystwo Inzynierii Ekologicznej (PTIE),27197050,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85159001236

Different technologies are currently in practice to decontaminate the environment and safeguard human health; however, these technologies are chemical consuming and quite expensive thus give rise to secondary pollution and are nonecologically friendly. To conquer these constraints, genetic engineering approaches are significant to design transgenic microorganisms and plants to enrich biodetoxification and biodegradation of environmental pollutants for long-lasting development. Genetically modified organisms provide great possibility for environment remediation. Reuse wastewater to a mark depending upon the dimension of treatment holds some biological and chemical contaminants which are potentially harmful to the exposed population (buy contact by inhalation or by injection). The use of partially treated wastewater for irrigation is helpful in agriculture but might be associated with human health risks. Report from distinct locations globally relates to microbial outbreaks with reuse of wastewater for irrigation. The probability were notable among children and immune-compromised individuals the in immune-competent adults. Primarily skin and intestinal infection were widespread among individuals infected via occupation exposure and injection. Crop contamination with enteric virus bacterial pathogens fecal coliforms and parasite as well as existence of antibiotic Residues and occurrence of antibiotic resistance gene have also been evinced.

Since domestic water is the water most consumed by Lebanese people, cleaning household water tanks is important to prevent their exposure to pathogenic microorganisms. Generally, all the stages of the value chain of the Lebanese water sector are still imperfect. Thus, the domestic water should be regularly tested, especially in the impoverished landmarks where water quality is the worst. The aim of this study is to evaluate the physicochemical parameters and microbiological quality of the water in the storage tanks of homes in Sidon, Lebanon. Fifty water samples were collected aseptically from domestic water storage tanks. The microbiological assessment was performed using basic plating techniques. Identification of isolated bacteria was performed using MALDI-TOF-MS. Physicochemical parameters were assessed using titration, pH, and conductivity measurements. Antibiotic-susceptibility testing was performed using antibiotic disks. Screening for virulence genes in bacteria was carried out via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Most of the physicochemical parameters were within the permissible limits of the World Health Organization (WHO) for drinking water. The heterotrophic plate count (HPC) varied between the water samples. The total coliform, fecal coliform, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) contaminate was 54%, 20%, and 16% in each of the samples, respectively. Other bacteria isolated from household water included intestinal Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (68%), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (68%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (22%). Other predominant isolates recovered from the samples were also identified. The bacterial isolates showed a prevalence of resistance and intermediate resistance against the tested antibiotic agents. Multi-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected in 21% of the collected S. aureus, using cefoxitin agent and mecA gene detection. A prevalence of virulence genes in both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus was also noticed. Our data show that Sidon domestic water is not suitable for either drinking or home applications.",Microbiological Analysis; Pathogenic Bacteria; Physicochemical Parameters; Virulence Genes; Water; Antibiotics; Diagnosis; Digital Storage; Escherichia Coli; Genes; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Potable Water; Quality Control; Water Tanks; Domestic Water; Household Water; Lebanon; Microbiological Analysis; Pathogenic Bacterium; Physico - Chemical Parameters; Staphylococcus Aureus; Virulence Gene; Water Samples; Water Storage Tanks; Water Quality; Antibiotic Resistance; Bacterium; Disease Prevalence; Gene Expression; Microbiology; Physicochemical Property; Water Treatment; Liban Sud; Sidon,Antibiotics; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Escherichia coli; Genes; Polymerase chain reaction; Potable water; Quality control; Water tanks; Domestic water; Household water; Lebanon; Microbiological analysis; Pathogenic bacterium; Physico - chemical parameters; Staphylococcus aureus; Virulence gene; Water samples; Water storage tanks; Water quality; antibiotic resistance; bacterium; disease prevalence; gene expression; microbiology; physicochemical property; water treatment; Liban Sud; Sidon,,MDPI,20734441,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146818802

The consumption of microbiologically contaminated drinking water has been reported to cause diarrhoea, mortality, and morbidity in children under the age of five years. This study evaluated the microbiological pathogens detected in municipal drinking water and diarrhoea trends for children under 5 years of age in South Africa between 2008 and 2018. A trends analysis study was conducted using secondary data on diarrhoea for children under the age of five years and microbial drinking water quality compliance. A negative correlation was found between the occurrence of microbial pathogens in water, morbidity, and mortality rates of children under the age of 5 years in South Africa. As compliance status improved, the mortality rate among children under 5 years old decreased by 31% over the study period. A conclusion can thus be drawn that the microbiological pathogens detected in drinking water at levels complying with SANS 241:2015 Edition 2 standards and diarrhoea incidences were not the primary cause of the mortality of children under 5 years old in South Africa between 2008 and 2018.","Child Mortality And Morbidity Rates; Children; Compliance Status; Diarrhoea; Microbiological Water Quality; Sanitation; South Africa; Water Quality; Drinking Water; Drinking Water; Child Health; Hygiene; Mortality; Sanitation; Water Quality; Article; Case Fatality Rate; Child; Childhood Mortality; Dehydration; Diarrhea; Escherichia Coli; Fecal Coliform; Human; Morbidity; Mortality Rate; Preschool Child; Protozoon; South Africa; Trend Study; Infant; Water Supply; Child; Child, Preschool; Diarrhea; Drinking Water; Humans; Infant; Morbidity; Sanitation; Water Quality; Water Supply","drinking water; child health; hygiene; mortality; sanitation; water quality; Article; case fatality rate; child; childhood mortality; dehydration; diarrhea; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; human; morbidity; mortality rate; preschool child; protozoon; South Africa; trend study; infant; water supply; Child; Child, Preschool; Diarrhea; Drinking Water; Humans; Infant; Morbidity; Sanitation; Water Quality; Water Supply",,MDPI,16604601; 16617827,,,36612920,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145972704

The aim of this study was to assess physicochemical and microbial quality of drinking water stored in slum households of Hawassa City, Ethiopia. Cross-sectional study was conducted and a total of 120 water samples were collected from 60 households (60 tap, 60 households) to test the quality. Wagtech Potalab + PTW − 1000 was used to test the parameters. Physicochemical parameters—temperature, turbidity, pH and residual free chlorine were measured. Presence of total and faecal coliform bacteria was tested using the Wagtech membrane filtration procedure. Heads of the households were asked about the case of diarrhoeal diseases in any of their family members. Data were statistically analysed and compared with World Health Organization (WHO) standards. Paired t test was used to analyse the mean difference between tap and household water samples. Binary logistic regression was used to investigate any significant association between presence of faecal coliform in the water samples and occurrence of diarrhoeal diseases. Eight (13.3%) tap and 28 (46.7%) household water samples were found positive for total coliform; five (8.3%) tap and 19 (31.7%) household water samples were positive for faecal coliform. Eleven (18.3%) household water samples had faecal coliform 10–100 CFU/100 ml, which falls under high-risk category based on WHO standard. The paired t test (p < 0.05) showed significant mean difference between faecal coliform count of the tap and household water samples. The binary logistic regression analysis implied the odds for occurrence of diarrhoeal disease is 17.33 more in households with positive faecal coliform results (p < 0.05). It is concluded that there was a significant level of faecal contamination of drinking water at the household level.

E. coli concentrations in the floating villages (3.6 × 103 and 5.7 × 103 CFU/100 mL during the low- and high-water seasons, respectively) were significantly higher than those in other lake sites (4.0 × 101 and 7.0 × 100 CFU/100 mL during the low- and high-water seasons, respectively) and rivers (3.3 × 102 and 8.9 × 102 CFU/100 mL during the low- and high-water seasons, respectively), most likely because fecal materials from the boathouses were discharged without treatment. At most of the lake sampling sites remote from the boathouses, the E. coli concentration was lower during the high-water season than that during the low-water season, due to dilution by lake water. E. coli colonies detected during monitoring were isolated for pathotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, beta-lactamase gene detection, and multilocus sequencing typing (MLST). Of the 659 E. coli isolates, 101 (15.3%) were diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC). The prevalence of DEC (52.2%) in the floating villages during the low-water season was higher than that during the high-water season (4.2%) and that in other sites during both seasons (10.6–21.3%). The DEC isolates from the floating villages during the low-water season showed high antimicrobial resistance, including ampicillin (83.4%) and ciprofloxacin (83.4%), and frequently possessed a beta-lactamase gene (bla<inf>TEM</inf>) (83.4%). MLST analysis indicated that the predominant sequence type (ST) of DEC isolates from the floating villages possibly originated from humans, whereas more diverse STs were detected in isolates from other sites. We revealed the wide presence of diarrheagenic and antimicrobial-resistant E. coli in Tonle Sap Lake and identified a considerable infection risk in floating villages, especially during the low-water season.","Diarrheagenic Escherichia Coli; Esbl Genotypes; Fecal Contamination; Floating Village; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Tonle Sap Lake; Amoxicillin; Ampicillin; Aztreonam; Cefotaxime; Cefoxitin; Chloramphenicol; Ciprofloxacin; Cotrimoxazole; Imipenem; Piperacillin Plus Tazobactam; Tetracycline; Beta Lactamase; Water; Anti-bacterial Agents; Beta-lactamases; Water; Contamination; Genes; Geographical Distribution; Lakes; River Pollution; Rural Areas; Diarrheagenic Escherichia Coli; E.

Effluents arising from human and animal gut microbiomes highly influence water quality. Wastewater pollution is, therefore, frequently monitored using bacterial indicators (BI). However, threats to public health arise from the frequent incidence of wastewater-mediated viral infections–undetected by BI. Moreover, the enteric viromes contaminating wastewater are characterized by high abundance, genetic diversity and persistence in various water environments. Furthermore, humans usually suffer a minimum of a single acute diarrheal episode over their lifetime arising from extraneously acquired enteric microbiomes. A wide range of management methods are employed—in particular, microbial source tracking (MST) approaches to confront infections arising from exposure to contaminated wastewater. This review elaborates the viral contamination of treated wastewater and associated public health issues. Latterly, we discuss the various management strategies of wastewater pollution using conventional fecal indicators, viral indicators and human viral surrogates, with particular interest in the pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV). Globally, PMMoV has been detected in rivers, aquifers, irrigation systems, and coastal and marine waters at high prevalence rates and concentrations greater than 105 genome copies per liter (gc/L). PMMoV was also found in almost all untreated wastewater environments. PMMoV concentrations in wastewater vary from 103 to 107 gc/L. These values are more than the maximum recorded viral indicator concentrations in wastewater for other proposed indicators. Limited variability in the daily concentrations of PMMoV in fecal wastewater has been studied, with an estimated average concentration of 105 gc/L with insignificant seasonal variability.

This study aimed to evaluate the presence of this virus in natural and drinking water over one year of monitoring (2021). A survey of viral RNA was carried out by RT-qPCR in concentrated samples of surface water, groundwater, and drinking water from different regions of Portugal. SARS-CoV-2 RNA—quantified in genomic copies per liter (gc/L) of sampled water—was not detected in groundwater, but was detected and quantified in samples of surface water (two out of 43; 8035 and 23,757 gc/L) and in drinking water (one out of 43 samples; 7463 gc/L). The study also detected and quantified Norovirus RNA, intending to confirm the use of this enteric virus to assess variations in fecal matter throughout the sampling campaign. The samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA also had the highest concentrations of Norovirus RNA—including the drinking water sample, which proved negative for fecal enteric bacteria (FIB). These results indicate that, to protect human health, it is advisable to continue monitoring these viruses, and noroviruses as fecal indicators (FI) as well—especially in low-flow water bodies that receive wastewater.",Fecal Indicator (fi); Human Health; Norovirus; Risk Assessment; Rt-qpcr; Water Monitoring; Water Safety; Activated Carbon; Ozone; Qiaamp Rna Mini; Activated Carbon; Drinking Water; Ground Water; Ozone; Surface Water; Virus Rna; Article; Chlorination; Cycle Threshold Value; Dam (barrier); Disease Surveillance; Disinfection; Enteric Virus; Enterobacteriaceae; Feces; Flocculation; Flotation; Oxidation; Quantitative Analysis; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Risk Assessment; Rna Extraction; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Wastewater; Water Filtration; Water Monitoring; Water Sampling; Water Supply,activated carbon; drinking water; ground water; ozone; surface water; virus RNA; Article; chlorination; cycle threshold value; dam (barrier); disease surveillance; disinfection; enteric virus; Enterobacteriaceae; feces; flocculation; flotation; oxidation; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; risk assessment; RNA extraction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; wastewater; water filtration; water monitoring; water sampling; water supply,,MDPI,20760817,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85140630910

Mn exposure can lead to neurodegenerative diseases resembling Parkinson's disease, and has become a major public health concern. However, the mechanism of Mn-induced neurotoxicity in the brain is not clear. Fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) may alleviate the neurotoxicity of Mn exposure by remodeling the gut microbiota. In this study, MnCl<inf>2</inf> (manganese chloride) was administered to mice as in drinking water (Mn: 200 mg/L), and fecal matter from donor mice was administered by oral gavage every other day to the recipient mice. The Mn exposure model (Mn group) and FMT model (Mn+FMT group) were established and analyzed 5 weeks post-exposure. The Wipi1 gene exhibited the most significant increase associated with Mn exposure and Mn+FMT treatment groups based on transcriptome analysis. Combined analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics demonstrated that the apelin signaling pathway is the main pathway affected by FMT during Mn exposure. Immunofluorescence and Western blot showed that the expression of key proteins (Beclin-1, LC-3B, and PINK1) associated with autophagy in the hippocampus was robustly activated in the Mn exposure group, but attenuation was observed in Mn+FMT mice, suggesting a critical role of autophagy in neurotoxicity induced by Mn exposure. Our research provides evidence for the neurotoxic effects of Mn exposure through autophagy activation and provides an underlying mechanism of FMT protection against Mn-induced neurotoxicity through regulation of the apelin signaling pathway.",Autophagy; Cgas–sting Pathway; Fecal Microbiome Transplantation; Manganese; Neurotoxicity; Cyclic Gmp Dependent Protein Kinase; Manganese; Manganese Chloride; Protein; Apelin; Manganese; Apelin; Beclin 1; Cyclic Gmp Dependent Protein Kinase; Drinking Water; Lc 3b Protein; Manganese; Manganese Chloride; Pink1 Protein; Protein; Proteome; Transcriptome; Unclassified Drug; Experimental Study; Fecal Coliform; Inhibition; Microbiology; Physiological Response; Rodent; Animal Cell; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Article; Autophagy (cellular); Brain Tissue; Controlled Study; Fecal Microbiota Transplantation; Gene; Hippocampus; Immunofluorescence; Male; Manganism; Mouse; Multiomics; Neuroprotection; Nonhuman; Protein Analysis; Protein Expression; Proteomics; Rna Analysis; Signal Transduction; Transcription Regulation; Transcriptomics; Western Blotting; Wipi1 Gene; Animal; Autophagy; Brain; Toxicity And Intoxication; Animals; Apelin; Autophagy; Brain; Fecal Microbiota Transplantation; Manganese; Mice; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Signal Transduction,apelin; beclin 1; cyclic GMP dependent protein kinase; drinking water; LC 3B protein; manganese; manganese chloride; PINK1 protein; protein; proteome; transcriptome; unclassified drug; experimental study; fecal coliform; inhibition; microbiology; physiological response; rodent; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autophagy (cellular); brain tissue; controlled study; fecal microbiota transplantation; gene; hippocampus; immunofluorescence; male; manganism; mouse; multiomics; neuroprotection; nonhuman; protein analysis; protein expression; proteomics; RNA analysis; signal transduction; transcription regulation; transcriptomics; Western blotting; Wipi1 gene; animal; autophagy; brain; toxicity and intoxication; Animals; Apelin; Autophagy; Brain; Fecal Microbiota Transplantation; Manganese; Mice; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Signal Transduction,,Academic Press,01476513; 10902414,,EESAD,35917710,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85135546481

Despite SARS-CoV-2 being an enveloped virus, which is highly susceptible to environmental conditions (temperature, solar/UV exposure). This review provides insight into the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to contaminate groundwater through burial sites, the impact of various types of burial practices on SARS-CoV-2 survival, and current knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to ensure that humans and ecosystems are adequately protected from SARS-CoV-2. Data available shows temperature is still likely to be the driving factor when it comes to survival and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Research conducted at cemetery sites globally using various bacteriophages (MS2, PRD1, faecal coliforms) and viruses (TGEV, MHV) as surrogates for pathogenic enteric viruses to study the fate and transport of these viruses showed considerable contamination of groundwater, particularly where there is a shallow vadose zone and heterogeneous structures are known to exist with very low residence times. In addition, changes in solution chemistry (e.g., decrease in ionic strength or increase in pH) during rainfall events produces large pulses of released colloids that can result in attached viruses becoming remobilised, with implications for groundwater contamination. Viruses cannot spread unaided through the vadose zone. Since groundwater is too deep to be in contact with the interred body and migration rates are very slow, except where preferential flow paths are known to exist, the groundwater table will not be significantly impacted by contamination from SARS-CoV-2. When burial takes place using scientifically defensible methods the possibility of infection will be highly improbable. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has helped us to prepare for other eventualities such as natural disasters where mass fatalities and subsequently burials may take place in a relatively short space of time.",Cemetery; Covid-19; Groundwater; Pathogens; Sars-cov-2; Vadose Zone; Viruses; Cadaverine; Chlorine; Chlorine Dioxide; Hydroxyapatite; Hypochlorite Sodium; Putrescine; Contamination; Critical Infrastructures; Disasters; Groundwater; Groundwater Flow; Groundwater Pollution; Health Risks; Ionic Strength; Public Works; 'current; Burial Sites; Cemetery; Enveloped Virus; Environmental Conditions; Groundwater As; Knowledge Gaps; Risk To Human Health; Uv Exposure; Vadose Zone; Coronavirus; Covid-19; Cadaverine; Chlorine; Chlorine Dioxide; Ground Water; Hydroxyapatite; Hypochlorite Sodium; Putrescine; Rain; Concentration (composition); Groundwater; Groundwater Pollution; Health Risk; Pathogen; Risk Assessment; Vadose Zone; Algorithm; Bacillus; Bacteriophage; Burial; Clostridium; Cultural Factor; Decomposition; Economic Aspect; Enterococcus; Enterococcus Faecalis; Escherichia Coli; Fecal Coliform; Fecal Oral Transmission; Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus; Geotechnical Engineering; Human Poliovirus 1; Landfill; Microbial Contamination; Migration; Moisture; Murine Hepatitis Virus; Nonhuman; Pandemic; Ph; Porosity; Protein Denaturation; Pseudomonas; Residential Area; Review; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Staphylococcus Aureus; Survival Rate; Temperature; Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus; Ultraviolet Radiation; Viral Contamination; Virus Inactivation; Virus Infectivity; Virus Survival; Wastewater; Water Contamination; Water Quality; Ecosystem; Human; Virus; Burial; Ecosystem; Humans; Sars-cov-2; Viruses,Contamination; Critical infrastructures; Disasters; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Groundwater pollution; Health risks; Ionic strength; Public works; 'current; Burial sites; Cemetery; Enveloped virus; Environmental conditions; Groundwater as; Knowledge gaps; Risk to human health; UV exposure; Vadose Zone; Coronavirus; COVID-19; cadaverine; chlorine; chlorine dioxide; ground water; hydroxyapatite; hypochlorite sodium; putrescine; rain; concentration (composition); groundwater; groundwater pollution; health risk; pathogen; risk assessment; vadose zone; algorithm; Bacillus; bacteriophage; burial; Clostridium; cultural factor; decomposition; economic aspect; Enterococcus; Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; fecal oral transmission; Feline infectious peritonitis virus; geotechnical engineering; Human poliovirus 1; landfill; microbial contamination; migration; moisture; Murine hepatitis virus; nonhuman; pandemic; pH; porosity; protein denaturation; Pseudomonas; residential area; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Staphylococcus aureus; survival rate; temperature; Transmissible gastroenteritis virus; ultraviolet radiation; viral contamination; virus inactivation; virus infectivity; virus survival; wastewater; water contamination; water quality; ecosystem; human; virus; Burial; Ecosystem; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Viruses,,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,35469872,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129630487

However, the presence of the above symptoms does not always indicate the presence of human enteroviruses. It is critical to understand human enteroviruses in water. Human enteroviruses may withstand changing environmental conditions and persist in during extended periods of time in the environment, becoming the cause of diarrheal diseases. As a result, human pathogenic viruses are increasingly likely to emerge as important warning indicators of water scarcity. Human adenoviruses and other viruses have been recommended as potential indicators for high-quality detection of human-origin organisms that contaminate water systems. The study included measuring the water pollution of the Euphrates River in the cities of Hilla and Kufa by taking water samples in different seasons and locations to determine the extent of pollution, as well as determining the most likely number of fecal coliform bacteria through a series of tests where the highest result was for the total number of aerobic bacteria for the Hilla samples for the site The third was in October, which reached (194C/ml), as well as the Kufa samples in October reached the highest percentage in the third site, which amounted to about (114 C/ml). As for fecal coliform bacteria in Hilla samples, the highest percentage was in October in the third site (450 °C/100 ml), while in Kufa samples, the highest percentage was in the third site in December (210 °C/100 ml). Take a sample of water and plant it in a different medium. Bacteria were grown in Petri dishes and cultured on MacConkey agar medium to see the fermented colonies showing that a large proportion of the colonies ferment due to lactose fermentation. Water samples were also grown on Eosin-methylene Blue Agar, a medium used to differentiate between lactose-free fermented bacteria and non-lactose-fermenting bacteria. and is only interested in Gram-negative Lactobacilli that digest lactose: Non-lactose-fermenting bacteria such as Salmonella and Shigella appear as clear, colorless colonies. When E. coli bacteria colonies were detected and medications were tested, a high level of resistance to these treatments was revealed, highlighting the need of cleaning this water since it would have a significant impact on human health.",Colitotal; Faecal Coliformscoliphages; Virusese; Water Quality,,,Institute of Physics,17551307; 17551315,,,,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141511937

Quantifying relationships between land use, chemical parameters, and fecal bacterial concentrations in watersheds can help guide the monitoring and control of microbial water quality and explain seasonal differences. The goals of this study were to (i) identify seasonal differences in Escherichia coli and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron concentrations, (ii) evaluate environmental drivers influencing microbial contamination during baseflow, snowmelt, and summer rain seasons, and (iii) relate seasonal changes in B. thetaiotaomicron to anticipated gastrointestinal infection risks. Water chemistry data collected during three hydroclimatic seasons from 64 Michigan watersheds were analyzed using seasonal linear regression models with candidate variables including crop and land use proportions, prior precipitation, chemical parameters, and variables related to both wastewater treatment and septic usage. Adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) linear regression with bootstrapping was used to select explanatory variables and estimate coefficients. Regardless of season, wastewater treatment plant and septic system usage were consistently selected in all primary models for B. thetaiotaomicron and E. coli. Chemistry and precipitation-related variable selection depended upon season and organism.

For this purpose, ground water samples were collected from Mangrotha, Sokar, BastiBuzdar, KotQaisrani, JhokeBodo, Litra, Vehova, Bohar, MakwalKalan, Bindi, Dona, NariJanubi, TibbiQaisrani, Morejhangi, Babbi, Nutkani, JaluWali, Lakhani, Kotani and Chulani and bacteriologically characterized. The results revealed a significant increase in bacterial counts. Bacterial infections such as Fecal Coliforms and E.Coli had extraordinarily high concentrations, ranging from 25 CFU/mL to 50 CFU/mL and 2.5 CFU/mL to 3.5 CFU/mL, respectively. The levels of all other parameters were within WHO's acceptable ranges. A survey was also done to assess the impact of drinking water on city inhabitants' fitness. Globally, 780 million people, and 100 million people in Pakistan are exposed to insecure water sources. To estimate the health threat of infected water, a total of 160 residents interviewed. The information acquired from this field work will reveal a high prevalence of suspected water borne diseases like diarrhea, nausea & vomiting, gastrointestinal issues, Skin Rash, Skin irritation, Diabetes, Neural diseases, Renal dysfunction, Cholera, malaria, prolonged fever, Cancer, Hepatitis and jaundice. To resolve water and environmental problems, consciousness and regular monitoring programs of water organization and safe removal of waste was proposed.

However, most of the studies are often inadequately carried out because they lack systematic studies reports bioaerosols emission characteristics and health risk assessments for these three enteric bacteria during seasonal variation. Therefore, quantitative microbial risk assessment based on Monte Carlo simulation was utilized in this research to assess the seasonal variations of health risks of the three enteric bioaerosols among exposure populations (academic visitors, field engineers, and office staffs) in a WWTP equipped with rotating-disc and microporous aeration modes. The results show that the concentrations of the three airborne bacteria from the rotating-disc aeration mode were 2–7 times higher than the microporous aeration mode. Field engineers had health risks 1.5 times higher than academic visitors due to higher exposure frequency. Health risks of airborne Enterococcus in summer were up to 3 times higher than those in spring and winter. Similarly, health risks associated to E. coli aerosol exposure were 0.3 times higher in summer compared to spring. In contrast, health risks associated with fecal coliform aerosol were between 2 and 19 times lower in summer compared to spring and winter seasons. Data further suggest that wearing of N95 mask could minimize health risks by 1–2 orders of magnitude. This research shed light on seasonal variation of health risks associated with bioaerosol emission from wastewater utilities.",Annual Probability Of Infection; Disease Burden; Emission Characteristics; Enteric Bacteria Bioaerosols; Monte Carlo Simulation; Alcohol; Aerosols; Waste Water; Alcohol; Aerosol; Bacterium; Computer Simulation; Emission; Fecal Coliform; Monte Carlo Analysis; Probability; Quantitative Analysis; Risk Assessment; Seasonal Variation; Wastewater Treatment Plant; Aeration; Airborne Bacterium; Article; Colony Forming Unit; Disease Burden; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterococcus; Escherichia Coli; Health Hazard; Infection; Laboratory Test; Monte Carlo Method; Nonhuman; Respiratory Droplets And Aerosols; Spring; Summer; Waste Water Treatment Plant; Wastewater; Gram Negative Bacterium; Human; Intestine Flora; Microbiology; Season; Water Management; Aerosols; Air Microbiology; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gram-negative Bacteria; Humans; Risk Assessment; Seasons; Waste Water; Water Purification,alcohol; aerosol; bacterium; computer simulation; emission; fecal coliform; Monte Carlo analysis; probability; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; seasonal variation; wastewater treatment plant; aeration; airborne bacterium; Article; colony forming unit; disease burden; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterococcus; Escherichia coli; health hazard; infection; laboratory test; Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; respiratory droplets and aerosols; spring; summer; waste water treatment plant; wastewater; Gram negative bacterium; human; intestine flora; microbiology; season; water management; Aerosols; Air Microbiology; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Humans; Risk Assessment; Seasons; Waste Water; Water Purification,,Academic Press,01476513; 10902414,,EESAD,35636240,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85131043146

The water quality of Punnakayal estuary in the Thamirabarani River system from the south India, a vital source of water for drinking and domestic purposes, industrial usage, and irrigation was assessed here. A comparitive assessment of physico-chemical variables (pH, EC, TDS, DO, BOD, turbidity and NO<inf>3</inf>), microbiological parameters (total coliform bacteria, fecal coliform bacteria, fecal streptococci and escherichia coli) and toxic metals (As, Cr, Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) suggested a decrease of 20% in the contaminant ratio during the lockdown period in comparison to the pre-lockdown period. The Health risk assessment models (HQ, HI, and TCR) highlighted carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic hazards for both children and adults through the ingestion and dermal adsorption exposures. The HI values for both As and Cr exceeded the acceptable limit (>1) during the lockdown period, but the potential risk for children and adults remained low in compaisio with the pre-lockdown period. Our results suggested that the Thamirabarani River system remained hostile to human health even during the lockdown period, and it requires regular monitoring through a volunteer water quality committee with private and government participations.","Covid-19 Pandemic; Health Risk Hazard; India; Toxic Metals; Water Quality; Arsenic; Chromium; Copper; Iron; Zinc; Metals, Heavy; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Escherichia Coli; Health; Health Hazards; Heavy Metals; Potable Water; Risk Assessment; River Pollution; Rivers; Water Quality; Water Supply; Carcinogenics; Covid-19 Pandemic; Health Risk Hazard; Heavy Metal Contamination; Human Health Risk Assessment; India; Pathogenic Contamination; River Systems; South India; Toxic Metals; Health Risks; Arsenic; Chromium; Copper; Dissolved Oxygen; Heavy Metal; Iron; Surface Water; Zinc; Covid-19; Drinking Water; Estuarine Sediment; Estuary; Health Risk; Public Health; Risk Assessment; Water Quality; Article; Atomic Absorption Spectrometry; Contamination; Electric Conductivity; Health Risk Assessment; Heavy Metal Poisoning; Human; Most Probable Number; Ph; Physical Chemistry; Turbidity; Adult; Child; Communicable Disease Control; Environmental Monitoring; Epidemiology; Pandemic; River; Water Pollutant; Tamil Nadu; Thamirabarani River; Adult; Child; Communicable Disease Control; Environmental Monitoring; Estuaries; Heavy Metal Poisoning; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Pandemics; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Escherichia coli; Health; Health hazards; Heavy metals; Potable water; Risk assessment; River pollution; Rivers; Water quality; Water supply; Carcinogenics; COVID-19 pandemic; Health risk hazard; Heavy metal contamination; Human health risk assessment; India; Pathogenic contamination; River systems; South India; Toxic metals; Health risks; arsenic; chromium; copper; dissolved oxygen; heavy metal; iron; surface water; zinc; COVID-19; drinking water; estuarine sediment; estuary; health risk; public health; risk assessment; water quality; Article; atomic absorption spectrometry; contamination; electric conductivity; health risk assessment; heavy metal poisoning; human; most probable number; pH; physical chemistry; turbidity; adult; child; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; pandemic; river; water pollutant; Tamil Nadu; Thamirabarani River; Adult; Child; Communicable Disease Control; Environmental Monitoring; Estuaries; Heavy Metal Poisoning; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Pandemics; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,Elsevier Ltd,00456535; 18791298,,CMSHA,35301998,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85126554991

In an attempt to partly fill this knowledge gap, we assessed the potential public health impact of bioaerosols near open waste canals (OWCs) using Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA). We used data acquired in La Paz, Bolivia to characterize the risk of disease that aerosolized enteric pathogens may pose through food, fomites and inhalation (all followed by ingestion). Three reference pathogens were selected to conduct the assessment: enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Shigella flexneri, and Campylobacter jejuni. Inhalation followed by ingestion had the highest median infection risk per event i.e. 3 × 10−5 (3 infections for every 100,000 exposures), compared to contaminated food e.g. 5 × 10−6 and fomites e.g. 2 × 10−7, all for C. jejuni infections. Our sensitivity analysis showed that bacterial fluxes from the air were the most influential factor on risk. Our results suggest that fecal bacterial aerosols from OWCs present non-negligible risks of infection in La Paz, with median annual infection risks by C. jejuni being 18 (food), and 100 (inhalation) times greater than the EPA's standard for drinking water (1 × 10−4).

However, it has been unclear whether it functions adequately also in colder climates. To investigate this issue, SODIS experiments were performed in the humid continental climate of Finland by exposing faecally contaminated drinking water to natural solar radiation at different water temperatures (8–23 °C) and UV intensities (12–19 W/m2) in polyethylene (PE) bags. To establish an adequate benchmark, SODIS experiments with the same experimental design were additionally conducted in the Mediterranean climate of Spain in typical conditions of SODIS application (~39 °C and 42 W/m2). Out of all experiments, the highest coliform and enterococci inactivation efficiencies in terms of lowest required doses for 4-log disinfection (25 Wh/m2 and 60 Wh/m2, respectively) were obtained in humid continental climate at the lowest studied mean water temperature (8–11 °C). Despite the low mean UV irradiance (~19 Wh/m2), 4-log disinfection of coliforms and enterococci were also reached fast in these conditions (1 h 27 min and 3 h 18 min, respectively). Overall, the doses required for disinfection increased as the water temperatures and UV intensities of the experiments rose. Disinfection of 4-logs (> 99.99%) of both bacteria was reached in all SODIS experiments within 6 h, suggesting SODIS could be a sufficient household water treatment method also in colder climates, unlike previously thought. The effects of different water temperatures on bacterial inactivation were also tested in the absence of sunlight. Together the obtained results indicate that while water temperatures below or close to the optima of coliforms and enterococci (~10 °C) alone do not cause inactivation, these temperatures may enhance SODIS performance. This phenomenon is attributed to slower bacterial metabolism and hence slower photorepair induced by the low water temperature.",Emergency Water Purification; Frugal Technologies; Household Water Treatment And Safe Storage (hwts); Low Temperature Disinfection; Sodis; Waterborne Disease; Polyethylene; Drinking Water; Benchmarking; Design Of Experiments; Disinfection; Potable Water; Tropics; Water Treatment; Emergency Water Purification; Frugal Technology; Household Water; Household Water Treatment And Safe Storage; Low Temperature Disinfection; Lows-temperatures; Safe Storage; Solar Disinfection; Water Purification; Water-borne Disease; Temperature; Drinking Water; Polyethylene; Climate; Disinfection; Fecal Coliform; Purification; Solar Radiation; Water Treatment; Waterborne Disease; Antibiotic Resistance; Article; Bacterial Count; Cold Climate; Coliform Bacterium; Controlled Study; Enterococcus; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Impact; Feces Microflora; Finland; Humidity; Low Temperature; Lowest Income Group; Nonhuman; Southern Europe; Spain; Species Cultivation; Sunlight; Ultraviolet Radiation; Water Disinfection; Water Pollution; Water Temperature; Bacterium; Microbiology; Procedures; Water Management; Bacteria; Cold Climate; Drinking Water; Sunlight; Water Microbiology; Water Purification,Benchmarking; Design of experiments; Disinfection; Potable water; Tropics; Water treatment; Emergency water purification; Frugal technology; Household water; Household water treatment and safe storage; Low temperature disinfection; Lows-temperatures; Safe storage; Solar disinfection; Water purification; Water-borne disease; Temperature; drinking water; polyethylene; climate; disinfection; fecal coliform; purification; solar radiation; water treatment; waterborne disease; antibiotic resistance; Article; bacterial count; cold climate; coliform bacterium; controlled study; Enterococcus; environmental exposure; environmental impact; feces microflora; Finland; humidity; low temperature; lowest income group; nonhuman; Southern Europe; Spain; species cultivation; sunlight; ultraviolet radiation; water disinfection; water pollution; water temperature; bacterium; microbiology; procedures; water management; Bacteria; Cold Climate; Drinking Water; Sunlight; Water Microbiology; Water Purification,,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,35218818,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125838244

As a result, the management of biofilms within waterlines has always concerned medical and dental professionals. In February 2020, an internal audit identified the high bacterial counts within the DUWLs at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi and this paper discusses a pragmatic approach to improving the water quality of DUWLs. A three-person committee was developed and the area for improvement was identified as the contaminated DUWLs. Distilled water samples from two dental units were first assessed as baseline in July 2020. The process changes were then implemented which included daily flushing of the dental unit waterlines and € shock treatment' using A-dec ICX capsules. Subsequently, the units were tested after intervention on 24 August 2020 and water from all 16 dental units assessed on 20 November 2020 and again on 22 April 2021. The samples from all the dental units assessed showed marked reduction in bacterial counts and compliance with the Centers for Disease Control guidelines after intervention. All the dental units showed minimal bacterial counts; however, a slightly low pH was noted in the final round of water testing. DUWLs are heavily contaminated with microbes and pose potential risk both to the patient as well as the DHCPs. This study suggests that chemical disinfection using A-dec ICX tablets and flushing as an effective method of reducing the bacterial load in DUWLs.",Patient Safety; Pdsa; Quality Improvement; Quality Improvement Methodologies; Icx; Disinfectant Agent; Distilled Water; Drinking Water; Icx; Tap Water; Article; Bacterial Count; Bacterial Infection; Coliform Bacterium; Controlled Study; Cost Effectiveness Analysis; Escherichia Coli; Fecal Coliform; Infection Control; Nonhuman; Patient Safety; Plan Do Study Act; Practice Guideline; Total Quality Management; Water Disinfection; Water Quality; Water Sampling; Water Supply; Water Treatment; Biofilm; Disinfection; Human; Medical Device Contamination; Microbiology; Procedures; Biofilms; Disinfection; Equipment Contamination; Humans; Quality Improvement; Water Microbiology,disinfectant agent; distilled water; drinking water; icx; tap water; Article; bacterial count; bacterial infection; coliform bacterium; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; infection control; nonhuman; patient safety; Plan Do Study Act; practice guideline; total quality management; water disinfection; water quality; water sampling; water supply; water treatment; biofilm; disinfection; human; medical device contamination; microbiology; procedures; Biofilms; Disinfection; Equipment Contamination; Humans; Quality Improvement; Water Microbiology,,BMJ Publishing Group,23996641,,,35667705,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85131345647

The current outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) call for maintaining safe drinking water supply and providing assessment tools of drinking water quality to avoid contamination in water sources or distribution networks. Arid environmental conditions also add more stress on supplied water to mass gathering events. Herein, we assess the quality of the water supply (desalinated 95% and groundwater 5%) in Makkah city, Saudi Arabia during a mass gathering event in 2019 (9.6 million people) for religious purposes. Fifty five samples were randomly collected from nine different districts of Makkah city, analyzed for TDS, turbidity, pH, EC, free Cl<inf>2</inf>, Al, Cd, Pb, Cr, F, major ions, coliform and E.coli bacteria and were finally used to estimate the water quality index (WQI). Major ions, trace elements and heavy metals analyses show values below permissible limits in most of the samples, while a few samples show slightly higher values. No bacterial count found in any sample. WQI values of all fifty-five samples were below 50 and were identified as “excellent water”. The WQI variations could be attributed to the distribution network conditions rather than a direct impact of adding groundwater with uncontrolled chemical composition. The use of WQI to report the quality of water during mass gathering events to governmental authorities has been proved to be beneficial and should be applied for further mass gathering events worldwide.",Arid Conditions; Fecal Coliform; Mass Gathering; Physico-chemical; Water Quality Index,,,Elsevier B.V.,10183647,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125230854

Several industries, cities, and townships directly depend on this important river throughout the year. It is highly essential to evaluate its surface water quality, characteristics, and improvement status during the COVID-19 lockdown and unlock phases. The major objectives of the present study are to analyse changing nature of heavy metals (Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Cr, and Fe) and microbial load (TVC, TC, and FC) of river water and to identify heavy metals impact on water quality and human health in pre, during, and after unlocking of COVID-19 lockdown. Here, a total of 33 water samples have been collected in the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and unlock phases. The results showed that decreasing trend of the microbial load was found in the lockdown phase. Heavy metal pollution index (HPI) illustrated that all samples are highly polluted (HPI > 150) during the pre-lockdown phase, while during the lockdown phase; HPI showed that around 54.54% of samples have been positively changed (low pollution level). During the unlock phase, 45.45% of samples were again amplified to the high pollution level. Pearson’s correlation coefficient and hierarchical cluster analysis indicated strong relation among heavy metals with faecal coliform at a 0.05% level of significance. Noncarcinogenic hazard index (HI) shows the higher possibility of health risk (HI > 1) particularly for children in all the phases and during the lockdown phase, 36.36% of samples showed no possible health risk for adults (HI < 1). However, HI of dermal contact showed no possible health risk for children and adults in the assessment periods. This applied research can definitely assist planners and administrators in making effective solutions regarding public health.","Heavy Metals Impact; Hierarchical Cluster Analysis; Microbial Load; Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient; Pollution Index; Metals, Heavy; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Cluster Analysis; Covid-19; Heavy Metal; Pollution Effect; River Pollution; Surface Water; Water Quality; Damodar River; Adult; Child; China; Communicable Disease Control; Environmental Monitoring; Human; Risk Assessment; River; Water Pollutant; Adult; Child; Communicable Disease Control; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Risk Assessment; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical","cluster analysis; COVID-19; heavy metal; pollution effect; river pollution; surface water; water quality; Damodar River; adult; child; China; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; human; risk assessment; river; water pollutant; Adult; Child; Communicable Disease Control; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Risk Assessment; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,09441344; 16147499,,ESPLE,35031982,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123068487

Availability and accessibility of safe water sources are crucial for a country's economic growth. Harvesting of roof runoffs is an alternative source of water used for domestic purposes. However, the quality of harvested rainwater can be affected by roofing materials. This research seeks to assess heavy metals concentration, physicochemical and bacteriological parameters in roof runoffs and estimate the water quality index and health risk these metals pose to consumers. Rainwater samples were collected from Aluzinc, Aluminum, Galvanized, and Asbestos roofing materials within the Ejisu municipality. Rainwater collected directly from the sky was used as control. All runoffs from the four roofing materials recorded Cd, Fe, Cr, turbidity, pH, E.coli, total and fecal coliform levels above WHO limit for drinking water. There was a significant variation in pH, EC, Zn, Cd, Cr, Fe, E. coli, total and fecal coliform levels between control samples and roof runoffs (p < 0.05). The estimated water quality index for runoffs from the four roofing materials exceeded 100 indicating their unsuitability for drinking. Cadmium recorded the highest non-cancer health risk to children and adults in all the roof runoffs. Hazard quotients (HQs) above one were recorded for a child (HQ = 40.1) and an adult (HQ = 13.6) via dermal exposure to Cd in runoff from Aluminum roofing material. Hazard quotient of 9.53 and 4.08 were estimated for a child and an adult respectively via oral exposure to Cd in runoffs from Asbestos roofing material. The estimated cancer risks were above 10−3 for a child and an adult via oral and dermal exposure to Cd in all roof runoffs, suggesting a possible cancer health effect. The study concludes that the four roofing materials impact negatively on the quality of runoffs.","Carcinogenic; Heavy Metal; Non-carcinogenic; Roof Runoff; Water Quality; Aluminum; Asbestos; Cadmium; Chromium; Iron; Zinc; Metals, Heavy; Aluminum; Asbestos; Diseases; Harvesting; Hazards; Health Risks; Heavy Metals; Potable Water; Quality Control; Risk Assessment; Risk Perception; Roofs; Runoff; Carcinogenics; Dermal Exposure; E.

Several health risks are associated with unprotected water sources, such as gastrointestinal infections caused by parasites, viruses, and bacteria. Moreover, antibiotic-resistant bacteria in water sources have become an increasing problem worldwide. This study aimed to evaluate the bacterial pathogens present in water within a rural context in Ecuador, along with the efficiency of black ceramic water filters (BCWFs) as a sustainable household water treatment. We monitored five natural water sources that were used for human consumption in the highlands of Ecuador and analyzed the total coliforms and E. coli before and after BCWF installation. The results indicated a variable bacterial contamination (29–300 colony-forming units/100mL) in all unfiltered samples, and they were considered as high risk for human consumption, but after filtration, no bacteria were present. Moreover, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli with bla<inf>TEM</inf>, bla<inf>CTX-M9</inf>, and bla<inf>CTX-M1</inf> genes, and two E. coli classified in the clonal complex ST10 (ST98) were detected in two of the locations sampled; these strains can severely impact public health. The clonal complex ST10, found in the E. coli isolates, possesses the potential to spread bacteria-resistant genes to humans and animals. The results of the use of BCWFs, however, argue for the filters’ potential impact within those contexts, as the BCWFs completely removed even antibiotic-resistant contaminants from the water.",Black Ceramic Water Filters; Extended-spectrum Β-lactamase; Resistant Bacteria; St10 Clonal Complex; Water Quality; Beta Lactamase; Anti-bacterial Agents; Beta-lactamases; Consumption Behavior; Drinking Water; Fecal Coliform; Health Impact; Health Risk; Public Health; Removal Experiment; Water Quality; Antibiotic Resistance; Article; Bacterial Gene; Bacterial Strain; Bacterial Virulence; Bacterium Contamination; Bacterium Isolation; Blactx M1 Gene; Blactx M9 Gene; Blatem Gene; Coliform Bacterium; Colony Forming Unit; Controlled Study; Ecuador; Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase Producing Escherichia Coli; Fluid Intake; Gene Location; High Risk Population; Human; Low Income Country; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Nonhuman; Rural Area; Water Sampling; Water Supply; Water Treatment; Animal; Ceramics; Escherichia Coli; Escherichia Coli Infection; Genetics; Microbiology; Antiinfective Agent; Beta Lactamase; Animals; Anti-bacterial Agents; Beta-lactamases; Ceramics; Escherichia Coli Infections; Humans,consumption behavior; drinking water; fecal coliform; health impact; health risk; public health; removal experiment; water quality; antibiotic resistance; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; bacterium contamination; bacterium isolation; blaCTX M1 gene; blaCTX M9 gene; blaTEM gene; coliform bacterium; colony forming unit; controlled study; Ecuador; extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Escherichia coli; fluid intake; gene location; high risk population; human; low income country; multilocus sequence typing; nonhuman; rural area; water sampling; water supply; water treatment; animal; ceramics; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli infection; genetics; microbiology; antiinfective agent; beta lactamase; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; beta-Lactamases; Ceramics; Escherichia coli Infections; Humans,,MDPI,16604601; 16617827,,,35457602,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128241814

Results indicate similar maximal pathogen densities in urban flood water samples to those from wastewater treatment plants. Significant positive correlations between risk of G. lamblia infection and severity indices suggest that floods could act as an important source of pathogen transmission in Mexico City.

The present study focuses on the seasonal influence on the vulnerability of urban water in Guwahati, the largest city in North-eastern India, through examining the concurrence of seven PPCPs, five viruses, faecal bacteria and nine metals in surface waters during monsoon (Summer-July 2017) and pre-monsoon (Winter-March 2018). Surface water sampling was carried out at different locations of the Brahmaputra River, its tributary Bharalu River (an unlined urban drain), and Dipor Bill Lake (Ramsar-recognized wetland). Both PPCPs and viruses were at high concentrations (e.g. up to 970 ng L−1 caffeine, 2.5 × 103 copies mL−1 pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV)) at the confluence points of urban drains and the river, while they were mostly undetectable at both upstream and downstream locations, implying strong self-purification ability of the river. All the analysed PPCPs and viruses were at much higher concentrations during pre-monsoon i.e., winter than during monsoon, implying heavy dilution and temperature effect during the monsoon. Overall, PPCPs and viruses were more correlated in monsoon but the risk quotient in the urban tributary was higher in pre-monsoon (e.g. 5061 in pre-monsoon and 1515 in monsoon for caffeine). PMMoV was found to be an excellent faecal pollution indicator due to its prevalence, detectability and specificity in all seasons. Overall, the seasonal fluctuations of the non-enveloped viruses monitored in this study is likely to be relevant for SARS-CoV-2. We contribute to address the literature scarcity pertaining to seasonal variations in the prevalence of viruses and their concurrences with contaminants of emerging concern.","Brahmaputra; Concurrence; Faecal Bacteria; Metal; Pandemic Viruses; Ppcps; Arsenic; Cadmium; Caffeine; Carbamazepine; Chromium; Cobalt; Crotamiton; Lead; Manganese; Nickel; Paracetamol; Theophylline; Zinc; Cosmetics; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Atmospheric Thermodynamics; Bacteria; Caffeine; Diseases; Nutrients; River Pollution; Rivers; Brahmaputra; Concurrence; Fecal Bacteria; Pandemic Virus; Pathogenic Microbial; Pepper Mild Mottle Virus; Pharmaceutical And Personal Care Products; Pre-monsoon; Seasonal Variation; Urban Waters; Viruses; Arsenic; Cadmium; Caffeine; Carbamazepine; Chromium; Cobalt; Crotamiton; Heavy Metal; Lead; Manganese; Nickel; Organic Matter; Paracetamol; Pharmaceutical Vehicles And Additives; Pharmaceuticals And Personal Care Product; Theophylline; Unclassified Drug; Zinc; Cosmetic; Drug; Correlation; Fecal Coliform; Monsoon; Ppcp; Virus; Vulnerability; Article; Cluster Analysis; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Environmental Monitoring; Escherichia Coli; Fluid Intake; India; Monsoon Climate; Nonhuman; Population Abundance; Population Research; Principal Component Analysis; Purification; Risk Assessment; River; Seasonal Variation; Solar Radiation; Summer; Temperature; Urban Area; Virus Inactivation; Water Contamination; Water Pollution; Water Pollution Indicator; Water Quality; Winter; Human; Pandemic; Water Pollutant; Assam; Brahmaputra River; Gauhati; Cosmetics; Covid-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Sars-cov-2; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Bacteria; Caffeine; Diseases; Nutrients; River pollution; Rivers; Brahmaputra; Concurrence; Fecal bacteria; Pandemic virus; Pathogenic microbial; Pepper mild mottle virus; Pharmaceutical and personal care products; Pre-monsoon; Seasonal variation; Urban waters; Viruses; arsenic; cadmium; caffeine; carbamazepine; chromium; cobalt; crotamiton; heavy metal; lead; manganese; nickel; organic matter; paracetamol; pharmaceutical vehicles and additives; pharmaceuticals and personal care product; theophylline; unclassified drug; zinc; cosmetic; drug; correlation; fecal coliform; monsoon; PPCP; virus; vulnerability; Article; cluster analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental monitoring; Escherichia coli; fluid intake; India; monsoon climate; nonhuman; population abundance; population research; principal component analysis; purification; risk assessment; river; seasonal variation; solar radiation; summer; temperature; urban area; virus inactivation; water contamination; water pollution; water pollution indicator; water quality; winter; human; pandemic; water pollutant; Assam; Brahmaputra River; Gauhati; Cosmetics; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Pharmaceutical Preparations; SARS-CoV-2; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,34902398,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123293048

This research was carried out to identify coliforms in drinking water and to understand the importance of the int1 gene of coliforms in the spread of resistance to bacterial antibiotics through consumption of contaminated water. A total of 31 drinking water samples were collected from restaurants (n = 18), health center (n = 9), and residences (n = 4) located in Chattogram City, Bangladesh. The isolation and identification of coliforms was performed on selective media with a combination of biochemical and molecular analysis. PCR amplification of the LacZ, uidA and int1 genes was carried out for the identification of the coliform and fecal coliform and antibiotic resistant gene, respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed according to the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method with McFarland standard against three selective antibiotics including co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and ampicillin. Of 31 drinking water samples, coliforms were detected within 32% (n = 10) of the water samples, nine samples were collected in restaurants and one sample in a residence. But no coliform was detected in the drinking water of the health center. Among the identified coliforms, the prevalence of fecal coliforms and the int1 gene was 60% (n = 6) and 40% (n = 4), relatively. All isolates containing the int1 microbial-resistance gene were resistant to ampicillin.This study shows that drinking water consumed in different restaurants located in Chattogram, Bangladesh is contaminated by antibiotic-resistant gene bearing coliforms that not only increase the risk of water-borne disease, but also may be the major cause of antibiotic resistance transmission in this part of Bangladesh.",Antibiotic Resistance; Coliform; Drinking Water; Fecal Coliform; Integron1,,,SAGE Publications Ltd,11786221,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85127020752

Water bodies may become contaminated by wild and domestic animal feces, agricultural runoff or sewage, and are often overlooked as a reservoir and source of human infection by pathogenic microorganisms. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the presence of the zoonotic pathogens, Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes, in various water bodies located in urban and rural areas in the north of Portugal. Water samples were collected from six sites, including natural and artificial ponds, in two different time periods. Several water quality physicochemical parameters, as well as fecal indicator bacteria, were evaluated. High levels of total coliforms (>1.78 log CFU/100 mL) were detected in all samples, and substantial numbers of Enterococcus (>2.32 log CFU/100 mL) were detected in two ponds located in a city park and in an urban garden. Escherichia coli counts ranged from undetectable to 2.76 log CFU/100 mL. Salmonella spp. was isolated from two sites, the city park and the natural pond, while L. monocytogenes was isolated from three sites: the city garden, the natural pond and the artificial pond, both in the rural area. These data show that artificial and natural ponds are a reservoir of fecal indicator bacteria and enteric and zoonotic pathogens.

This study assessed the physical, chemical and microbiological quality of drinking water in small-layer farms in Southern Mozambique and identified potential risk factors for total coliform (TC) and Escherichia coli contamination of drinking water. In 20 farms, 57 samples were collected and examined for pH, nitrate content (NC), nitrite level (NL) and total hardness contents (TH). Furthermore, TC and E. coli growth were assessed at 37 °C. One hundred per cent of the drinking water was of acceptable quality in terms of pH (6.5–8.5), NC (50 mg/L) and NL (3 mg/L). Total hardness contents exceeded the recommended standard in 37.5% of borehole water samples and 91.7% of tap water samples, respectively. Total coliform and E. coli were found in 40% and 15% of water samples. Tap water samples had the greatest contamination, with TC and E. coli levels of 41.7% and 16.7%, respectively. Although not statistically significant, sampling from the beginning of the nipple line (p = 0.101, OR = 7.357, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.678–79.886) and not cleaning the rearing equipment regularly (p = 0.098, OR = 3.966, 95% CI: 0.766–20.280) were factors affecting the TC growth. Sampling from the tank water source (p = 0.001, OR = 0.005, 95% CI: 0.000–0.121) and borehole water source (OR = 13 585) and not cleaning the equipment consistently (p = 0.073, OR = 9.682,, 95% CI: 0.810–115.68) were all factors affecting E. coli growth. It is concluded that the TH and microbiological quality of the drinking water of the study region are inadequate. Regular water quality assessments should be incorporated into Mozambican layer farm management to limit the potential for health concerns, and farmers should thoroughly clean and disinfect their rearing equipment.

As a matter of fact, the use of HACCP for development and implementation of Quality Risk Management (QRM) is not usual in pharmaceutical plants and it is applied here to improve the performance of the water purification system of a polymerization pilot plant used to manufacture pharmaceutical grade polymer microparticles. Critical Control Points (CCP) were determined with the aid of a decision tree and questions were made to characterize whether identified hazards constitute actual CCPs and should be monitored. When deviations were detected, corrective actions were performed and action plans were used for following-up and implementation of corrective actions. Finally, microbiological and physicochemical parameters were analyzed and the obtained results were regarded as appropriate.

Impact of organic and microbiological pollution on the quality of water in Boussellam Valley and its environment, Setif City, Northeast Algeria. Biodiversitas 23: 2621-2629. Water pollution is a major threat and a global challenge that endangers life on earth at risk because water plays a major role in daily life. Several sources of water pollutants, i.e., organic, industrial, domestic and microbial pollution, may trigger an outbreak of water-borne diseases. Boussellam Valley crosses the Quaternary formations, which dominate the extent of the plain surrounding the region of Sétif in the North-East of Algeria. It is one of the main water resources, mainly for drinking water supply and irrigation. The shallow water table composed of the geological formations containing this aquifer is very heterogeneous in texture and varies considerably from upstream to downstream of the sub-watershed. Thus, the North and East zones are marked by chloride-calcium facies, the central part by a Bicarbonate-calcium facies. At the same time, sulfate-magnesium facies characterize the West zone. This study aimed to evaluate the pollution by organic elements: nitrites, nitrates, and microbiological elements: total and fecal coliforms and streptococci and their impact on the water quality. Samples were collected during May and June 2021 from 5 stations along the valley, and 18 wells were spread out on the plain. The analysis of nitrites and nitrates was carried out by liquid chromatography. In addition, the colony counting of coliforms and streptococci was carried out according to the recommendations of the Algerian water company. The results show an increase in the concentration of nitrites, nitrates, total and fecal coliforms, and the streptococci, particularly in valley waters with very high levels that exceed the normal threshold of drinking water. This increase may be due to wastewater discharges and the intensive use of fertilizers, septic tanks, leaching of animal manure, runoff water, and rearing of domestic or wild animals. The increased levels of nitrites, nitrates, total and fecal coliforms, and the streptococci increase the risk of the vulnerability of the waters of the plain to pollution and degradation of surface waters and the environment in general.",Boussellam Valley; Organic And Microbiological Pollution; Sétif; Water,,,Society for Indonesian Biodiversity,1412033X; 20854722,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85130730676

Nowadays, there are several different types of drinking water, including water cooler dispensers (WCDs), which are becoming a popular device in educational institutions. Therefore, this study aims to determine the bacteriological quality of drinking water from WCDs, and inspect their hygienic conditions in students' dormitories at a university in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand. Methods: Water samples from 53 WCDs installed in 13 dormitories were collected and analyzed coliform bacteria by using the multiple-tube fermentation technique. The hygienic inspection form from the Department of Health, Ministry of Public Health, was used for inspection of the sanitary conditions. The hygienic factors of water cooler sanitation were analyzed using the generalized linear model. Results: Coliform bacteria were found in 10 out of 53 samples; moreover, Escherichia coli was recovered in three samples. Maintenance/cleaning and monitoring were the most two sanitary issues found in 100% (53/53) of the WCDs. Location and features of machine were found the correlation with the prevalence of coliform bacteria in drinking water. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest regular monitoring of water quality in educational institutions. Also, the Sanitary Standard and Operational Procedures (S.S.O.P.) should be developed to improve the hygienic conditions of the water cooler dispensers.",Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Hygiene; Water Quality; Drinking Water; Article; Bacteriology; Cleaning; Coliform Bacterium; Escherichia Coli; Fecal Coliform; Fermentation Technique; Hygiene; Nonhuman; Thailand; Water Analysis; Water Quality,drinking water; Article; bacteriology; cleaning; coliform bacterium; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; fermentation technique; hygiene; nonhuman; Thailand; water analysis; water quality,,Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications,20088213; 20087802,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85130243175

In this study, we analyzed drinking water samples from 35 tube wells, dug wells, stone spouts, and municipal tap water for bacterial and chemical contaminants, including total and fecal coliform, aluminum, arsenic, barium, beryllium, boron, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, fluoride, iron, mercury, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lead, antimony, selenium, thallium, uranium, vanadium, and zinc. We also asked a sampling of households who used these specific water sources to rate the taste of their water, list any waterborne diseases they were aware of, and share basic health information about household members. This survey provided us with information from 146 households and 603 individuals. We found widespread bacterial contamination of water sources, with 94% of sources having detectable total or fecal coliform. Nepal Drinking Water Quality Standards and World Health Organization (WHO) Drinking-Water Guidelines or health-based values were exceeded for aluminum (max = 0.53 mg/L), arsenic (max = 0.071 mg/L), iron (max = 7.22 mg/L), and manganese (max = 3.229 mg/L). The distribution of water sources with high arsenic, iron, and manganese appeared to be associated with floodplain deposits. Mixed effects logistic regression models were used to examine the interactions between social factors and water contaminants and their effects on household members' health. Consumers of water sources with both high and low concentrations of manganese were less likely to have a positive attitude towards school than those whose water sources had moderate concentrations of manganese. Social factors, especially education, played a large role in predicting individual health outcomes. Household taste ratings of drinking water were not correlated with iron or manganese concentrations, suggesting that WHO's reliance on aesthetic criteria for these contaminants instead of formal drinking-water guidelines may not be sufficient to protect public health.","Aluminum; Antimony; Arsenic; Barium; Beryllium; Boron; Cadmium; Chromium; Cobalt; Copper; Fluoride; Iron; Lead; Manganese; Mercury; Molybdenum; Nickel; Selenium; Thallium; Uranium; Vanadium; Zinc; Aluminum; Arsenic; Drinking Water; Iron; Manganese; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Aluminum; Antimony; Arsenic; Barium; Beryllium; Boron; Cadmium; Chromium; Cobalt; Copper; Drinking Water; Fluoride; Ground Water; Iron; Lead; Manganese; Mercury; Metal; Molybdenum; Nickel; Selenium; Tap Water; Thallium; Uranium; Vanadium; Well Water; Zinc; Adolescent; Adult; Article; Bacterium Contamination; Coliform Bacterium; Colony Forming Unit; Common Cold; Concentration (parameter); Consumer; Controlled Study; Education; Fecal Coliform; Female; Floodplain; Gastrointestinal Symptom; Health Status; Health Survey; Human; Hypertension; Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry; Logistic Regression Analysis; Major Clinical Study; Male; Medical Information; Nepal; Nonhuman; Post Hoc Analysis; Public Health; Social Aspect; Student Attitude; Taste Preference; Water Borne Disease; Water Contamination; Water Quality; Water Sampling; Water Supply; World Health Organization; Bacterium; Water Pollutant; Aluminum; Arsenic; Bacteria; Drinking Water; Health Status; Humans; Iron; Manganese; Public Health; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality","aluminum; antimony; arsenic; barium; beryllium; boron; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; drinking water; fluoride; ground water; iron; lead; manganese; mercury; metal; molybdenum; nickel; selenium; tap water; thallium; uranium; vanadium; well water; zinc; adolescent; adult; Article; bacterium contamination; coliform bacterium; colony forming unit; common cold; concentration (parameter); consumer; controlled study; education; fecal coliform; female; floodplain; gastrointestinal symptom; health status; health survey; human; hypertension; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; medical information; Nepal; nonhuman; post hoc analysis; public health; social aspect; student attitude; taste preference; water borne disease; water contamination; water quality; water sampling; water supply; World Health Organization; bacterium; water pollutant; Aluminum; Arsenic; Bacteria; Drinking Water; Health Status; Humans; Iron; Manganese; Public Health; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality",,Hindawi Limited,16879813; 16879805,,,35190745,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125154464

Around half of the total population in Myanmar has to consume water from unimproved sources. The prevalence of diarrhea due to contaminated drinking water is high even in urban areas. The urban community may expect the provision of municipal water supply in the near future if the current revolution against military dictatorship succeeds. However, the rural areas have less or no chance to get quality water because of a lot of other prioritized tasks. Household water treatment is encouraged to be implemented as one of the national water safety plans for rural water supply in Myanmar. This study explored the diarrhea prevention awareness of the rural community using a questionnaire survey. The microbial quality parameters of drinking water sources were also examined. Fecal coliform contamination was detected in all examined drinking water sources. A significant association was found between drinking untreated water and the occurrence of diarrhea. The percentage of people who applied the diarrhea preventive measures was low. Even if they knew how to prevent the disease, very few people applied the measures in reality. Therefore, measures to cause behavioral change should be initiated, together with awareness raising, to promote diarrhea prevention in the community.",Developing Country; Diarrhea; Drinking Water; Health Education; Hygiene; Public Health; Drinking Water; Diarrheal Disease; Hygiene; Rural Area; Sanitation; Water Quality; Water Supply; Article; Behavior Change; Diarrhea; Disease Control; Escherichia Coli; Fecal Coliform; Health Care System; Household; Human; Myanmar; Nonhuman; Prevalence; Questionnaire; Rural Population; Urban Population; Water Contamination; Water Treatment; Diarrhea; Humans; Hygiene; Prevalence; Sanitation,drinking water; diarrheal disease; hygiene; rural area; sanitation; water quality; water supply; Article; behavior change; diarrhea; disease control; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; health care system; household; human; Myanmar; nonhuman; prevalence; questionnaire; rural population; urban population; water contamination; water treatment; Diarrhea; Humans; Hygiene; Prevalence; Sanitation,,IWA Publishing,14778920; 19967829,,,35100162,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123972824

To explore the pollution status of FC in rivers of Kyrgyzstan, a mountainous country with traditional agro-pastoral economy, 184 water samples from the rivers of Kyrgyzstan in low and high river flow period were analyzed. Spatial autocorrelation and classical statistical methods were used to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution and driving factors of FC. The results showed that the surface water quality of Kyrgyz rivers was good, and the concentration range of FC was 0–23 MPN/100 mL. Temporally, the maximum FC concentration was 4 MPN/100 mL in low river flow period, while in the period of high river flow, the highest value reached to 23 MPN/100 mL. Spatially, the concentration of FC in high altitude areas was low, while that in the lowland areas was relatively high, which indicated that animal husbandry in high altitude areas contributed little to FC in rivers, and urban domestic sewage and agricultural activities in lowlands were the main pollution sources of FC in rivers. There was no correlation between FC and hardness, electrical conductivity (EC), pH and total organic carbon (TOC) in river water of Kyrgyzstan, and the distribution of FC in high river flow period was mainly driven by population and human modification of terrestrial systems.

In E. coli isolates from ECC plates without antibiotics from ten influent samples (n = 300), highest resistance was observed against ampicillin (16.6%), sulfamethoxazole (9.7%) and trimethoprim (9.0%), while in effluent samples (n = 262) it was against sulfamethoxazole (11.8%), ampicillin (11.5%) and tetracycline (8.8%). All isolates (n = 123) obtained on cefotaxime-containing plates were multidrug-resistant.

CTX-M-15 was the most prevalent (42.9%) extended-spectrum β-lactamase among cefotaxime-resistant isolates, followed by CTX-M-27 (31.4%) and CTX-M-14 (17.1%), resembling clinical prevalence in Norway. Most of the sequenced isolates carried other clinically relevant ARGs, such as dfrA17, sul1, sul2, tet(A), aph(6)-Id, aph(3’’)-Ib and aadA5. Sixteen different sequence types (STs) were identified, including ST131 (39.1%), ST38 (10.9%) and ST69 (8.7%). One E. coli isolate belonging to novel ST (ST11874) carried multiple virulence factors including genotoxin, salmochelin, aerobactin and yersiniabactin, suggesting that this isolate has potential to cause health concerns in future. Our study reveals presence of clinically relevant ARGs like bla<inf>NDM-6</inf> and tet(X4) in pathogenic strains, which have so far not been reported from the clinics in Norway. Our study may thus, provide a framework for population-based surveillance of antibiotic resistance.","Antibiotic Resistance Genes; Esbls; Escherichia Coli; Norway; Sewage-based Surveillance; Aerobactin; Ampicillin; Azithromycin; Beta Lactamase; Cefotaxime; Ceftazidime; Chloramphenicol; Ciprofloxacin; Colistin; Gentamicin; Meropenem; Nalidixic Acid; Sulfamethoxazole; Tetracycline; Tigecycline; Trimethoprim; Anti-bacterial Agents; Beta-lactamases; Sewage; Aerobactin; Ampicillin; Azithromycin; Bacterial Dna; Beta Lactamase; Beta Lactamase Ctx M; Carbapenemase; Cefotaxime; Ceftazidime; Chloramphenicol; Ciprofloxacin; Colistin; Genotoxin; Gentamicin; Meropenem; Nalidixic Acid; Salmochelin; Sulfamethoxazole; Tetracycline; Tigecycline; Trimethoprim; Unclassified Drug; Virulence Factor; Yersiniabactin; Antiinfective Agent; Antibiotic Resistance; Environmental Stress; Fecal Coliform; Microbial Activity; Microbial Community; Sewage; Aada5 Gene; Antibiotic Sensitivity; Aph Gene; Article; Bacterial Gene; Bacterial Virulence; Bacterium Isolate; Bacterium Isolation; Bla Ndm 6 Gene; Dfra17 Gene; Dna Extraction; Dna Sequencing; Escherichia Coli; Incubation Time; Minimum Inhibitory Concentration; Multidrug Resistance; Nonhuman; Norway; Prevalence; Sequence Analysis; Sul1 Gene; Sul2 Gene; Tet(a) Gene; Tet(x4) Gene; Whole Genome Sequencing; Escherichia Coli Infection; Genetics; Human; Microbial Sensitivity Test; Bergen; Hordaland; Anti-bacterial Agents; Beta-lactamases; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Escherichia Coli Infections; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Prevalence; Sewage","aerobactin; ampicillin; azithromycin; bacterial DNA; beta lactamase; beta lactamase CTX M; carbapenemase; cefotaxime; ceftazidime; chloramphenicol; ciprofloxacin; colistin; genotoxin; gentamicin; meropenem; nalidixic acid; salmochelin; sulfamethoxazole; tetracycline; tigecycline; trimethoprim; unclassified drug; virulence factor; yersiniabactin; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; environmental stress; fecal coliform; microbial activity; microbial community; sewage; aadA5 gene; antibiotic sensitivity; aph gene; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial virulence; bacterium isolate; bacterium isolation; bla ndm 6 gene; dfrA17 gene; DNA extraction; DNA sequencing; Escherichia coli; incubation time; minimum inhibitory concentration; multidrug resistance; nonhuman; Norway; prevalence; sequence analysis; sul1 gene; sul2 gene; tet(A) gene; tet(X4) gene; whole genome sequencing; Escherichia coli infection; genetics; human; microbial sensitivity test; Bergen; Hordaland; Anti-Bacterial Agents; beta-Lactamases; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Escherichia coli Infections; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Prevalence; Sewage",,Academic Press,01476513; 10902414,,EESAD,34571418,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115616326

Currently, the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in 2019. The virus can pass to the faeces of some patients, as was the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses. This suggests that apart from the airborne (droplets and aerosols) and person-to-person (including fomites) transmission, the faecal–oral route of transmission could also be possible for HCoVs. In this eventuality, natural water bodies could act as a virus reservoir of infection. Here, the temporospatial migration and attenuation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in municipal wastewater, the receiving environment, and drinking water is evaluated, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in the South African setting. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was identified in raw wastewater influent but was below the detection limit in the latter treatment stages. This suggests that the virus decays from as early as primary treatment and this could be attributed to wastewater's hydraulic retention time (2–4 h), composition, and more importantly temperature (>25 °C). Therefore, the probability of SARS-CoV-2 virus transportation in water catchments, in the eventuality that the virus remains infective in wastewater, appears to be low in the South African setting. Finally, catchment-wide monitoring offers a snapshot of the status of the catchment in relation to contagious viruses and can play a pivotal role in informing the custodians and downstream water users of potential risks embedded in water bodies.",Attenuation; Municipal Wastewater; Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rt-qpcr); Sars-cov-2; Sars-cov-2 Migration; Water Quality Monitoring; Ammonia; Chlorine; Nitrate; Phosphate; Drinking Water; Waste Water; Dr6000; Mx3005p; Nanodrop 2000; Nucleomag; Catchments; Population Statistics; Potable Water; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Viruses; Wastewater Treatment; Water Quality; Attenuation; Coronaviruses; Middle East; Mortality Rate; Municipal Wastewaters; Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cov; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-cov-2; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-cov-2 Migration; Water Quality Monitoring; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Ammonia; Chlorine; Drinking Water; Nitrate; Phosphate; Catchment; Concentration (composition); Covid-19; Disease Spread; Drinking; Mortality; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Wastewater Treatment; Water Quality; Aquatic Environment; Article; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Coliphage; Controlled Study; Cycle Threshold Value; Disease Reservoir; Electric Conductivity; Escherichia Coli; Fecal Coliform; Hydraulic Retention Time; Limit Of Detection; Microbial Attenuation; Municipal Wastewater; Nonhuman; Ph; Physical Chemistry; Real Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction; River; Rna Analysis; Rna Extraction; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Spectrophotometry; Temperature; Virus Detection; Wastewater; Water Monitoring; Epidemic; Human; South Africa; Sars Coronavirus; Disease Outbreaks; Drinking Water; Humans; Sars-cov-2; Waste Water,Catchments; Population statistics; Potable water; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Viruses; Wastewater treatment; Water quality; Attenuation; Coronaviruses; Middle East; Mortality rate; Municipal wastewaters; Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV; Severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2; Severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 migration; Water quality monitoring; Polymerase chain reaction; ammonia; chlorine; drinking water; nitrate; phosphate; catchment; concentration (composition); COVID-19; disease spread; drinking; mortality; polymerase chain reaction; wastewater treatment; water quality; aquatic environment; Article; chemical oxygen demand; coliphage; controlled study; cycle threshold value; disease reservoir; electric conductivity; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; hydraulic retention time; limit of detection; microbial attenuation; municipal wastewater; nonhuman; pH; physical chemistry; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; river; RNA analysis; RNA extraction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; spectrophotometry; temperature; virus detection; wastewater; water monitoring; epidemic; human; South Africa; SARS coronavirus; Disease Outbreaks; Drinking Water; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Waste Water,,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,34388648,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113196321

Given the limited availability of quantitative norovirus data to input to QMRA models, some studies have applied a conversion factor to estimate norovirus exposure based on measured fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations. We conducted a review of peer-reviewed publications to identify the concentrations of noroviruses and FIB in raw, secondary-treated, and disinfected wastewater. A meta-analysis was performed to determine the ratios of norovirus-FIB pairs in each wastewater matrix and the variables that significantly impact these ratios. Norovirus-to-FIB ratios were found to be significantly impacted by the norovirus genotype, month of sample collection, geographic location, and the extent of wastewater treatment. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of using a FIB-to-virus conversion factor in QMRA and found that the choice of conversion ratio has a great impact on estimated health risks. For example, the use of a conversion ratio previously used in the World Health Organization Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater predicted health risks that were significantly lower than those estimated with measured norovirus concentrations used as inputs. This work emphasizes the gold standard of using measured pathogen concentrations directly as inputs to exposure assessment in QMRA. While not encouraged, if one must use a FIB-to-virus conversion ratio to estimate norovirus dose, the ratio should be chosen carefully based on the target microorganisms (i.e., strain, genotype, or class), prevalence of disease, and extent of wastewater treatment.",Fecal Indicator Bacteria; Norovirus; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (qmra); Wastewater Treatment; Waste Water; Bioindicator; Concentration (composition); Covid-19; Host-pathogen Interaction; Meta-analysis; Pathogen; Virus; Wastewater Treatment; World Health Organization; Bacterium; Bacterium Contamination; Disease Burden; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Indicator; Fecal Coliform; Feces; Genotype; Health Hazard; Meta Analysis; Nonhuman; Norovirus; Practice Guideline; Prevalence; Quantitative Analysis; Review; Risk Assessment; Risk Factor; Sensitivity Analysis; Systematic Review; Viral Contamination; Virus Concentration; Waste Water Management; Wastewater; Water Contamination; Human; Microbiology; Bacteria; Feces; Humans; Risk Assessment; Waste Water; Water Microbiology,bioindicator; concentration (composition); COVID-19; host-pathogen interaction; meta-analysis; pathogen; virus; wastewater treatment; World Health Organization; bacterium; bacterium contamination; disease burden; environmental exposure; environmental indicator; fecal coliform; feces; genotype; health hazard; meta analysis; nonhuman; Norovirus; practice guideline; prevalence; quantitative analysis; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; viral contamination; virus concentration; waste water management; wastewater; water contamination; human; microbiology; Bacteria; Feces; Humans; Risk Assessment; Waste Water; Water Microbiology,,IWA Publishing,14778920; 19967829,,,34874900,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121904473

Drinking water samples from 60 water dispensers of different type-brands were collected and tested for physicochemical and microbiological parameters by following WHO Drinking Water Quality guidelines. Also evaluated by questionnaires were hygienic standards and maintenance of water dispensers. The physicochemical analysis of all water samples did not exceed the reference values of the drinking water standard; the hardness value in only 13.3% of samples was slightly higher than the reference limit. The microbiological results indicated that total coliform and fecal coliform bacteria were found in 16.67% and 8.33% of total samples, respectively.

This study linked environmental data to E. coli geometric means collected at 18 beaches in Toronto (2008–2019) and the Niagara Region (2011–2019) to examine the environmental predictors of E. coli. We developed region-specific models using mixed effects models to examine E. coli as a continuous variable and recommended thresholds of E. coli concentration (100 CFU/100 mL and 200 CFU/100 mL). Substantial clustering of E. coli values at the beach level was observed in Toronto, while minimal clustering was seen in Niagara, suggesting an important beach-specific effect in Toronto beaches. Air temperature and turbidity (measured directly or visually observed) were positively associated with E. coli in all models in both regions. In Toronto, waterfowl counts, rainfall, stream discharge and water temperature were positively associated with E. coli levels, while solar irradiance and water level were negatively associated. In Niagara, wave height and water level had a positive association with E. coli, while rainfall was negatively associated. The differences in regional models suggest the importance of a region-specific approach to addressing beach water quality. The results can guide beach monitoring and management practices, including predictive modelling.",Environmental Factors; Escherichia Coli; Fecal Indicator Bacteria; Recreational Water; Water Quality; Fresh Water; Rain; Beach; Environmental Factor; Fecal Coliform; Freshwater Environment; Health Impact; Health Risk; Marine Pollution; Public Health; Water Quality; Air Temperature; Article; Canada; Colony Forming Unit; Environmental Monitoring; Escherichia Coli; Nonhuman; Predictor Variable; Seashore; Stream (river); Turbidity; Water Temperature; Waterfowl; Feces; Microbiology; Swimming; Niagara; Ontario [canada]; Toronto; Anatidae; Indicator Indicator; Bathing Beaches; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Fresh Water; Water Microbiology,fresh water; rain; beach; environmental factor; fecal coliform; freshwater environment; health impact; health risk; marine pollution; public health; water quality; air temperature; Article; Canada; colony forming unit; environmental monitoring; Escherichia coli; nonhuman; predictor variable; seashore; stream (river); turbidity; water temperature; waterfowl; feces; microbiology; swimming; Niagara; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto; Anatidae; Indicator indicator; Bathing Beaches; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Fresh Water; Water Microbiology,,MDPI,16604601; 16617827,,,34886567,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120657973

During episodic rainfall events resulting in runoff, microorganisms in the waste and soil may migrate into surface runoff, contaminating surface water resources. A probabilistic human exposure (HE) model was created to determine exposure to faecal indicator bacteria (FIB): total coliforms (TC), E. coli and enterococci following application of bio-based fertiliser (dairy cattle slurry, digestate) to grassland; using a combination of experimental field results and literature-based data. This step was followed by a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) model for pathogenic E. coli based on a literature-based dose-response model. The results showed that the maximum daily HE (HE<inf>daily</inf>) is associated with E. coli for unprocessed slurry (treatment T1) on day 1, the worst-case scenario where the simulated mean HE<inf>daily</inf> was calculated as 2.84 CFU day −1. The results indicate that the overall annual probability of risk (P<inf>annual</inf>) of illness from E. coli is very low or low based on the WHO safe-limit of P<inf>annual</inf> as 10 −6. In the worst-case scenario, a moderate risk was estimated with simulated mean P<inf>annual</inf> as 1.0 × 10 −5. Unpasteurised digestate application showed low risk on day 1 and 2 (1.651 × 10 −6, 1.167 × 10 −6, respectively). Pasteurised digestate showed very low risk in all scenarios. These results support the restriction imposed on applying bio-based fertiliser if there is any rain forecast within 48 h from the application time. This study proposes a future extension of the probabilistic model to include time, intensity, discharge, and distance-dependant dilution factor. The information generated from this model can help policymakers ensure the safety of surface water sources through the quality monitoring of FIB levels in bio-based fertiliser.",Drinking Water Treatment; Fecal Indicator Bacteria; Ireland; Pathogen Load; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment; Surface Runoff; Agricultural Wastes; Escherichia Coli; Health Risks; Potable Water; Rain; Risk Assessment; Risk Perception; Runoff; Water Pollution; Water Treatment; Bio-based; Digestate; Drinking Water Treatment; E.

Indigenous Mayans who already face disproportionate health challenges rely directly on the lake water. Our objectives were to: (1) estimate prevalence of shedding of water-borne fecal parasites among children 5 years of age and younger, (2) assess household-reported incidence of gastrointestinal illness in children, and (3) characterize water sources, treatment, and sanitation conditions in households. We hypothesized that household use of untreated lake water results in increased risk of shedding of parasites and gastrointestinal symptoms. A cross-sectional fecal sampling and physical exam of 401 children were conducted along with WASH surveys in partnership with healthcare providers in seven communities. Fecal samples were screened for Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum, using a rapid ELISA, with a portion examined by microscope. The prevalence of parasite shedding was 12.2% (9.7% for Giardia; 2.5% for Cryptosporidium). Risk factors for Giardia shedding included age 3 years or older (3.4 odds ratio, z-stat D 2.781 pD0:0054), low height-for-Age z-score (2.3 odds ratio, z-stat D 2.225, pD0:0216), lack of any household water treatment (2.5 odds ratio, z-stat D 2.492, p0:0012), and open access to household latrine (2.04 odds ratio, z-stat D 1.992, pD0:0464). The majority (77.3%) of households reported water treatment, boiling and gravity fed filters as the most widespread practices. The vast majority of households (92%) reported usage of a latrine, while 40% reported open and shared access beyond their household. An overwhelming majority of households reported diarrhea and fever several times per year or greater, with approximately half reporting vomiting at that frequency. Lake water use was identified as a risk factor for households reporting frequent gastrointestinal symptoms (odds ratio of 2.5, 4.4, and 2.6; z-stat of 3.10, 3.65, and 3.0; p-values of 0.0021, 0.0003, and 0.0028, for diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, respectively) in children 5 years of age and younger. The frequency of gastrointestinal illness with a strong link to lake drinking water cannot be explained by the prevalence of protozoa, and risk from other enteropathogens must be explored. Improving access to water treatment and sanitation practices could substantially reduce the parasite burden faced by developing children in the region.",Childhood Stunting; Cryptosporidium; Diarrhea; Fecal Protozoa; Gastrointestinal Illness; Giardia; Indigenous Guatemalans; Lake Atitlán; Vomiting; Water Quality; Hypochlorite Sodium; Hypochlorite Sodium; Article; Child; Controlled Study; Cryptosporidium Parvum; Diarrhea; Entamoeba Histolytica; Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Fever; Food Allergy; Gastrointestinal Disease; Giardia Intestinalis; Health Care; Household; Human; Major Clinical Study; Male; Parasitosis; Physical Examination; Preschool Child; Questionnaire; Risk Factor; Sanitation; Vomiting; Water Quality,hypochlorite sodium; Article; child; controlled study; Cryptosporidium parvum; diarrhea; Entamoeba histolytica; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; fever; food allergy; gastrointestinal disease; Giardia intestinalis; health care; household; human; major clinical study; male; parasitosis; physical examination; preschool child; questionnaire; risk factor; sanitation; vomiting; water quality,,PeerJ Inc.,21678359,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119586036

In EWSs, OPs occur at high frequencies and concentrations, cause drinking-water-related disease outbreaks, and are a major factor threatening public health. Therefore, the prevalence of OPs in EWSs represents microbial drinking water quality. Closely or routinely monitoring the dynamics of OPs in municipal EWSs is thus critical to ensuring drinking water quality and protecting public health. Monitoring the dynamics of conventional (fecal) indicators (e.g., total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and Escherichia coli) is the customary or even exclusive means of assessing microbial drinking water quality. However, those indicators infer only fecal contamination due to treatment (e.g., disinfection within water utilities) failure and EWS infrastructure issues (e.g., water main breaks and infiltration), whereas OPs are not contaminants in drinking water. In addition, those indicators appear in EWSs at low concentrations (often absent in well-maintained EWSs) and are uncorrelated with OPs. For instance, conventional indicators decay, while OPs regrow with increasing hydraulic residence time. As a result, conventional indicators are poor indicators of OPs (the major aspect of microbial drinking water quality) in EWSs. An additional or supplementary indicator that can well infer the prevalence of OPs in EWSs is highly needed. This systematic review argues that Legionella as a dominant OP-containing genus and natural inhabitant in EWSs is a promising candidate for such a supplementary indicator. Through comprehensively comparing the behavior (i.e., occurrence, growth and regrowth, spatiotemporal variations in concentrations, resistance to disinfectant residuals, and responses to physicochemical water quality parameters) of major OPs (e.g., Legionella especially L. pneumophila, Mycobacterium, and Pseudomonas especially P. aeruginosa), this review proves that Legionella is a promising supplementary indicator for the prevalence of OPs in EWSs while other OPs lack this indication feature. Legionella as a dominant natural inhabitant in EWSs occurs frequently, has a high concentration, and correlates with more microbial and physicochemical water quality parameters than other common OPs. Legionella and OPs in EWSs share multiple key features such as high disinfectant resistance, biofilm formation, proliferation within amoebae, and significant spatiotemporal variations in concentrations. Therefore, the presence and concentration of Legionella well indicate the presence and concentrations of OPs (especially L. pneumophila) and microbial drinking water quality in EWSs. In addition, Legionella concentration indicates the efficacies of disinfectant residuals in EWSs. Furthermore, with the development of modern Legionella quantification methods (especially quantitative polymerase chain reactions), monitoring Legionella in ESWs is becoming easier, more affordable, and less labor-intensive. Those features make Legionella a proper supplementary indicator for microbial drinking water quality (especially the prevalence of OPs) in EWSs. Water authorities may use Legionella and conventional indicators in combination to more comprehensively assess microbial drinking water quality in municipal EWSs. Future work should further explore the indication role of Legionella in EWSs and propose drinking water Legionella concentration limits that indicate serious public health effects and require enhanced treatment (e.g., booster disinfection).",Drinking Water Distribution Systems; Legionella Pneumophila; Mycobacterium; Premise Plumbing; Pseudomonas; Public Health,,,Frontiers Media S.A.,2296665X,,,,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116604193

Despite the fact that the majority of the world population has met the Millennium Development Goals 7c (MDG7c) targets, more than 2.5 billion are still using unimproved sanitation facilities and affecting the safety of drinking water and public health. Because of this problem, a novel approach on ‘Non-Sewered Sanitation’ with decentralized treatment systems is being recognized as a promising alternative to accomplish the Sustainable Development Goal No. 6 (SDG6) targets on ‘Safe Water and Sanitation’ and bringing health benefits to the people. This study aimed to investigate the current status of access to improved sanitation facilities in relation to the MDG7c and SDG6 in Thailand and comparing with other countries, including the effects of unsafely managed fecal sludge (FS) on the prevalence of diarrhea and liver fluke infections. The prevailing constraints and weaknesses were identified, and effective sanitation management measures to accomplish SDG6 targets were recommended. Based on data collected from 20 cities located in the north and northeastern regions of Thailand during the period of 2015–2020, the sanitation facilities data on conventional centralized systems and FS management facilities that affect the prevalence of diarrhea and liver infections were analyzed and interpreted using statistical and response surface methodology techniques. The findings showed that most of the surveyed cities have achieved the MDG7c targets, but 70% of the FS generated from on-site sanitation systems are still unsafely managed, caused by limited expansion of sewage systems for wastewater collection and conveyance (with inadequate operation and maintenance) as well as the financial constraints, especially in areas outside of urban neighborhoods. The effective sanitation management practices to accomplish the SDG6 targets were proposed such as increasing the capacity of sanitation facilities to be 55,000 m3/day/30,000 households, designing appropriate FS collection program and treatment technology, and providing more awareness programs for safe sanitation management and health risk protection.",Effective Sanitation Measures; Fecal Pathogen Infections; Fecal Sludge Management; Improved Sanitation Facilities; Millennium Development Goals; Sustainable Development Goals; Health Risks; Information Management; Potable Water; Public Health; Sanitation; Sewage; Sustainable Development; Urban Growth; Effective Sanitation Measure; Faecal Sludge; Fecal Pathogen Infection; Fecal Sludge Management; Improved Sanitation Facility; Millennium Development Goals; Pathogen Infection; Sanitation Measures; Sludge Management; Sustainable Development Goal; Planning; Decadal Variation; Fecal Coliform; Millenium Development Goal; Sanitation; Sludge; Sustainable Development Goal; Wastewater Treatment; Thailand; Fasciola Hepatica,Health risks; Information management; Potable water; Public health; Sanitation; Sewage; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Effective sanitation measure; Faecal sludge; Fecal pathogen infection; Fecal sludge management; Improved sanitation facility; Millennium development goals; Pathogen infection; Sanitation measures; Sludge management; Sustainable development goal; Planning; decadal variation; fecal coliform; Millenium Development Goal; sanitation; sludge; Sustainable Development Goal; wastewater treatment; Thailand; Fasciola hepatica,,IWA Publishing,20439083; 24089362,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119994587

Physicochemical parameters for general water quality, detection of coliform bacteria and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing were performed on all samples. Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) testing indicated a wide distribution of coliform bacteria in all sampled freshwater sites with evidence of fecal coliform in most locations. Importantly, evidence of coliform bacteria was found in most seawater samples inside and along the reef, apart from those samples taken ~20 km offshore. Illumina 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region confirmed the presence of various types of harmful bacterial species, namely from the Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcae, Streptococcaceae, and Vibrionacea families. By combining the sensitivity of FIB testing and next-generation sequencing, we were able to show the extent of potential contaminations in fresh and seawater samples and simultaneously identify the potential pathogenic bacterial genera present.

Additionally, increasing the number of animals in a holding pen at fairs, increasing the stocking density of animals in transport trailers to fairs, and having access to water in transport trailers significantly increased the odds of detecting pathogens in livestock faeces of any animal species. Observing solid material in water, stale feed and soiled bedding was associated with detecting higher E. coli concentrations. These findings provide evidence of faecal pathogens present at county fairs and suggest that site observations can aid in assessing levels of faecal exposure. The findings also indicate that the use of biosecurity measures such as (a) routine changing of livestock drinking water, feed and bedding, (b) not overstocking animals in holding pens and trailers and (c) keeping species in separate holding areas may reduce the risk of humans and livestock being exposed to faecal pathogens.",Biosecurity; Faecal Pathogen; Fairs; Drinking Water; Article; California; Campylobacter; Concentration (parameter); Controlled Study; Cryptosporidium; Escherichia Coli; Feces; Giardia; Indicator Organism; Juvenile; Livestock; Microorganism Detection; Nonhuman; Salmonella; Stocking Density; United States; Adolescent; Animal; Bovine; Cattle Disease; Cryptosporidiosis; Goat Disease; Human; Pig; Sheep; Sheep Disease; Swine Disease; Adolescent; Animals; Biosecurity; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Cryptosporidiosis; Feces; Goat Diseases; Humans; Sheep; Sheep Diseases; Swine; Swine Diseases,drinking water; Article; California; Campylobacter; concentration (parameter); controlled study; Cryptosporidium; Escherichia coli; feces; Giardia; indicator organism; juvenile; livestock; microorganism detection; nonhuman; Salmonella; stocking density; United States; adolescent; animal; bovine; cattle disease; cryptosporidiosis; goat disease; human; pig; sheep; sheep disease; swine disease; Adolescent; Animals; Biosecurity; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Cryptosporidiosis; Feces; Goat Diseases; Humans; Sheep; Sheep Diseases; Swine; Swine Diseases,,John Wiley and Sons Inc,18632378; 18631959,,,33780154,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103166314

Thus, the water quality in this river concerns the health of local inhabitants. The present study reveals seasonal variations of various physicochemical and heavy metals parameters and microbial load of water at 15 sites from Qena to Sohag cities, Egypt. The water is fresh with TDS ≤ 270 and 410 mg L−1 in summer and winter, respectively. Fe, Mn, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn concentrations were within drinking water specification in both seasons except Cr and Cd in summer. Viable numbers of total coliform, fecal coliform, and fecal streptococci were recorded in both seasons with fecal streptococci's disappearing in winter. The concentrations of salts and ions in winter were higher than summer due to decreased water quantity and flow rate in this season. On the other hand, heavy metals and bacteria were higher in summer owing to the rain and weathering of upstream rocks and increasing of human activities during the summer. The calculated water quality index (WQI) depicted that the chemical quality of water was poor for drinking and treatment, especially biological treatment, which is required before the water is supplied for drinking. Human health risk assessment factors such as probable daily intake, hazard quotient, and carcinogenic risk indicated high risks of Cr, Cd, and Ni for adults and children in both seasons. The non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks are mainly posed by Cr. The WQI values for the other water uses indicated the marginal quality for aquatic life, fair for irrigation, and fair in summer to good in winter for livestock consumption. The irrigation water quality parameters indicated that the water could be used to irrigate all soils and crops except the hazard of biological contamination. The water–rock interaction controls water chemistry besides the contribution of human activities. The agricultural, industrial, and municipal wastewaters were the main contributors to water pollution and should be treated before discharge into the Nile River. Source and drinking water should be monitored continuously to prevent related human waterborne diseases.","Health Risk Assessment; The Nile River; Water Chemistry; Water Pollution; Water Quality Index; Metals, Heavy; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Bacterium; Health Risk; Heavy Metal; Monitoring; Physicochemical Property; Risk Assessment; Seasonal Variation; Water Chemistry; Water Pollution; Water Quality; Egypt; Nile River; Qena; Sohag; Bacteria (microorganisms); Adult; Analysis; Child; Environmental Monitoring; Human; River; Toxicity; Water Pollutant; Adult; Bacteria; Child; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Risk Assessment; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality","bacterium; health risk; heavy metal; monitoring; physicochemical property; risk assessment; seasonal variation; water chemistry; water pollution; water quality; Egypt; Nile River; Qena; Sohag; Bacteria (microorganisms); adult; analysis; child; environmental monitoring; human; river; toxicity; water pollutant; Adult; Bacteria; Child; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Risk Assessment; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality",,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,15732983; 02694042,,,33772385,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103349432

The conditions present at small WWTPs relative to larger WWTPs influence the ability to follow the pandemic. Small WWTPs (<24,000 inhabitants) had lower median loads of SARS-CoV-2 despite similar incidence of infection within the municipalities served by the different WWTP (but not lower loads of HAdV and JCPyV).

It is known that these indicators are associated with disease causing organisms which are of great concern to public health. This study assessed the relationship between coliform bacteria and water geochemistry in surface and ground water systems in the Tarkwa mining area using logistic regression models. In surface water sources, higher values of chloride (OR = 0.891, p<005), phosphates (OR = 0.452, p<0.05), pH (OR = 0.174, p<0.05) and zinc (OR = 0.001, p<0.05) were associated with lower odds of faecal coliform contamination. In groundwater sources, higher values of phosphates (OR = 0.043, p<0.001), total dissolved solids (OR = 0.858, p<0.05), turbidity (OR = 0.996, p<0.05) and nickel (OR = 6.09E-07, p<0.05) implied noncontamination by faecal coliform. However, higher values of electrical conductivity (OR = 1.097, p<0.05), nitrates (OR = 1.191, p<0.05) and total suspended solids (OR = 1.023, p<0.05) were associated with higher odds of faecal coliform contamination of groundwater sources. Nitrates and total suspended solids, in this case, were completely mediated by the heavy metals. For total coliform in surface water systems, higher values of magnesium (OR = 1.070, p<0.05) was associated with higher odds of total coliform contamination while higher values of phosphates (OR = 0.968, p<0.05) was associated with lower odds of total coliform contamination although the presence of heavy metals completely mediated these relationships. For ground water systems, higher values of pH (OR = 0.083, p<0.05), phosphates (OR = 0.092, p<0.05), turbidity (OR = 0.950, p<0.05) and chloride (OR = 0.860, p<0.05) were associated with lower odds of total coliform contamination. However, higher values of total suspended solids (OR = 1.054, p<0.05) and nitrates (OR = 1.069, p<0.05) implied contamination of total coliform in ground water sources. The relationship between nitrates and total coliform were mediated by the heavy metals. This study establishes the need to monitor, manage and remediate surface and ground water sources for potential disease causing microbes in ways that takes into consideration the factors that create different conditions in the two water systems. This study validates the usefulness of statistical models as tools for preventing surface and ground water contamination.","Chloride; Magnesium; Nickel; Nitrate; Phosphate; Water; Drinking Water; Metals, Heavy; Soil; Chloride; Ground Water; Magnesium; Nickel; Nitrate; Phosphate; Surface Water; Water; Drinking Water; Heavy Metal; Article; Bacterium Contamination; Bacterium Examination; Coliform Bacterium; Comparative Study; Concentration (parameter); Electric Conductivity; Escherichia Coli; Fecal Coliform; Geochemistry; Mining; Nonhuman; Ph; Prediction; Suspended Particulate Matter; Turbidity; Water Analysis; Water Pollution Indicator; Water Quality; Chemistry; Enterobacteriaceae; Ghana; Microbiology; Soil; Water Supply; Drinking Water; Groundwater; Metals, Heavy; Soil; Water Microbiology; Water Quality; Water Supply","chloride; ground water; magnesium; nickel; nitrate; phosphate; surface water; water; drinking water; heavy metal; Article; bacterium contamination; bacterium examination; coliform bacterium; comparative study; concentration (parameter); electric conductivity; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; geochemistry; mining; nonhuman; pH; prediction; suspended particulate matter; turbidity; water analysis; water pollution indicator; water quality; chemistry; Enterobacteriaceae; Ghana; microbiology; soil; water supply; Drinking Water; Groundwater; Metals, Heavy; Soil; Water Microbiology; Water Quality; Water Supply",,Public Library of Science,19326203,,POLNC,34547049,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115436441

From this point of view, wastewater-based epidemiology represents a modern diagnostic tool for describing the health status of a certain part of the population in a specific region. Hospital wastewater is a complex mixture of pharmaceuticals, illegal drugs, and their metabolites as well as different susceptible and antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, including viruses. Many studies pointed out that wastewater from healthcare facilities (including hospital wastewater), significantly contributes to higher loads of micropollutants, including bacteria and viruses, in municipal wastew-ater. In addition, such a mixture can increase the selective pressure on bacteria, thus contributing to the development and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. Because many pharmaceuticals, drugs, and microorganisms can pass through wastewater treatment plants without any significant change in their structure and toxicity and enter surface waters, treatment technologies need to be improved. This short review summarizes the recent knowledge from studies on micropollutants, pathogens, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and viruses (including SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater from healthcare facilities. It also proposes several possibilities for improving the wastewater treatment process in terms of efficiency as well as economy.",Antibiotic-resistant Microorganisms; Antimicrobial Resistance Genes; Hospital Wastewater Treatment; Pharmaceuticals; Sars-cov-2; Ammonia; Amoxicillin; Atenolol; Benzodiazepine; Beta Lactamase; Caffeine; Carbamazepine; Cefotiam; Cephalosporin; Chloride; Citalopram; Cotinine; Diclofenac; Fluvoxamine; Hydroxyl Radical; Hypochlorite Sodium; Methamphetamine; Midazolam; Nitrate; Nitrite; Nitrogen; Oxazepam; Oxygen; Ozone; Piperacillin; Quetiapine; Sulpiride; Tramadol; Valsartan; Vancomycin; Venlafaxine; Ammonia; Amoxicillin; Analgesic Agent; Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2; Antibiotic Agent; Anticonvulsive Agent; Antidepressant Agent; Atenolol; Benzodiazepine; Beta Adrenergic Receptor Blocking Agent; Beta Lactamase; Caffeine; Carbamazepine; Cefotiam; Cephalosporin; Chloride; Citalopram; Cotinine; Cytostatic Agent; Diclofenac; Fluvoxamine; Hydroxyl Radical; Hypochlorite Sodium; Illicit Drug; Methamphetamine; Midazolam; Nanoparticle; Narcotic Analgesic Agent; Nitrate; Nitrite; Nitrogen; Oxazepam; Oxygen; Ozone; Piperacillin; Quetiapine; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitor; Sorbent; Sulpiride; Tramadol; Valsartan; Vancomycin; Venlafaxine; Adenoviridae; Antibiotic Resistance; Astroviridae; Bacterium; Chlorination; Conductance; Depression; Disinfection; Drug Industry; Drug Use; Escherichia Coli; Fecal Coliform; Fenton Reaction; Gastroenteritis; Health Care Facility; Health Status; Hepatitis; Hepatitis A Virus; Klebsiella Pneumoniae; Meningitis; Metabolite; Microbiome; Microorganism; Nitrification; Nonhuman; Norovirus; Oxidation Reduction Potential; Ozonation; Pandemic; Phenotype; Photocatalysis; Physical Chemistry; Pollutant; Pollution; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Review; Rotavirus; Schizophrenia; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Sewage Treatment Plant; Supercritical Water Oxidation; Systematic Review; Toxicity; Ultrafiltration; Ultrasound; Ultraviolet Radiation; Viral Clearance; Virus; Waste Water Management; Wastewater; Wastewater-based Epidemiology,ammonia; amoxicillin; analgesic agent; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antibiotic agent; anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; atenolol; benzodiazepine; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; beta lactamase; caffeine; carbamazepine; cefotiam; cephalosporin; chloride; citalopram; cotinine; cytostatic agent; diclofenac; fluvoxamine; hydroxyl radical; hypochlorite sodium; illicit drug; methamphetamine; midazolam; nanoparticle; narcotic analgesic agent; nitrate; nitrite; nitrogen; oxazepam; oxygen; ozone; piperacillin; quetiapine; reactive oxygen metabolite; serotonin uptake inhibitor; sorbent; sulpiride; tramadol; valsartan; vancomycin; venlafaxine; Adenoviridae; antibiotic resistance; Astroviridae; bacterium; chlorination; conductance; depression; disinfection; drug industry; drug use; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; Fenton reaction; gastroenteritis; health care facility; health status; hepatitis; Hepatitis A virus; Klebsiella pneumoniae; meningitis; metabolite; microbiome; microorganism; nitrification; nonhuman; Norovirus; oxidation reduction potential; ozonation; pandemic; phenotype; photocatalysis; physical chemistry; pollutant; pollution; real time polymerase chain reaction; Review; Rotavirus; schizophrenia; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sewage treatment plant; supercritical water oxidation; systematic review; toxicity; ultrafiltration; ultrasound; ultraviolet radiation; viral clearance; virus; waste water management; wastewater; wastewater-based epidemiology,,MDPI,20796382,,,,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114828443

Contamination levels have been monitored in past studies, yet the sources, routes, and extents of contamination are not always clear. We evaluated pollution from municipal wastewater (MWW) discharge and investigated fecal contamination by Escherichia coli (E. coli) in three agricultural fields on the outskirts of Hue City, Vietnam. After E. coli concentration was determined in irrigation water (IRW), MWW, soil, vegetables (VEG), and manure, its dispersion from MWW was tracked using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and phylogenetic analyses during the wet and dry seasons. IRW was severely contaminated; 94% of the samples were positive with E. coli exceeding the stipulated standards, while VEG contamination was very low in both seasons. The confirmed total number of isolates was comparable between the seasons; however, results from MLST and phylogenetic clustering revealed more links between the sites and samples to MWW during the wet season. The wet season had four mixed clusters of E. coli isolates from multiple locations and samples linked to MWW, while only one mixed cluster also linking MWW to IRW was observed during the dry season. The most prevalent sequence type (ST) complex 10 and two others (40 and 155) have been associated with disease outbreaks, while other STs have links to major pathotypes. Irrigation canals are significant routes for E. coli dispersion through direct links to the urban drainage-infested river. This study clarified the genotype of E. coli in Hue city, and the numerous links between the samples and sites revealed MWW discharge as the source of E. coli contamination that was enhanced by flooding.",Agricultural Farms; E.

Both analytes require regular monitoring according to the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) of Pakistan. Groundwater samples (n = 100) were collected from 25 villages across four zones. Samples were analysed for physicochemical parameters including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), Escherichia coli (E. coli) contamination, nitrite, and nitrate (NO2- and NO3-). Whilst the average concentrations of NO3- in the water samples were within the permissible limits of 50 mg L−1 set by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and NEQS two villages exceeded the safety limits. Non-carcinogenic health risks of NO3- were estimated in terms of average daily dose (ADD) and hazard quotient (HQ). The HQ values for NO3- were > 1 for children signifying potential health risks; however, the adult population had HQ < 1 which indicates no risk. Groundwater samples tested positive for E. coli contamination in 13 villages, suggesting that residents may be living at risk of various microbial diseases due to drinking of contaminated water. The findings of this study provide valuable baseline data for groundwater researchers, policymakers, and the local public health department.","E.

The lockdown has decreased microbial populations and heavy metals. Fe, Cu, Cd, Ni, Pb and Cr exceeded the drinking water limits, respectively, in 77%, 45%, 27%, 18%, 9% and 91% of the pre-lockdown samples.

During a sixmonth trial, the plant achieved an average removal efficiency of 98.2% (1.74 log removal) for fecal coliforms (FC) and 96.0% (1.40 log removal) for Enterococci (EN), as well as 95.6% for BOD<inf>5</inf>, 91.0% for COD,00 and 95.4% for suspended solids (SS). The contribution of the UASB reactor to this overall performance was very significant as, alone, it achieved a yield of 62.7% for FC and 60% for EN, in addition to 65.2% for BOD<inf>5</inf> and 65.0% for SS. EN was chosen, in addition to FC, because of its higher specificity and strong environmental persistence, leading to an increased risk to human health. In fact, the experimental results confirmed its lower removal efficiency compared to FC. The mechanical and biological mechanisms that led to such a removal efficiency of the two fecal indicators (FIs) are outlined in the article. The same mechanisms led to a good level of equivalence between the removal efficiency of the two FIs with the removal efficiency of SS and BOD<inf>5</inf>, for both the whole plant and the UASB reactor alone. The research demonstrated the close correlation between the concentrations of EN and FC for the plant effluent. This correlation can be explained by the following mathematical expression of the regression line Log EN = 0.2571 Log FC + 3.5301, with a coefficient of determination R2 = 0.912. This implies that the concentration of the more specific indicator EN could be calculated, with acceptable approximation, from the simple analysis of FC and vice versa. The experimental plant brought important health benefits to the local population. In particular, there were no significant odor emissions; moreover, the risk of fecal pathogenic diseases was drastically reduced; finally, there was no proliferation of insects and other disease vectors, due to the absence of stagnant or semi-stagnant water exposed to the atmosphere.",Constructed Wetland; Enterococci; Fecal Coliforms; Fecal Indicators; Phytodepuration; Sewage Treatment; Uasb; Bioindicator; Constructed Wetland; Experimental Study; Fecal Coliform; Pollutant Removal; Survival; Brazil; Hexapoda; Indicator Indicator,bioindicator; constructed wetland; experimental study; fecal coliform; pollutant removal; survival; Brazil; Hexapoda; Indicator indicator,,MDPI,20711050,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113403653

Consequently, intestinal parasites may be present in this body of water, posing risks to water safety and human health. This study was able to detect the protozoan parasite, Giardia duodenalis, in three Laguna Lake stations and seven tributary rivers in a 13-month monitoring period by PCR amplification of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene of Giardia cysts concentrated from water samples. The pathogen was present in 37.7% of tributary samples (n = 69) and 16.7% of lake samples (n = 36). Notable frequencies of detection were observed in four tributary rivers —Bagumbayan, Taguig (66.7%); Santa Rosa, Laguna (55.6%); San Cristobal, Cabuyao, Laguna (44.4%); and Biñan, Laguna (42.9%). All test SSU rRNA gene sequences were identified as human-infective genotypes of G. duodenalis predominated by Assemblage A (94.1%). Furthermore, analysis of the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) gene revealed the possible presence of mixed genotypes in at least two samples. These results support the pressing need to include protozoan pathogen monitoring in Laguna Lake and its tributaries to prevent Giardia infection in humans and animals. This study also recommends microbial source tracking to identify fecal pollution sources and aid in regulation of waste discharges into the lake and its tributaries.",Fecal Pollution; Genotyping; Giardia Duodenalis; Laguna Lake; Philippines; Genes; Health Risks; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Protozoa; River Pollution; Rivers; Rna; Giardia Duodenalis; Glutamate Dehydrogenase; Intestinal Parasites; Microbial Source Tracking; Monitoring Periods; Pathogen Monitoring; Pcr Amplification; Protozoan Parasites; Lakes; Biomonitoring; Fecal Coliform; Genotype; Health Risk; Lake Water; Parasite; Pathogen; Pathogenicity; Pollution Incidence; Risk Assessment; River Water; Species Occurrence; Tributary; Water Quality; Article; Cyst (resting Stage); Dna Sequencing; Giardia Intestinalis; Glutamate Dehydrogenase Gene; Marker Gene; Nonhuman; Philippines; Phylogenetic Tree; River; Rna Gene; Semi-nested Polymerase Chain Reaction; Small Subunit Ribosomal Rna Gene; Animal; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Genetics; Giardiasis; Human; Lake; Calabarzon; Laguna De Bay; Laguna [calabarzon]; Luzon; National Capital Region; Taguig; Giardia; Laguna; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Genotype; Giardia Lamblia; Giardiasis; Humans,Genes; Health risks; Polymerase chain reaction; Protozoa; River pollution; Rivers; RNA; Giardia duodenalis; Glutamate dehydrogenase; Intestinal parasites; Microbial source tracking; Monitoring periods; Pathogen monitoring; PCR amplification; Protozoan parasites; Lakes; biomonitoring; fecal coliform; genotype; health risk; lake water; parasite; pathogen; pathogenicity; pollution incidence; risk assessment; river water; species occurrence; tributary; water quality; Article; cyst (resting stage); DNA sequencing; Giardia intestinalis; glutamate dehydrogenase gene; marker gene; nonhuman; Philippines; phylogenetic tree; river; RNA gene; semi-nested polymerase chain reaction; small subunit ribosomal RNA gene; animal; environmental monitoring; feces; genetics; giardiasis; human; lake; CALABARZON; Laguna de Bay; Laguna [Calabarzon]; Luzon; National Capital Region; Taguig; Giardia; Laguna; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Genotype; Giardia lamblia; Giardiasis; Humans,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,15732959; 01676369,,EMASD,34224003,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109164784

Travellers to South Asia from Western Europe have high rates of acquisition of faecal CTX-M-producing E. coli (CTX-M-EC). Aims: To determine the conjugative ability of CTX-M-EC acquired by healthy volunteers after travel to South Asia, the proportion of travel-acquired CTX-M-EC where bla<inf>CTX-M</inf> is encoded on a plasmid vs on the bacterial chromosome, and the relatedness of travel-acquired CTX-M-EC plasmids to previously sequenced plasmids. Methods: Faecal samples were collected pre- and post-travel from 23 volunteers who visited South Asia, and CTX-M-EC were cultured. After short- and long-read sequencing, 10 plasmid sequences were identified and compared with previously sequenced plasmids in GenBank. Conjugation to E. coli K-12 was undertaken using filter mating. Findings: Thirty-five percent of CTX-M-EC isolates tested transferred the bla<inf>CTX-M</inf> plasmid by conjugation. Travel-acquired CTX-M-EC carried bla<inf>CTX-M</inf> on a plasmid in 62% of isolates, whereas 38% of isolates had bla<inf>CTX-M</inf> on the chromosome. CTX-M-EC plasmids acquired after travel to South Asia had close homology to previously described epidemic plasmids which are widely disseminated in humans, animals and the natural environment. Conclusion: Globally successful epidemic plasmids are involved in the spread of CTX-M-EC. Targeted strategies may be used to displace such plasmids from the host strain as part of efforts in infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Bacteria with bla<inf>CTX-M</inf> plasmids were readily acquired by healthy volunteers, and were carried on return to the UK, providing opportunities for onward dissemination.",Blactx-m; Conjugation; E.

Currently, the whole world is fighting against this pandemic that is transmitted either through exposure to virus laden respiratory or water droplets or by touching the virus contaminated surfaces. The viral load in feces of an infected patient varies according to the severity of the disease. Subsequent detection of viral genome (SARS-CoV-2) in human feces and sewage systems is an emerging concern for public health. This also dictates to reinforce the existing sewage/wastewater treatment facilities. Rapid monitoring is the key to prevent and control the current mass transmission. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a potential epidemiology tool that can act as a complementary approach for current infectious disease surveillance systems and an early warning system for disease outbreaks. In a developing country like India, inadequate wastewater treatment systems, low-operational facility and relaxed surface water quality criteria even in terms of fecal coliform bacteria are the major challenges for WBE. Herein, we review the occurrence, transmission, and survival of SARS-CoV-2, and disinfection and potential of sewage surveillance as an early warning system for COVID-19 spread. We also discuss the challenges of open-defecation practices affecting sewage-surveillance in real-time in densely populated developing countries like India.","Open Defecation; Sars-cov-2; Sewage Surveillance; Wastewater-based Epidemiology; Water; Sewage; Waste Water; Water; Coliform Bacteria; Developing Countries; Monitoring; Sewage; Surface Waters; Transmissions; Viruses; Wastewater Treatment; Water Pollution; Water Quality; Contaminated Surfaces; Disease Outbreaks; Early Warning System; Fecal Coliform Bacteria; Infected Patients; Infectious Disease; Wastewater Treatment System; Water Environments; Diseases; Surface Water; Water; Covid-19; Developing World; Environmental Fate; Epidemiology; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Sewage Treatment; Water Pollution; Article; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Defecation; Epidemic; Fecal Coliform; Human; India; Nonhuman; Prevalence; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Virus Load; Virus Survival; Virus Transmission; Waste Water Management; Wastewater-based Epidemiology; Water Disinfection; Water Quality; Water Supply; Sewage; Wastewater; Coronavirus; Sars Coronavirus; Humans; Sars-cov-2; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water","Coliform bacteria; Developing countries; Monitoring; Sewage; Surface waters; Transmissions; Viruses; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Water quality; Contaminated surfaces; Disease outbreaks; Early Warning System; Fecal coliform bacteria; Infected patients; Infectious disease; Wastewater treatment system; Water environments; Diseases; surface water; water; COVID-19; developing world; environmental fate; epidemiology; severe acute respiratory syndrome; sewage treatment; water pollution; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; defecation; epidemic; fecal coliform; human; India; nonhuman; prevalence; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus load; virus survival; virus transmission; waste water management; wastewater-based epidemiology; water disinfection; water quality; water supply; sewage; wastewater; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water",,IWA Publishing,02731223; 19969732,9781843395843; 0080336590; 0080310362; 9781843395959; 9781843396000; 9780080336695; 0080290930; 9781843391883; 0080304362; 9781843391487,WSTED,34280151,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110988258

The aim of this study was to assess a possible association between basic sanitation indices and COVID-19 rates in all the 5570 municipalities of Brazil and its spatial distribution. Methods: Data of COVID-19 cases registered in Brazil from 28 February until 31 May 2020 and independent variables associated with basic sanitation were included. Results: High incidence rates were significantly associated with precarious water service index (0-25% coverage) and offstandard faecal coliforms index for tap water (5-50% and 75-100% of samples tested). A significant association between high mortality rates and sewage collection (0-25% coverage)/treatment (25-50% coverage) indices was also verified. In addition, clusters with significant spatial autocorrelation were identified mainly in the North and Northeast regions for mortality and incidence rates (high-high risk areas) and for offstandard faecal coliforms index. Those regions are considered the poorest in Brazil, presenting with low incomes, human agglomerations, as well as a poor basic sanitation system, which also hinder the implementation of COVID-19-preventative measures.

This study aimed to compare two common approaches for quantifying Escherichia coli (E. coli) density in natural water versus the ColiPlate™ kit approach. For comparing methods, 41 field samples from natural water sources in Kentucky (USA) were collected. E. coli densities were then determined by (1) membrane filtration in conjunction with modified membrane‐thermotolerant E. coli (mTEC) agar, (2) Idexx Quanti‐Tray® 2000 with the Colilert® substrate, and (3) the Bluewater Biosciences ColiPlate kit. Significant correlations were observed between E. coli density data for all three methods (p < 0.001). Paired t‐test results showed no difference in E. coli densities determined by all the methods (p > 0.05). Upon assigning modified mTEC as the reference method for determining the World Health Organization‐assigned “very high‐risk” levels of fecal contamination (> 100 E. coli CFU/100 mL), both ColiPlate and Colilert exhibited excellent discrimination for screening very high‐risk levels according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (~89%).

We conducted an environmental assessment nested within the WASH Benefits Bangladesh randomized controlled trial (NCT01590095). We quantified E. coli and fecal coliforms in samples of stored drinking water, child hands, mother hands, soil, and food among a random sample of households from the sanitation and control arms of the trial. Samples were collected during eight quarterly visits approximately 1-3.5 years after intervention initiation. Overall, there were no substantial differences in environmental fecal contamination between households enrolled in the sanitation and control arms. Statistically significant reductions were found in stored water and child hands after pooling across sampling rounds, but the effects were small and not consistent across rounds. In addition, we assessed potential effect modification of intervention effects by follow-up time, season, wealth, community-level latrine density and coverage, population density, and domestic animal ownership. While the intervention had statistically significant effects within some subgroups, there were no consistent patterns of effect modification.

The fecal-oral transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 and the role of the wastewater as a potential source of infection, more than ever highlights the importance of proper wastewater management during the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review represents a picture of the current state of hospital wastewater (HWW) management in Iran; an upper-middle income country with a paucity of proper data concerning HWW management and further provides suggestions for hospital wastewater management during COVID-19 pandemic in the country. We reviewed 31 papers that published from 2005-2020 evaluated 163 hospitals from 82 cities and 17 provinces. HWW generation in Iran varies from 354 to 1892 liter per bed per day (839±363 L/bed/d). BOD, COD and TSS in the raw HWW were in the range of 119-1270, 205-1611 and 58-464 mg/L, respectively. Total coliforms and/or total fecal coliforms were in the range of 105-108 (MPN/100 mL). 44.2 % of hospitals had an active WWTP at the time of the study from which, only 15.3 % complied with discharge standards.

Street water is packaged, distributed, and sold not paying attention to good hygienic practices, and its consumption is often associated with the occurrence of diarrheal diseases. Coincidentally, the increase of diarrheal diseases promotes the inappropriate use of antibiotics that might cause the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. In this context, the present study aimed to assess the microbiological quality of water sold on the streets of Maputo, as well as the antibiotic resistance profile of selected Enterobacteriaceae isolates. The 118 water samples analyzed were from street home-bottled water (n = 81), municipal water distribution systems (tap water) (n = 25), and selected supply wells in several neighborhoods (n = 12). The samples were analyzed for total mesophilic microorganisms, fecal enterococci, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio spp. The results showed a high level of fecal contamination in all types of water samples. In home-bottled water, fecal coliforms were found in 88% of the samples, and E. coli in 66% of the samples. In tap water, fecal coliforms were found in 64%, and E. coli in 28% of the samples. In water from supply wells, fecal coliforms and E. coli were found in 83% of the samples. From 33 presumptive Vibrio spp. colonies, only three were identified as V. fluvialis. The remaining isolates belonged to Aeromonas spp. (n = 14) and Klebsiella spp. (n = 16). Of 44 selected Enterobacteriaceae isolates from water samples (28 isolates of E. coli and 16 isolates of Klebsiella spp.), 45.5% were not susceptible to the beta-lactams ampicillin and imipenem, 43.2% to amoxicillin, and 31.8% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Regarding non-beta-lactam antibiotics, there was a high percentage of isolates with tolerance to tetracycline (52.3%) and azithromycin (31.8%). In conclusion, water in Maputo represents a risk for human health due to its high fecal contamination. This situation is made more serious by the fact that a relatively high percentage of isolates with multidrug resistance (40%) were found among Enterobacteriaceae. The dissemination of these results can raise awareness of the urgent need to reduce water contamination in Maputo and other cities in Mozambique.",Antibiotic Resistance; Beta-lactams; Enterobacteriaceae; Maputo-mozambique; Street Water; Water Quality,,,MDPI AG,20797737,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85108946988

In this study, the inactivation efficacy of P22 virus and Escherichia coli bacteria was tested using ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs), which provided effective disinfection of both waterborne microorganisms. Using a peak wavelength emission of 255, 265, or 285 nm, the batch-Test, UV LED collimated beam system demonstrated high inactivation potential for both microorganisms at all wavelengths, suggesting that it could be an effective alternative to typical, low-pressure (LP) or medium-pressure (MP), mercury-based UV systems. Increased inactivation kinetics for both microorganisms was observed with decreasing wavelength (255 > 265 > 285 nm). However, the trend reversed when accounting for energy efficiency of the systems (255 < 265 < 285 nm) due to the currently lower wall plug efficiency for lower UV LED wavelength emissions.

Strategic assessment and monitoring of water quality are essential pathways to reduce contaminant level of microbes responsible for waterborne diseases. As in Karachi's case study, two wastewater discharge drains were identified at Sea View, which is famous for recreational activities. These two primary discharge drains contained contaminants, including various pathogens that pollute the marine environment and disturb the ecosystem. The current study aims to assess the water quality along the beach through an in-depth monitoring program lasting from May till September 2020. The assessment focused on total coliform (TC) and faecal coliform (FC) counts; biochemical oxygen demand (BOD<inf>5</inf>) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Analysis of the results conclude that both discharge drains contained high levels of TC (1600 MPN or CFU per 100 mL of the sample) and FC (203 MPN per 100 mL). Moreover, COD and BOD levels were found to be high (COD 945 mg/L and BOD 410 mg/L).

Therefore, this study aimed at assessing prevalence of TTV in DWNWWS. The study systematically identified and meta-analyzed published studies on TTV prevalence in DWNWWS hosted in Dimensions, Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases using a random-effects model and mixed-effects meta-regression model for sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, the meta-analysis was stratified to estimate water type-specific TTV prevalence. The study found a total of 58 articles, of which 13 articles subdivided into 31 studies with 374 TTV positive cases and 862 total sample sizes were systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed. The pooled prevalence of TTV in DWNWWS was 37.18% (95%CI: 23.76–55.55%). Prevalence of TTV was significantly different across water types and it was 56.67% (95%CI: 36.94–75.46%) in wastewater, 26.72% (95%CI: 6.87–52.56%) in river water, and 17.17% (95%CI: 0.54–45.39%) in drinking water. TTV incidence in seawater and groundwater was 0% and 25.0% respectively. Funnel plots constructed and associated statistics of rank correlation test and Egger's regression test in this study, show lack of publication bias in the pooled prevalence of TTV in DWNWWS. Although, sample type (QM(df = 1) = 6.9656, p = 0.0083) and concentration methods (QM(df = 1) = 3.8055, p = 0.0511) significantly moderated and accounted for 15.39% and 6.00% of heterogeneity in the prevalence of TTV in DWNWWS respectively. In conclusion, research focus/monitoring activities on TTV is generally inadequate and potential risk of TTV in DWNWWS is underappreciated in most nations; the analyzed studies were from 7 countries (USA, Japan, Italy, Iran, Germany, Egypt, and Brazil). Finally, inefficient concentration method severely influences the prevalence of TTV in DWNWWS and could give rise to underestimation of TTV and mar TTV-based source-tracking of anthropogenic pollutions.",Anthropocentric Pollution; Gastroenteritis; Meta-analysis; Source-tracking; Torque Teno Virus; Wastewater; Water; Waterborne Disease; Drinking Water; Waste Water; Computer Viruses; Groundwater; Random Processes; Regression Analysis; River Pollution; Sensitivity Analysis; Viruses; Anthropogenic Pollution; Concentration Method; Random Effects Model; Rank Correlation; Regression Model; Regression Tests; Systematic Review; Wastewater Network; Potable Water; Drinking Water; Fresh Water; Ground Water; River Water; Sea Water; Concentration (composition); Fecal Coliform; Meta-analysis; Numerical Model; Pollutant Removal; Regression Analysis; Removal Experiment; Wastewater Treatment; Article; Brazil; Effluent; Egypt; Germany; Iran; Italy; Japan; Nonhuman; Pollution Monitoring; Prevalence; Sludge; Systematic Review; Torque Teno Virus 1; United States; Viral Contamination; Wastewater; Water Contamination; Water Supply; Meta Analysis; Scopus; Torque Teno Virus; Drinking Water; Prevalence; Waste Water,Computer viruses; Groundwater; Random processes; Regression analysis; River pollution; Sensitivity analysis; Viruses; Anthropogenic pollution; Concentration method; Random effects model; Rank correlation; Regression model; Regression tests; Systematic Review; Wastewater network; Potable water; drinking water; fresh water; ground water; river water; sea water; concentration (composition); fecal coliform; meta-analysis; numerical model; pollutant removal; regression analysis; removal experiment; wastewater treatment; Article; Brazil; effluent; Egypt; Germany; Iran; Italy; Japan; nonhuman; pollution monitoring; prevalence; sludge; systematic review; Torque teno virus 1; United States; viral contamination; wastewater; water contamination; water supply; meta analysis; Scopus; Torque teno virus; Drinking Water; Prevalence; Waste Water,,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,33736166,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100428962

The current work aimed at evaluating groundwater quality for drinking and associated health risks in an area of the Nile Delta (30° 14″ 47″ to 30° 17′ 51″ N and 31° 17′ 38″ to 31° 20′12″ E) in response to irrigation water quality. Thirty groundwater samples were collected from three irrigated sites (ten samples from each site); the Nile freshwater (NFW), the agricultural drainage water (ADW), and mixed wastewater (MWW) irrigated sites. Overall, ranges of pH, Ca2＋, Mg2+, F−, NO<inf>3</inf>−, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn were within the permissible levels according to Egypt and WHO drinking water standards, while the count of total and fecal coliform bacteria exceeded safety limits. The water quality index indicated that samples from the NFW-, ADW- and MWW-irrigated sites had moderate to good, low, and low to moderate qualities, respectively. On average, the hazard index (HI) indicated no potential non-cancer risk for adults (HI < 1.0) in the three sampling sites, while children in the MWW-irrigated sites would suffer adverse health risks (HI > 1.0). The mean total cancer risk (TCR) was in the acceptable range (1.0 × 10−6 to 1.0 × 10−4) for adults in two sites (the NFW- and ADW-irrigated sites), while adults in the MWW-irrigated sites and children in all sampling sites would suffer cancer risks over the lifetime (TCR > 1.0 × 10−4). The potential cancer risk would be mainly due to Ni exposure via the oral route, and thus further management studies should be considered to mitigate the adverse effects.

Current tendencies, such as the growing concentration of populations in large urban conurbations, climate change, aging of existing infrastructures, and emerging pathogens, indicate that the management of water resources will become increasingly challenging in the near fu-ture. In this context, there is an urgent need to control the fate of fecal microorganisms in wastewater to avoid the negative health consequences of releasing treated effluents into surface waters (rivers, lakes, etc.) or marine coastal water. On the other hand, the measurement of bacterial indicators yields insufficient information to gauge the human health risk associated with viral infections. It would therefore seem advisable to include a viral indicator—for example, somatic coliphages—to monitor the functioning of wastewater treatments. As indicated in the studies reviewed herein, the concentrations of somatic coliphages in raw sewage remain consistently high throughout the year worldwide, as occurs with bacterial indicators. The removal process for bacterial indicators and coliphages in traditional sewage treatments is similar, the concentrations in secondary effluents remaining sufficiently high for enumeration, without the need for cumbersome and costly concentration procedures. Additionally, according to the available data on indicator behavior, which is still limited for sewers but abundant for surface waters, coliphages persist longer than bacterial indicators once outside the gut. Based on these data, coliphages can be recommended as indicators to assess the efficiency of wastewater management procedures with the aim of minimizing the health impact of urban wastewater release in surface waters.",Fecal Indicator; Marine Coastal Water; Sewage Treatment; Somatic Coliphages; Surface Water; Water Safety; Bacteria; Climate Change; Effluents; Health; Health Risks; Risk Assessment; Sanitation; Sewage; Sewage Treatment; Surface Waters; Water Management; Bacterial Indicators; Complementary Tools; Health Consequences; Human Health Risks; Marine Coastal Water; Somatic Coliphages; Wastewater Management; Waterborne Infectious Disease; Wastewater Treatment; Effluent; Fecal Coliform; Health Risk; Infectious Disease; Pathogen; Surface Water; Urban Area; Wastewater Treatment; Bacteria (microorganisms); Indicator Indicator; Varanidae,Bacteria; Climate change; Effluents; Health; Health risks; Risk assessment; Sanitation; Sewage; Sewage treatment; Surface waters; Water management; Bacterial indicators; Complementary tools; Health consequences; Human health risks; Marine coastal water; Somatic coliphages; Wastewater management; Waterborne infectious disease; Wastewater treatment; effluent; fecal coliform; health risk; infectious disease; pathogen; surface water; urban area; wastewater treatment; Bacteria (microorganisms); Indicator indicator; Varanidae,,MDPI AG,20734441,,,,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105085630

Water samples from the selected borehole and well were collected over a period of 12 weeks (n = 48). The concentrations of Escherichia coli, faecal coliforms, Salmonella, Shigella, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium and Campylobacterwere determined using standard microbiological methods, which involve the use of a membrane filter technique. The water samples were filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane filter using vacuum pump pressure and plated on selective agar for the bacteria under test. The number of colonies of the bacterial growth observed after the incubation period was counted and recorded. The physicochemical properties of the water were determined using standard methods. The risk of Salmonella, Shigella, Clostridium and Campylobacter infections resulting from the ingestion of water from the borehole and well was estimated. The results showed that the levels of enteric bacteria in the borehole were higher than those in the well. The mean levels of E. coli in water from the borehole and well were 3.3 and 1.7 log<inf>10</inf> cfu/100 ml, respectively, and exhibited a negative relationship with salinity (r= -0.53). The estimated risks of infection associated with the pathogens in water from the borehole and well were greater than the acceptable risk limit of 10-4 and followed this order Clostridium < Salmonella < Campylobacter< Shigella. The findings of this study suggest recent and continuous faecal contamination of the two groundwater sources, thus exposing the residents relying on the water for drinking to potential risks of gastrointestinal infections.",Dose-response; Faecal Indicator Bacteria; Human Health; Infection; Microbial Risk Assessment; Dissolved Oxygen; Drinking Water; Ground Water; Well Water; Agar; Borehole; Coliform Bacterium; Detection Method; Heathland; Incubation; Ingestion Rate; Membrane; Microbial Activity; Salinity; Water Resource; Article; Bacterial Count; Bacterial Growth; Bacterium Colony; Bacterium Contamination; Bacterium Detection; Bifidobacterium; Campylobacter; Campylobacteriosis; Clostridium; Clostridium Infection; Colony Forming Unit; Electric Conductivity; Enterobacteriaceae; Escherichia Coli; Fecal Coliform; Fluid Intake; Health Hazard; Incubation Time; Infection Risk; Nigeria; Nonhuman; Ph; Risk Assessment; Salmonella; Salmonellosis; Shigella; Shigellosis; Turbidity; Water Contamination; Water Filtration; Water Quality; Water Sampling; Water Supply; Water Temperature; Intestine Flora; Microbiology; Bacteria (microorganisms); Indicator Indicator; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Groundwater; Water Microbiology,dissolved oxygen; drinking water; ground water; well water; agar; borehole; coliform bacterium; detection method; heathland; incubation; ingestion rate; membrane; microbial activity; salinity; water resource; Article; bacterial count; bacterial growth; bacterium colony; bacterium contamination; bacterium detection; Bifidobacterium; Campylobacter; campylobacteriosis; Clostridium; Clostridium infection; colony forming unit; electric conductivity; Enterobacteriaceae; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; fluid intake; health hazard; incubation time; infection risk; Nigeria; nonhuman; pH; risk assessment; Salmonella; salmonellosis; Shigella; shigellosis; turbidity; water contamination; water filtration; water quality; water sampling; water supply; water temperature; intestine flora; microbiology; Bacteria (microorganisms); Indicator indicator; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Groundwater; Water Microbiology,,IWA Publishing,14778920; 19967829,,,33901027,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105109723

Over more than 1.25 million people in the Swat district rely on surface and groundwater sources for drinking, agricultural purposes. Hence, the need to ascertain the drinking water quality and associated human health risks were considered highly significant. In this study, eighty water samples (40 for chemical parameters and 40 for biological parameters) were randomly collected from schools and colleges at Mingora city, district Swat. The mean values of physico-chemical water quality parameters such as pH (6.3), TDS (410.7 mg/l), EC (709.7), temperature (25.83 °C), turbidity (0.47 NTU), alkalinity (104.8 mg/l), salinity (910.0 mg/l), total hardness (348.15 mg/l), dissolved oxygen (DO) (2.35 ppm), chlorine (5.4 mg/l), fluoride (1.12 mg/l), nitrate (NO<inf>3</inf>) (44.52 mg/l) and nitrite (NO<inf>2</inf>) (4.05 mg/l) were measured using standard methods recommended by World Health Organization and the American Public Health Association. Besides, the mean value of total coliform bacteria, including fecal coliform, was found; (0.32) with standard deviation; (0.572) whereas, the mean value of Escherichia coli was found (0.3) with a standard deviation of (0.564). This study also finds the drinking water sources highly contaminated by fecal coliform bacteria, including Escherichia coli, which is the main reason for many waterborne diseases such as gastroenteritis, dysentery, and diarrhea. Additionally, residents of the area also reported some instances of viral hepatitis. Moreover, the significant variations among various water quality parameters were attributed to growing urbanization trends, nearby agricultural runoffs, lack of proper sewerage/solid waste disposal systems, and direct discharge of waste effluents containing human and animal fecal material. Hence, the need for adequate education on health hygiene and water treatment practices was highly recommended. Similarly, the execution of routine drinking water quality monitoring by relevant organizations was considered indispensable.",Biological Parameters; Drinking Water Quality; Escherichia Coli; Fecal Coliform; Health Risk; Physico-chemical Parameters; Waterborne Diseases; Agricultural Robots; Agriculture; Alkalinity; Biochemical Oxygen Demand; Dissolved Oxygen; Effluents; Escherichia Coli; Fluorine Compounds; Groundwater; Health; Health Risks; Potable Water; Statistics; Waste Disposal; Water Distribution Systems; Water Hardness; Water Treatment; Drinking Water Sources; Educational Institutions; Fecal Coliform Bacteria; Physico-chemical Water Qualities; Total Coliform Bacteria; Waste Disposal Systems; Water Quality Parameters; World Health Organization; Water Pollution; Assessment Method; Drinking Water; Education; Fecal Coliform; Health Risk; Organization; Parameter Estimation; Physicochemical Property; Public Health; Waste Disposal; Water Quality; Khyber-pakhtunkhwa; Pakistan; Swat,Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Alkalinity; Biochemical oxygen demand; Dissolved oxygen; Effluents; Escherichia coli; Fluorine compounds; Groundwater; Health; Health risks; Potable water; Statistics; Waste disposal; Water distribution systems; Water hardness; Water treatment; Drinking water sources; Educational institutions; Fecal coliform bacteria; Physico-chemical water qualities; Total coliform bacteria; Waste disposal systems; Water quality parameters; World Health Organization; Water pollution; assessment method; drinking water; education; fecal coliform; health risk; organization; parameter estimation; physicochemical property; public health; waste disposal; water quality; Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa; Pakistan; Swat,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18666299; 18666280,9.78354E+12,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104238031

The study was carried out over a three-year period (2013–2015) in the San Roque Dam, Córdoba, Argentina. The overall frequency detection was 62.9% for PBV, 64.2% for HAdV and 70.4% for iEV. No significant differences were observed in the rates of detection for any of these viruses through the years studied, and a seasonal pattern was not present. Whenever there was RVA detection in the samples analyzed, there was also detection of iEV and/or HAdV and/or PBV. At least one of the viral groups analyzed was demonstrated in the 100% of the samples with faecal coliforms values within the guideline limits. In this setting, especially in those samples which reveal faecal indicator bacteria within the guideline limit, we propose to carry out a pathway, involving PBV, HAdV and iEV detection in order to enhance the evaluation of microbiological quality in freshwater in Argentina. The proposed methodological strategy could report faecal contamination in water, mainly of human origin, and the condition of the matrix to maintain viral viability.

Worldwide, countries im-posed stringent mass quarantine and lockdowns to curb the transmission of the pathogen. While the efficacy of such lockdown is debatable, several reports suggest that the reduced human activities provided an inadvertent benefit by briefly improving air and water quality. India observed a 68-days long, nation-wide, stringent lockdown between 24 March and 31 May 2020. Here, we delineate the impact of the lockdown on groundwater and river sourced drinking water sustainability in the arsenic polluted Ganges river basin of India, which is regarded as one of the largest and most polluted river basins in the world. Using groundwater arsenic measurements from drinking water wells and water quality data from river monitoring stations, we have studied ~700 km stretches of the middle and lower reaches of the As (arsenic)-polluted parts of the river for pre-lockdown (Jan-uary-March 2020), syn-lockdown (April-May), and post-lockdown periods (June-July). We provide the extent of As pollution-free groundwater vis-à-vis river water and examine alleviation from lock-down as an opportunity for sustainable drinking water sources. The overall decrease of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations and increase of pH suggests a general improvement in Ganges water quality during the lockdown in contrast to pre-and-post lockdown periods, potentially caused by reduced effluent. We also demonstrate that land use (agricultural/industrial) and land cover (urban-periurban/rural) in the vicinity of the river reaches seems to have a strong influence on river pollutants. The observations provide a cautious optimistic scenario for potentially developing sustainable drinking water sources in the arsenic-affected Ganges river basin in the future by using these observations as the basis of proper scientif-ically prudent, spatially adaptive strategies, and technological interventions.","Bod; Cod; Covid-19; Fecal Coliform; Ganges River; Lockdown; Water Quality; Arsenic; Arsenic; Drinking Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Arsenic; Drinking Water; Ground Water; Rain; Adaptive Management; Biochemical Oxygen Demand; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Covid-19; Disease Control; Disease Incidence; Fecal Coliform; River Basin; River Pollution; Water Availability; Water Management; Water Quality; Water Resource; Article; Concentration (parameter); Conceptual Framework; Controlled Study; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Disease Association; Environmental Factor; Environmental Impact; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Sustainability; Geographic Distribution; Human; India; Land Use; Lockdown; Machine Learning; Nonhuman; Ph; Water Contamination; Water Pollution; Communicable Disease Control; Pandemic; River; Water Pollutant; Ganges Basin; Arsenic; Communicable Disease Control; Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Rivers; Sars-cov-2; Water Pollutants, Chemical","arsenic; drinking water; ground water; rain; adaptive management; biochemical oxygen demand; chemical oxygen demand; COVID-19; disease control; disease incidence; fecal coliform; river basin; river pollution; water availability; water management; water quality; water resource; Article; concentration (parameter); conceptual framework; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; environmental sustainability; geographic distribution; human; India; land use; lockdown; machine learning; nonhuman; pH; water contamination; water pollution; communicable disease control; pandemic; river; water pollutant; Ganges Basin; Arsenic; Communicable Disease Control; Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Rivers; SARS-CoV-2; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,MDPI AG,16604601; 16617827,,,33802172,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102606947

Millennium Development Goal 7c (MDG 7c) targets improved access to water and sanitation because 85% of the world’s total FS is often discharged on public areas. Like other countries, Thailand faces fecal slugde management (FSM) problems leading to significant fecal pathogen infections, especially in the north and northeastern regions. This study assessed the effects of unsafely-managed FS on human health risks in two cities, Natan City and Tham Lod City in Thailand, that have relatively high liver fluke and diarrhea infections, and identified the factors relating to FSM practices that affect the prevalence of liver fluke and diarrhea infections due to FS. Specific measures were proposed in delivering integrated FSM solutions and health risk protection toward the Sustainable Development Goal No. 6 (SDG6) targets of safely managed sanitation and hygiene services. Based on data collected from these cities from February to May 2019, factors relating to FSM practices that affect the prevalence of liver fluke and diarrhea infections were identified and analysed using multiple regression analysis. Based on the findings, specific measures in delivering integrated FSM solutions and health risk protection toward the Sustainable Development Goals 6 (SDG 6) are proposed. Because no FS treatment facilities operate in Natan City and Tham Lod City, almost 100% of FS is discharged directly into open drains, resulting in diarrhea and liver fluke infections among local people. The findings identified the factors relating to FSM practices that affect the prevalence of liver fluke and diarrhea infections and proposed specific measures in delivering integrated FSM solutions and health risk protection, such as promoting education programmes, avoiding direct FS discharges into open drains and nearby streams, and providing innovative FSM technologies to eradicate fecal pathogen infections.",Diarrhea Infections /fecal Sludge Management /liver Fluke Infections /pathogen Infections / Parasitic Infections; Diarrheal Disease; Disease Prevalence; Fecal Coliform; Health Risk; Pathogen; Risk Factor; Sludge; Sustainable Development Goal; Waste Management; Thailand; Fasciola Hepatica,diarrheal disease; disease prevalence; fecal coliform; health risk; pathogen; risk factor; sludge; Sustainable Development Goal; waste management; Thailand; Fasciola hepatica,,"Faculty of Environment and Resource Studies,Mahidol University",24082384; 16865456,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105015707

Cats may be at risk of water contamination from feces due to poor sanitation and hygiene. The objectives of the present study were to (1) evaluate the prevalence of coliform bacteria in cat drinking water and (2) identify possible risk factors leading to contamination. Materials and Methods: Fifty-five drinking water samples were collected from water containers used by cats (median age [range]: 5 years [8 months-15 years]) at their home. Using a sterile syringe, 50 mL water was collected directly from water containers. The water samples were stored in coliform enhancement media for 24 h and then submitted for bacterial culture. Results: The prevalence of fecal coliform contamination of cat drinking water was 67.27% (37/55; 95% confidence interval: 53.29-79.32%). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of coliform bacterial contamination of drinking water by age or gender of the cat or by water container type. However, bacterial contamination differed significantly between shorthaired cats and longhaired cats when comparing Escherichia coli (9/44 [20.45%] vs. 8/11 [72.72%], p<0.001) and Enterobacter spp. (16/44 [36.36%] vs. 9/11 [81.82%], p=0.007). For water that had been in a container longer than 12 h, there were significantly more contaminated tap water samples (16/19 [84.21%]) than contaminated processed water samples (9/17 [52.94%], p=0.047). Conclusion: Coliform contamination in cat drinking water is common and occurs more often in households with longhaired cats. Drinking water for cats should be changed every 12 h, especially for households using tap water.",Animals; Cats; Coliform; Contamination; Escherichia Coli; Hygiene; Prevalence; Water; Drinking Water; Tap Water; Abdominal Cramp; Animal Experiment; Anorexia; Article; Bacterium Contamination; Bacterium Culture; Cat; Cat Breed; Citrobacter; Coliform Bacterium; Cross-sectional Study; Depression; Enterobacter; Escherichia Coli; Female; Fever; Follow Up; Hygiene; Klebsiella; Male; Nonhuman; Prevalence; Risk Factor; Thailand; Vomiting; Water Contamination,drinking water; tap water; abdominal cramp; animal experiment; anorexia; Article; bacterium contamination; bacterium culture; cat; cat breed; Citrobacter; coliform bacterium; cross-sectional study; depression; Enterobacter; Escherichia coli; female; fever; follow up; hygiene; Klebsiella; male; nonhuman; prevalence; risk factor; Thailand; vomiting; water contamination,,Veterinary World,22310916; 09728988,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104617633

We conducted a systematic literature review on the use of MF-based FIB data in LMICs and summarized statistical methods from 172 articles. We then applied the commonly used statistical methods from the review on publicly available datasets to illustrate how data analysis methods affect FIB results and interpretation. Our findings indicate that standard methods for processing samples are not widely reported, the selection of statistical tests is rarely justified, and, depending on the application, statistical methods can change risk perception and present misleading results. These results raise concerns about the validity of FIB data collection, analysis, and presentation in LMICs.

Vultures are one group of birds with particularly high exposure to food-borne pathogens due to frequent consumption of infected livestock carcasses. The potential origin and spatial-temporal shedding patterns of livestock-adapted Salmonella serotypes of zoonotic importance were evaluated in adult and nestling Griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus). We specifically assessed the exposure source and subsequent elimination of Salmonella-infected carcasses (ecosystem services) or transmission back to livestock (ecosystem disservices) by vultures, thus contributing respectively to disease mitigation or amplification in natural and farmed environments. The results show a seasonal high occurrence and turnover of a high variety of serotypes, especially swine-adapted ones isolated at high frequency. This suggests that vultures can be reservoirs and long-distance carriers of faecal Salmonella shed in supplementary feeding stations and breeding colonies. Contrary to their conservation purposes, feeding stations can act as Salmonella hotspots and reservoirs. However, a role for vultures in the transmission back to food-producing animals seems impossible because they do not come into contact at indoor farms, while transmission to free-ranging ruminants was not supported by the presence of ruminant-adapted serotypes in the vultures. Therefore, vultures do not promote disservices associated with the re-infection of livestock with Salmonella, but can provide quantitatively important ecosystem services by removing carrion contaminated with these and other zoonotic pathogens potentially affecting their health. Sanitary vigilance of the farms authorised to provide food for avian scavengers should avoid the disposal of swine and poultry carcasses with Salmonella and the antibiotics used to treat it. Extensive free-ranging livestock and their carcasses exploited in the countryside should be a priority for the conservation of vultures and their ecological function as cleaners and disease mitigators.",Avian Scavengers; Pathogen Pollution; Pig Carcasses; Salmonella Serotypes; Supplementary Feeding Stations; Agriculture; Ecosystems; Food Microbiology; Mammals; Pollution; Transmissions; Ecological Functions; Ecosystem Services; Food-borne Pathogens; Food-producing Animals; High Frequency Hf; Livestock Production; Long-distance Carriers; Spatial Temporals; Salmonella; Antibiotic Agent; Agricultural Land; Bacterium; Bird; Breeding Population; Ecosystem Service; Feeding Behavior; Livestock Farming; Pathogen; Species Conservation; Adult; Animal Reservoir; Article; Bacterial Shedding; Bacterium Culture; Carcass; Disease Transmission; Environmental Exposure; Female; Male; Nonhuman; Priority Journal; Salmonella Enterica Serovar Anatum; Salmonella Enterica Serovar Choleraesuis; Salmonella Enterica Serovar Derby; Salmonella Enterica Serovar Enteritidis; Salmonella Enterica Serovar Typhimurium; Salmonellosis; Scavenger (organism); Seasonal Variation; Vulture (bird); Zoonotic Transmission; Animal; Ecosystem; Falconiformes; Pig; Season; Serotype; Gyps Fulvus; Lethrinidae; Ruminantia; Animals; Birds; Ecosystem; Farms; Seasons; Serogroup; Swine,Agriculture; Ecosystems; Food microbiology; Mammals; Pollution; Transmissions; Ecological functions; Ecosystem services; Food-borne pathogens; Food-producing animals; High frequency HF; Livestock production; Long-distance carriers; Spatial temporals; Salmonella; antibiotic agent; agricultural land; bacterium; bird; breeding population; ecosystem service; feeding behavior; livestock farming; pathogen; species conservation; adult; animal reservoir; Article; bacterial shedding; bacterium culture; carcass; disease transmission; environmental exposure; female; male; nonhuman; priority journal; Salmonella enterica serovar Anatum; Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis; Salmonella enterica serovar Derby; Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; salmonellosis; scavenger (organism); seasonal variation; vulture (bird); zoonotic transmission; animal; ecosystem; Falconiformes; pig; season; serotype; Gyps fulvus; Lethrinidae; Ruminantia; Animals; Birds; Ecosystem; Farms; Seasons; Serogroup; Swine,,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,33250252,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096871725

Oysters as bivalves, bio accumulate pathogens from the water through filter feeding and are suspected to play a role as disease transmission vector. In Malaysia, the data on oyster’s microbiological quality are limited. Hence, it was vital to conduct oyster related studies in Malaysia. The main objectives of this study include the enumeration of most probable number (MPN) of fecal coliforms and E. coli and isolation of E. coli from oyster (Crassostrea iredalei) and water sample for the detection of 16S rRNA and HlyA (Hemolysin A) genes of E. coli O157:H7. Methodology and results: A total of 120 oysters and water samples (n=6) were collected from a fisherman village located in southern Malaysia. Total fecal coliforms and E. coli were determined using the MPN procedure. Colonies of E. coli were identified based on Gram staining, biochemical test, and PCR detection for the presence of 16S rRNA and HlyA gene of E. coli O157:H7. The enumeration results showed that the MPN of the fecal coliforms and E. coli found in the collected oyster samples do not meet the standard to be directed for human consumption (0.72 ± 0.19 × 104 MPN/100 g and 0.13 ± 0.03 × 104 MPN/100 g, respectively). The PCR assays showed that 16 out of the 104 (15.38%) of E. coli isolated from water and oysters showed the presence of HlyA gene. The phylogenetic tree analysis showed there were genetic relationships between the HlyA gene of the E. coli isolated in this study with the ones isolated from calf and human faeces. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: The detection of Shiga toxin producing E. coli O157:H7 (HlyA gene) in cage cultured oysters (C. iredalei) and water from southern Malaysia was first time reported here. In the future, more study can be conducted to study the expression of the HlyA gene and confirm of its identity as E. coli O157:H7 using different target genes such as eaeA (encodes a 94 kD outer membrane protein called intimin) and Stx1 (Shiga toxin, Shigella dysenteriae type 1).",Crassostrea Iredalei; Escherichia Coli O157: H7; Fecal Coliforms; Hlya Gene; Malaysia,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia,22317538; 18238262,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129937300

Total and fecal coliforms were counted from the water samples using membrane filtration while selected physicochemical parameters were determined using standard methods. The mean counts of total and fecal coliforms ranged from 3.9 to 22.9 and 1 to 13.6 CFU/100 mL, respectively. Hence, all water samples did not satisfy the WHO guidelines and national standards. There were statistically significant differences in the coliform counts between the different sampling sites, and the counts were significantly higher in the taps and households’ containers compared to the counts in the source and reservoir ( p < 0.05). All physicochemical parameters, except for temperature, were within the recommended acceptable limits.

High rates of campylobacteriosis were observed during the study period (≥115 cases/100 K). Infections occurred throughout the year, with peaks in late summer and early autumn. Most infections occurred in people living in Lethbridge. Campylobacter jejuni was not isolated from municipal drinking water. In contrast, the bacterium was isolated from untreated and treated wastewater and river water (all sites). There were no correlations between C. jejuni recovery/detection from water and river flow rates, water turbidity, or fecal coliforms. Campylobacter jejuni recovery from water did not correspond to the peak periods of campylobacteriosis. The bacterium was most commonly isolated downstream of wastewater outfalls; waterfowl congregated at these sites, particularly during the winter months. A comparison of C. jejuni isolates from people and water revealed that most subtypes in water did not correspond to subtypes recovered from diarrheic people and were linked to waterfowl and other non-human animal sources.

Hepatitis E virus infection is an emerging disease with varied courses in pregnancy. There is a dearth of statistics among pregnant women. Aim. To evaluate the prevalence, associated factors, and pregnancy outcome in women that tested positive for hepatitis E virus (HEV) antibodies in pregnancy. Research Methods. This was a cross-sectional study conducted among pregnant women at a teaching hospital in Nigeria. Relevant information was collected using a structured questionnaire. Blood was collected from each of the participants, and the serum was used to determine the presence of hepatitis E immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG). The data were analysed using SPSS version 23. Associations between variables were determined at a p value of <0.05. Results. A total of 200 pregnant women participated in this study. The prevalence of HEV infection among pregnant women was 28.00% (56/200). The mean age was 30.11 ± 5.88. Hepatitis E infection was significantly associated with age (p value = 0.028), method of faecal disposal (p value = 0.043), and source of drinking water (p value = 0.039). A total of 9/200 (4.50%) stillbirths were recorded with 3/9 (33.33%) in women that tested positive for HEV antibodies. About 4/200(2.00%) miscarriages were recorded, and 2/4 (50.00%) were in women that tested positive for HEV antibodies. Hepatitis E infection was not significantly associated with perinatal outcome (p value = 0.45). Only 1/56 (0.50%) maternal death was recorded among women that tested positive to hepatitis E, and none was recorded among those that tested negative to hepatitis E antibodies. Conclusion. There was a significant statistical association between HEV infection and age, method of faecal disposal, and source of drinking water. This underscores the importance of the provision of clean water and safe faecal disposal. Hepatitis E virus infection did not significantly affect the foetal and maternal outcomes.",Drinking Water; Hepatitis E Antibody; Immunoglobulin G Antibody; Immunoglobulin M Antibody; Adult; Article; Blood Transfusion; Controlled Study; Cross-sectional Study; Defecation; Diarrhea; Disease Association; Educational Status; Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Fever; Gestational Age; Hand Washing; Hepatitis E; Human; Human Tissue; Jaundice; Major Clinical Study; Maternal Death; Maternal Mortality; Nigeria; Obstetric Delivery; Parity; Pregnancy Outcome; Pregnant Woman; Prevalence; Secondary Education; Seroprevalence; Spontaneous Abortion; Stillbirth; Structured Questionnaire; Teaching Hospital; Vaginal Delivery; Water Supply; Young Adult,drinking water; hepatitis E antibody; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; adult; Article; blood transfusion; controlled study; cross-sectional study; defecation; diarrhea; disease association; educational status; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; fever; gestational age; hand washing; hepatitis E; human; human tissue; jaundice; major clinical study; maternal death; maternal mortality; Nigeria; obstetric delivery; parity; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; prevalence; secondary education; seroprevalence; spontaneous abortion; stillbirth; structured questionnaire; teaching hospital; vaginal delivery; water supply; young adult,,Hindawi Limited,16879597; 16879589,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118540223

Results: A total of 889 cases were identified, with 51% female, 280 hospitalizations (31%), and two deaths. The median age was 27 years (range 6 months to 90 years). Cases started on July 9, a week after heavy rains. District authorities started chlorination of water sources on July 13 and cases declined soon after. Two of nine stool samples tested positive for Vibrio cholera O1 serogroup. Of the 18 water samples collected, 16 (88%) samples from multiple sources, including wells, hand pumps, and taps, were positive for fecal coliforms. Of 1,885 households in the village, 450 (24%) households had no toilets and open defecation was commonly observed in the nearby river bed. Conclusions: This ADD outbreak was likely associated with drinking contaminated groundwater, which probably occurred after heavy rainfall in an area of open defecation. We recommended providing chlorinated drinking water, promoting safe sanitation practices, including building more public and private toilets, and enhancing diagnostic laboratory capacity.",Defecation; Diarrhea; Drinking Water; Vibrio Cholerae O1; Water Wells; Cholera; Diarrhea; Epidemic; Female; Human; India; Infant; Male; Vibrio Cholerae; Cholera; Diarrhea; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Infant; Male,cholera; diarrhea; epidemic; female; human; India; infant; male; Vibrio cholerae; Cholera; Diarrhea; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Infant; Male,,NLM (Medline),22297693; 0019557X,,,33753586,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103433284

Clinical information in Wegeda town showed that the prevalence of waterborne diseases was 58%. This study aimed to evaluate bacteriological and physicochemical drinking water quality in Wegeda town. This study will add valuable scientific data for future intervention. Water samples from protected and unprotected springs, hand-dug well, taps, and households' containers were collected from November 2018 to June 2019 for bacteriological and physicochemical analyses. Besides, information about the potential risk factors was collected using a structured questionnaire. A total of 120 water samples were collected and analyzed for total and fecal coliform counts using the multiple tube fermentation method (MPN). The presence of Escherichia coli was also checked from fecal coliform positive samples collected from households' containers. Selected physicochemical parameters were also determined using the standard methods. In all cases, the median values of total and fecal coliform counts ranged from 5 to 27 and 2 to 13 MPN/100 ml, respectively. Accordingly, all of the drinking water samples did not comply with the standards. Coliforms were significantly higher in the households' containers than in the sources (p<0.05) and also significantly varied by water sources. The highest and lowest coliform counts were recorded in unprotected spring and taps, respectively. Besides, 18.33% of water samples collected from households' containers were tested positive for E. coli. Regarding physicochemical parameters, most values were within the acceptable limit values recommended by the WHO. However, water samples from unprotected spring and hand-dug well did not satisfy the turbidity limit value set by the WHO. Drinking water systems in Wegeda town were likely contaminated with pathogenic bacteria likely due to poor protection and sanitation practices. Providing the community with potable water, toilets, domestic and animal waste disposal systems, and intensive health education and sanitation practices for the community are highly recommended.",Drinking Water; Drinking Water; Adult; Article; Bacterial Count; Bacteriology; Coliform Bacterium; Escherichia Coli; Ethiopia; Fecal Coliform; Fermentation; Health Education; Household; Human; Physical Chemistry; Risk Factor; Sanitation; Structured Questionnaire; Turbidity; Waste Disposal; Water Quality; Water Sampling; Water Supply; Chemistry; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Drinking Water; Humans; Water Microbiology; Water Quality,drinking water; adult; Article; bacterial count; bacteriology; coliform bacterium; Escherichia coli; Ethiopia; fecal coliform; fermentation; health education; household; human; physical chemistry; risk factor; sanitation; structured questionnaire; turbidity; waste disposal; water quality; water sampling; water supply; chemistry; isolation and purification; microbiology; Drinking Water; Humans; Water Microbiology; Water Quality,,Hindawi Limited,16879813; 16879805,,,33628281,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101577362

Thus, the water samples from these swimming pools have undergone physicochemical and biological treatments using conventional techniques. Three groups of microorganisms (Bacteria, Protozoa, and Helminths) were identified and quantified in these swimming pools with weakly acidic waters (6.79 ± 0.35) with an average temperature of 26.63 ± 0.53 °C and suspended matter ranging from 2 to 150 mg.l−1. The total bacterial load varies between 8 × 103 and 6000 × 103 CFU/100 ml. It consists of mesophilic aerobic heterotrophic bacteria, fecal coliforms, total coliforms, fecal streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Protozoan cysts and oocysts range from 122 to 505 per liter of water. These values are slightly lower for helminth eggs and larvae (0 to 108 eggs and larvae/l). In both swimming pools, significant correlations were observed between some abiotic and biotic parameters. The waters of the studied swimming pools are subject to fecal pollution. Swimmers would therefore be exposed to biological contaminations, responsible for pathologies. The most common diseases are linked to gastroenteritis (diarrhea), but infections of all kinds may be overgrown (conjunctivitis, ear infections, dermatitis, respiratory infections).",Bacteria; Health Risks; Helminths; Protozoa; Swimming Pool; Aerobic Bacteria; Dermatitis; Health Risks; Lakes; Protozoa; Swimming Pools; Aerobic Heterotrophic Bacteria; Biological Contamination; Biological Treatment; Conventional Techniques; Fecal Streptococci; Pathogenic Strains; Pseudomonas Aeruginosa; Suspended Matters; Water Pollution; Bacterium; Health Risk; Parasite; Protozoan; Abiotic Stress; Acidity; Aerobic Bacterium; Article; Bacterial Load; Biotic Stress; Cameroon; Colony Forming Unit; Conjunctivitis; Correlation Analysis; Dermatitis; Diarrhea; Disease Association; Ear Infection; Fecal Coliform; Gastroenteritis; Health Hazard; Helminth; Larva; Mesophilic Bacterium; Microbiological Examination; Nonhuman; Oocyst; Physical Chemistry; Protozoon; Quantitative Analysis; Respiratory Tract Infection; Staphylococcus Aureus; Streptococcus; Suspended Particulate Matter; Swimming Pool; Water Contamination; Water Pollution; Water Sampling; Water Temperature; Water Treatment; Worm Egg; Animal; City; Environmental Monitoring; Microbiology; Centre [cameroon]; Yaounde; Bacteria (microorganisms); Vermes; Animals; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Swimming Pools; Water Microbiology,Aerobic bacteria; Dermatitis; Health risks; Lakes; Protozoa; Swimming pools; Aerobic heterotrophic bacteria; Biological contamination; Biological treatment; Conventional techniques; Fecal streptococci; Pathogenic strains; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Suspended matters; Water pollution; bacterium; health risk; parasite; protozoan; abiotic stress; acidity; aerobic bacterium; Article; bacterial load; biotic stress; Cameroon; colony forming unit; conjunctivitis; correlation analysis; dermatitis; diarrhea; disease association; ear infection; fecal coliform; gastroenteritis; health hazard; helminth; larva; mesophilic bacterium; microbiological examination; nonhuman; oocyst; physical chemistry; protozoon; quantitative analysis; respiratory tract infection; Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus; suspended particulate matter; swimming pool; water contamination; water pollution; water sampling; water temperature; water treatment; worm egg; animal; city; environmental monitoring; microbiology; Centre [Cameroon]; Yaounde; Bacteria (microorganisms); Vermes; Animals; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Swimming Pools; Water Microbiology,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,15732959; 01676369,,EMASD,33409600,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098853206

This paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presence and persistence in human excreta, wastewaters, sewage sludge as well as in natural water bodies, and the possible implications for water services in terms of fecal transmission, public health, and workers’ risk. Furthermore, the impacts related to the adopted containment and emergency management measures on household water consumptions are also discussed, together with the potential use of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) assessment as a monitoring and early warning tool, to be applied in case of infectious disease outbreaks. The knowledge and tools summarized in this paper provide a basic information reference, supporting decisions makers in the definition of suitable measures able to pursue an efficient water and wastewater management and a reduction of health risks. Furthermore, research questions are provided, in order to direct technical and public health communities towards a sustainable water service management in the event of a SARS-CoV-2 re-emergence, as well as a future deadly outbreak or pandemic.; The current knowledge on the SARS-CoV-2 in water services has been reviewed.

As a noted waterborne disease, emphasis has been given to the study VTEC in surface waters, readily susceptible to microbial contamination. Conversely, the status of VTEC in potable groundwater sources, generally regarded as a “safe” drinking-water supply remains largely understudied. As such, this investigation presents the first scoping review seeking to determine the global prevalence of VTEC in groundwater supply sources intended for human consumption. Twenty-three peer-reviewed studies were identified and included for data extraction. Groundwater sample and supply detection rates (estimated 0.6 and 1.3%, respectively) indicate VTEC is infrequently present in domestic groundwater sources. However, where generic (fecal indicator) E. coli are present, the VTEC to E. coli ratio was found to be 9.9%, representing a latent health concern for groundwater consumers. Geographically, extracted data indicates higher VTEC detection rates in urban (5.4%) and peri‑urban (4.9%) environments than in rural areas (0.9%); however, this finding is confounded by the predominance of research studies in lower income regions. Climate trends indicate local environments classified as ‘temperate’ (14/554; 2.5%) and ‘cold’ (8/392; 2%) accounted for a majority of supply sources with VTEC present, with similar detection rates encountered among supplies sampled during periods typically characterized by ‘high’ precipitation (15/649; 2.3%). Proposed prevalence figures may find application in preventive risk-based catchment and groundwater quality management including development of Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessments (QMRA). Notwithstanding, to an extent, a large geographical disparity in available investigations, lack of standardized reporting, and bias in source selection, restrict the transferability of research findings. Overall, the mechanisms responsible for VTEC transport and ingress into groundwater supplies remain ambiguous, representing a critical knowledge gap, and denoting a distinctive lack of integration between hydrogeological and public health research. Key recommendations and guidelines are provided for prospective studies directed at increasingly integrative and multi-disciplinary research.",Catchments; Data Mining; Groundwater; Groundwater Pollution; Groundwater Resources; Potable Water; Quality Management; Risk Assessment; Water Conservation; Water Quality; Water Supply; Detection Rates; E.

However, there are health risks and ecological risks associated with this practice. Small-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) intend to decrease these risks but still face management challenges. This study assessed how the management status of five small-scale WWTPs in Cochabamba, Bolivia affects health risks associated with consumption of lettuce and ecological risks due to the accumulation of nutrients in the soil for lettuce and maize crops. Risk simulations for three wastewater irrigation scenarios were: raw wastewater, actual effluent and expected effluent. Results showed that weak O&M practices can increase risk outcomes to higher levels than irrigating with raw wastewater.

While it is well accepted that wet weather contributes to this phenomenon, less is understood about the contribution of the complex hydrology in this low-lying coastal plain. A quantitative microbial assessment was conducted in Beaufort, North Carolina to identify trends and potential sources of fecal contamination in stormwater receiving waters. Fecal indicator concentrations were significantly higher in receiving water downstream of a tidally submerged outfall compared to an outfall that was permanently submerged (p < 0.001), though tidal height was not predictive of human-specific microbial source tracking (MST) marker concentrations at the tidally submerged site. Short-term rainfall (i.e. <12 h) was predictive of E. coli, Enterococcus spp., and human-specific MST marker concentrations (Fecal Bacteroides, BacHum, and HF183) in receiving waters. The strong correlation between 12-hr antecedent rainfall and Enterococcus spp. (r = 0.57, p < 0.001, n = 92) suggests a predictive model could be developed based on rainfall to communicate risk for bathers. Additional molecular marker data indicates that the delivery of fecal sources is complex and highly variable, likely due to the influence of tidal influx (saltwater intrusion from the estuary) into the low-lying stormwater pipes. In particular, elevated MST marker concentrations (up to 2.56 × 104 gene copies HF183/mL) were observed in standing water near surcharging street storm drain. These data are being used to establish a baseline for stormwater dynamics prior to dramatic rainfall in 2018 and to characterize the interaction between complex stormwater dynamics and water quality impairment in coastal NC.",Coastal Estuary; Microbial Source Tracking; Qpcr; Stormwater; Sewage; Contamination; Dynamics; Escherichia Coli; Outfalls; Predictive Analytics; Rain; Salt Water Intrusion; Sewage; Storm Sewers; Storms; Water Quality; Antecedent Rainfall; Fecal Contamination; Microbial Source Tracking; Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems; Predictive Modeling; Recreational Water Quality; Strong Correlation; Water Quality Impairment; River Pollution; Biological Marker; Rain; Salt Water; Storm Water; Coastal Zone; Concentration (composition); Estuary; Fecal Coliform; Sewage; Stormwater; Water Quality; Article; Bacterial Count; Bacteroides; Controlled Study; Correlation Analysis; Enterococcus; Feces; Infection Risk; Microbial Contamination; Microbial Source Tracking; Microbiological Examination; Nonhuman; North Carolina; Prediction; Predictive Model; Priority Journal; Quantitative Analysis; Quantitative Microbial Assessment; Recreation; Seashore; Statistical Model; Trend Study; Water Analysis; Environmental Monitoring; Human; Microbiology; Water Pollution; Beaufort; United States; Environmental Monitoring; Estuaries; Feces; Humans; Water Microbiology; Water Pollution; Water Quality,Contamination; Dynamics; Escherichia coli; Outfalls; Predictive analytics; Rain; Salt water intrusion; Sewage; Storm sewers; Storms; Water quality; Antecedent rainfall; Fecal contamination; Microbial source tracking; Municipal separate storm sewer systems; Predictive modeling; Recreational water quality; Strong correlation; Water quality impairment; River pollution; biological marker; rain; salt water; storm water; coastal zone; concentration (composition); estuary; fecal coliform; sewage; stormwater; water quality; Article; bacterial count; Bacteroides; controlled study; correlation analysis; Enterococcus; feces; infection risk; microbial contamination; microbial source tracking; microbiological examination; nonhuman; North Carolina; prediction; predictive model; priority journal; quantitative analysis; quantitative microbial assessment; recreation; seashore; statistical model; trend study; water analysis; environmental monitoring; human; microbiology; water pollution; Beaufort; United States; Environmental Monitoring; Estuaries; Feces; Humans; Water Microbiology; Water Pollution; Water Quality,,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,32795790,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089280225

Disease clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to severe multiple organ damage. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular receptor, which is abundantly expressed in the small intestine, allowing viral replication in the gastrointestinal tract. Viral RNA has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients and viable viruses had been isolated in some of these samples. Thus, a putative role of SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission has been argued. SARS-CoV-2 is shed in human excreta and further disposed in the sewerage or in the environment, in poor basic sanitation settings. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable population level approach for monitoring viral pathogens and has been successfully used in different contexts. This review summarizes the current global experience on SARS-CoV-2 WBE in distinct continents and viral detection in polluted surface water. The advantages and concerns of this strategy for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance are discussed. Outcomes suggest that WBE is a valuable early warning alert and a helpful complementary surveillance tool to subside public health response, to tailor containment and mitigation measures and to determine target populations for testing. In poor sanitation settings, contaminated rivers could be alternatively used as a source for environmental surveillance.",Fecal–oral Transmission; Public Health; Sars-cov-2; Surface Water; Wastewater; Wastewater-based Epidemiology; Waste Water; Drinking Water; Surface Water; Virus Rna; Covid-19; Disease Spread; Disease Transmission; Epidemiology; Fecal Coliform; Oral Health; Public Health; Viral Disease; Wastewater; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Human; Incidence; Infection Control; Middle East; Nonhuman; Pacific Islands; Pandemic; Prevalence; Review; River; Sanitation; Sentinel Surveillance; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Sewage; Sludge; Virus; Virus Detection; Virus Isolation; Virus Load; Virus Shedding; Virus Transmission; Waste Water; Waste Water Treatment Plant; Water Pollution; Isolation And Purification; Virology; Sars Coronavirus; Humans; Pandemics; Sanitation; Sars-cov-2; Waste Water; Wastewater-based Epidemiological Monitoring,drinking water; surface water; virus RNA; COVID-19; disease spread; disease transmission; epidemiology; fecal coliform; oral health; public health; viral disease; wastewater; coronavirus disease 2019; human; incidence; infection control; Middle East; nonhuman; Pacific islands; pandemic; prevalence; Review; river; sanitation; sentinel surveillance; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sewage; sludge; virus; virus detection; virus isolation; virus load; virus shedding; virus transmission; waste water; waste water treatment plant; water pollution; isolation and purification; virology; SARS coronavirus; Humans; Pandemics; Sanitation; SARS-CoV-2; Waste Water; Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring,,MDPI AG,16604601; 16617827,,,33321987,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097554319

We investigated to determine the outbreak scope and risk factors for transmission, and recommend evidence-based control measures. Methods: We defined a suspected case as sudden onset of watery diarrhoea in any person aged ≥ 2 years in Hoima District, 1 February–9 May 2018. A confirmed case was a suspected case with Vibrio cholerae cultured from a stool sample. We found cases by active community search and record reviews at Cholera Treatment Centres. We calculated case-fatality rates (CFR) and attack rates (AR) by sub-county and nationality. In a case-control study, we compared exposure factors among case- and control-households. We estimated the association between the exposures and outcome using Mantel-Haenszel method. We conducted an environmental assessment in the refugee settlement, including testing samples of stream water, tank water, and spring water for presence of fecal coliforms. We tested suspected cholera cases using cholera rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kits followed by culture for confirmation. Results: We identified 2122 case-patients and 44 deaths (CFR = 2.1%). Case-patients originating from Demographic Republic of Congo were the most affected (AR = 15/1000). The overall attack rate in Hoima District was 3.2/1000, with Kyangwali sub-county being the most affected (AR = 13/1000). The outbreak lasted 4 months, which was a multiple point-source. Environmental assessment showed that a stream separating two villages in Kyangwali Refugee Settlement was a site of open defecation for refugees. Among three water sources tested, only stream water was feacally-contaminated, yielding > 100 CFU/100 ml. Of 130 stool samples tested, 124 (95%) yielded V. cholerae by culture. Stream water was most strongly associated with illness (odds ratio [OR] = 14.2, 95% CI: 1.5–133), although tank water also appeared to be independently associated with illness (OR = 11.6, 95% CI: 1.4–94). Persons who drank tank and stream water had a 17-fold higher odds of illness compared with persons who drank from other sources (OR = 17.3, 95% CI: 2.2–137). Conclusions: Our investigation demonstrated that this was a prolonged cholera outbreak that affected four sub-counties and two divisions in Hoima District, and was associated with drinking of contaminated stream water. In addition, tank water also appears to be unsafe. We recommended boiling drinking water, increasing latrine coverage, and provision of safe water by the District and entire High Commission for refugees.","Cholera; Outbreak; Refugees; Uganda; Agar; Drinking Water; Tcbs; Agar; Tcbs; Drinking Water; Adult; Aged; Agglutination Test; Article; Case Control Study; Case Fatality Rate; Child; Cholera; Colony Forming Unit; Controlled Study; Diarrhea; Disease Transmission; Environmental Microbiology; Feces Culture; Female; Household; Human; Major Clinical Study; Male; Mantel Haenszel Test; Priority Journal; Refugee Camp; Risk Factor; Serotype; Vibrio Cholerae; Water Contamination; Adolescent; Epidemic; Feces; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Middle Aged; Preschool Child; Refugee; River; Uganda; Very Elderly; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 And Over; Case-control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Cholera; Diarrhea; Disease Outbreaks; Drinking Water; Feces; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Refugees; Risk Factors; Rivers; Water Microbiology; Young Adult","agar; tcbs; drinking water; adult; aged; agglutination test; Article; case control study; case fatality rate; child; cholera; colony forming unit; controlled study; diarrhea; disease transmission; environmental microbiology; feces culture; female; household; human; major clinical study; male; Mantel Haenszel test; priority journal; refugee camp; risk factor; serotype; Vibrio cholerae; water contamination; adolescent; epidemic; feces; isolation and purification; microbiology; middle aged; preschool child; refugee; river; Uganda; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Cholera; Diarrhea; Disease Outbreaks; Drinking Water; Feces; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Refugees; Risk Factors; Rivers; Water Microbiology; Young Adult",,BioMed Central Ltd,20499957; 20955162,,,33148338,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85094956104

However, the enforcement of a nationwide lockdown due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic can possibly provide a ray of hope. We analyze the lockdown's impact on the water quality status of this stretch using a combination of measured parameters and satellite image derived indices. Class C Water Quality Index estimates of nine stations indicate an improvement of 37% during the lockdown period. The Biological Oxygen Demand and Chemical Oxygen Demand values reduced by 42.83% and 39.25%, respectively, compared to the pre-lockdown phase, while Faecal Coliform declined by over 40%. Similar analysis of 20 major drains that meet the Yamuna revealed declining effluent loads and discernable improvements in drain contaminant status were ascertained via a hierarchical cluster analysis. Reach-wise suspended particulate matter content, turbidity and algal signatures were derived from multi-temporal Landsat-8 images of prior and ongoing lockdown periods for 117 channel segment zones. These parameters also declined notably within most stretches, although their extents were spatially varied. While the partial/non-operational status of most industries during the lockdown enabled significant reduction in effluent loads and a consequent betterment in the river water quality, its spatial variations and even deterioration in some locations resulted from the largely undiminished inflow of domestic sewage through multiple drains. This study provides an estimate of possible river recovery extents and degree of improvement if deleterious polluting activities and contaminants are regulated properly.","Algae Signature; Coronavirus Pandemic; Environmental Pollution; River Health; Stream Ecological Conditions; Turbidity Measurement; Biochemical Oxygen Demand; C (programming Language); Deterioration; Effluents; Hierarchical Clustering; Hierarchical Systems; Image Segmentation; Oxygen; Rivers; Sewage; Wastewater Disposal; Water Quality; Biological Oxygen Demand; Measured Parameters; River Water Quality; Satellite Images; Similar Analysis; Spatial Variations; Suspended Particulate Matters; Water Quality Indexes; River Pollution; River Water; Biochemical Oxygen Demand; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Coliform Bacterium; Covid-19; Environmental Impact Assessment; Landsat; Parameterization; Respiratory Disease; Satellite Imagery; Spatial Analysis; Water Quality; Article; Comparative Study; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Fecal Coliform; Human; Industry And Industrial Phenomena; National Capital Territory Of Delhi; Pandemic; Particulate Matter; Priority Journal; Quarantine; River Ecosystem; Sewage; Turbidity; Water Analysis; Water Contamination; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infection; Environmental Monitoring; India; River; Virus Pneumonia; Delhi; Algae; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Water Quality","Biochemical oxygen demand; C (programming language); Deterioration; Effluents; Hierarchical clustering; Hierarchical systems; Image segmentation; Oxygen; Rivers; Sewage; Wastewater disposal; Water quality; Biological oxygen demand; Measured parameters; River water quality; Satellite images; Similar analysis; Spatial variations; Suspended particulate matters; Water quality indexes; River pollution; river water; biochemical oxygen demand; chemical oxygen demand; coliform bacterium; COVID-19; environmental impact assessment; Landsat; parameterization; respiratory disease; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; water quality; Article; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; fecal coliform; human; industry and industrial phenomena; National Capital Territory of Delhi; pandemic; particulate matter; priority journal; quarantine; river ecosystem; sewage; turbidity; water analysis; water contamination; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; India; river; virus pneumonia; Delhi; algae; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Water Quality",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,32755777,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088903756

UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 aims to address this issue. Tryptophan-like fluorescence (TLF) shows potential as a rapid method for detecting microbial contamination in drinking water, which could reduce the spread of waterborne diseases. This study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of TLF for a large-scale survey using a randomised, spot-sampling approach. The large-scale survey took place in Malawi, sub-Saharan Africa, in the dry season (n = 183). A subset of sources were revisited at the end of the following wet season (n = 41). The effectiveness of TLF was assessed by comparing TLF results to thermotolerant coliforms (TTC), humic-like fluorescence (HLF), inorganic hydrochemical data and sanitary risk scores. The most prominent differences in microbial water quality were observed between source types, with little variation between districts and seasons. TLF, TTCs, turbidity and sanitary risk scores were all elevated at alternative sources (shallow wells and tap stands) compared to hand-pumped boreholes. In the dry season, 18% of hand-pumped boreholes showed TTC contamination, which increase to 21% in the wet season. Groundwater recharge processes are likely responsible for seasonal variability of inorganic hydrochemistry at hand-pumped boreholes. TLF was able to distinguish no and low WHO risk classes (TTC 0–9 cfu/100 mL) from medium, high and very high risk classes (TTC 10 – >1000 cfu/100 mL). TLF failed to distinguish between no and low risk classes, which limits the use of TLF for assessing water quality to drinking water standards. This dataset indicates that HLF may raise baseline TLF for samples with low TLF values, increasing false positives.

A total of 58 dug wells (42 installed by a government organization (GO) and 16 installed by a non-government organization (NGO)) were sampled in the dry and wet seasons. The samples were evaluated for total coliform (TC), faecal coliform (FC) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Sanitary inspections of the surroundings of the GO-installed dug wells identified the sources of faecal contamination. Both the GO-installed and NGO-installed dug wells had bacterial contamination. The median concentrations of E. coli among the GO-installed and NGO-installed dug wells were, respectively, 41 and 21 cfu/100 ml in the wet season, and respectively 2 and <1 cfu/100 ml in the dry season. In the wet season, 24 and 31%, respectively, of the GO-installed and NGO-installed dug wells were in the high-risk category. All of the dug wells had higher disease burden in the wet season compared to the dry season. The findings suggest that drinking water from the dug wells is likely to pose health risks to the rural communities.",Drinking Water; Dug Well; Indicator Bacteria; Risk Assessment; Water Quality; Drought; Escherichia Coli; Health Risks; Potable Water; Bacterial Contamination; Bacteriological Quality; Escherichia Coli (e.

The pilot plant consists of two stages of vertical flow CWs plus one stage of a horizontal CW built in 2018 with different local materials at the Gaston Berger University Campus, Saint Louis (Senegal). Each CW stage is composed of several filters with different type of media (silex, granite, or river gravel), filtering media depths, and macrophytes (Phragmites and Typha). The physicochemical and microbiological indicators were monitored over six months at each bed inlet and outlet to evaluate the efficiency and achievements of the Senegalese, European, and WHO regulations/recommendations for disposal or reuse in irrigation. This study demonstrates the viability of this new multistage CW design to treat raw municipal wastewater and produce an effluent of good quality suitable for reuse in agriculture. The removal of organic matter, suspended solids, and nutrients was very high (>95% for SS, BOD<inf>5</inf> and N-NH<inf>4</inf>+, >90% for COD and P-PO<inf>4</inf>3−), as was the reduction of microbiological indicators (fecal coliform reduction >5 log units and helminth egg removal of 100%). First, trends related to the influence of design (the type of gravel, filter depth, and type of macrophyte), operational modes, and the CW treatment efficiency were determined. The use of non-crushed gravel and Typha spp. seemed to provide better removal rates. On the contrary, no differences were found between the use of silex or granite gravel. For the studied Senegalese conditions under dry and hot climates, the preliminary results indicate that no resting periods are necessary for vertical flow CWs (VFCWs), thus resulting in a reduction in construction and operation costs. The main outcome of our study is evidence that multistage CWs can provide robust, cost-effective treatments, as well as allow for safe water reuse, which is imperative in areas with severe water scarcity and endemic microbiological waterborne diseases.",Agriculture; Arid Regions; Constructed Wetlands; Sanitation; Wastewater Reuse; Agricultural Robots; Cost Effectiveness; Efficiency; Effluents; Granite; Gravel; Irrigation; Pilot Plants; Wastewater Disposal; Wastewater Reclamation; Water Conservation; Wetlands; Agricultural Irrigation; Constructed Wetlands; Cost Effective Treatments; Municipal Wastewater Treatment; Municipal Wastewaters; Treatment Efficiency; University Campus; Water-borne Disease; Wastewater Treatment; Agricultural Emission; Constructed Wetland; Cost-benefit Analysis; Design Method; Effluent; Granite; Operations Technology; Regulatory Approach; Vertical Mixing; Wastewater Treatment; Saint Louis [senegal]; Senegal; Phragmites; Vermes,Agricultural robots; Cost effectiveness; Efficiency; Effluents; Granite; Gravel; Irrigation; Pilot plants; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Wetlands; Agricultural irrigation; Constructed wetlands; Cost effective treatments; Municipal wastewater treatment; Municipal wastewaters; Treatment efficiency; University campus; Water-borne disease; Wastewater treatment; agricultural emission; constructed wetland; cost-benefit analysis; design method; effluent; granite; operations technology; regulatory approach; vertical mixing; wastewater treatment; Saint Louis [Senegal]; Senegal; Phragmites; Vermes,,MDPI AG,20734441,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096354118

We hereby present the imprints of lockdown on water quality (both chemical and biological) parameters during the nationwide lockdown (COVID-19 epidemic) in India between 25th March to 30th May 2020. The present study describes the changes in chemical and biological water quality parameters based on twenty-two groundwater samples from the coastal industrial city of Tuticorin in Southern India, taken before (10 and 11th February 2020) and during the lockdown (19 and 20th April 2020) periods. The physico-chemical parameters compared are pH, total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC), nitrate (NO<inf>3</inf>), fluoride (F), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and selenium (Se), and the bacterial parameters are total coliforms, fecal coliforms, E. coli, and fecal streptococci. Among the metals, the significant reductions in Se (42%), As (51%), Fe (60%) and Pb (50%) were noticed probably owing to no or very less wastewater discharges from metal-based industries, seafood-based industries and thermal power plants during the lockdown. Reduction in NO<inf>3</inf> (56%), total coliform (52%) and fecal coliforms (48%) indicated less organic sewage from the fishing industries. Contents of Cr, Cu, Zn and Cd, however, remained similar and fluoride did not show any change, probably as they were sourced from rock-water interactions. Similarly, we did not observe alterations in E. coli and fecal streptococci due to no significant change in domestic sewage production during the lockdown. The multivariate analyses aptly illustrated this and the principal component analyses helped to identify the sources that controlled water qualities of the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown period. Our observation implies that groundwater is definitely under active interaction with surface waters and thus a quick revival could be observed following the seizing of anthropogenic activities.","Covid-19; Heavy Metal; Lockdown, Tuticorin, India; Organic Pollutant; Arsenic; Cadmium; Copper; Fluoride; Iron; Lead; Nitrate; Selenium; Zinc; Metals, Heavy; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Escherichia Coli; Fisheries; Fluorine Compounds; Groundwater; Image Enhancement; Multivariant Analysis; Principal Component Analysis; Sewage; Thermoelectric Power Plants; Water Quality; Anthropogenic Activity; Chemical And Biologicals; Electrical Conductivity; Environmental Improvements; Multi Variate Analysis; Physico - Chemical Parameters; Rock Water Interaction; Total Dissolved Solids; Hydrochemistry; Arsenic; Cadmium; Copper; Fluoride; Ground Water; Iron; Lead; Nitrate; Selenium; Surface Water; Zinc; Heavy Metal; Biological Analysis; Chemical Analysis; Epidemic; Groundwater; Physicochemical Property; Water Chemistry; Water Quality; Article; Chemical Parameters; Coastal Waters; Coliform Bacterium; Controlled Study; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Demography; Electric Conductivity; Fecal Coliform; Geographic Distribution; Human; India; Industrial Area; Nonhuman; Pandemic; Ph; Physical Chemistry; Priority Journal; Quarantine; Sewage; Streptococcus; Water Sampling; Betacoronavirus; City; Coronavirus Infection; Environmental Monitoring; Virus Pneumonia; Water Pollutant; Tamil Nadu; Tuticorin; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality","Escherichia coli; Fisheries; Fluorine compounds; Groundwater; Image enhancement; Multivariant analysis; Principal component analysis; Sewage; Thermoelectric power plants; Water quality; Anthropogenic activity; Chemical and biologicals; Electrical conductivity; Environmental improvements; Multi variate analysis; Physico - chemical parameters; Rock water interaction; Total dissolved solids; Hydrochemistry; arsenic; cadmium; copper; fluoride; ground water; iron; lead; nitrate; selenium; surface water; zinc; heavy metal; biological analysis; chemical analysis; epidemic; groundwater; physicochemical property; water chemistry; water quality; Article; chemical parameters; coastal waters; coliform bacterium; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; electric conductivity; fecal coliform; geographic distribution; human; India; industrial area; nonhuman; pandemic; pH; physical chemistry; priority journal; quarantine; sewage; Streptococcus; water sampling; Betacoronavirus; city; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; virus pneumonia; water pollutant; Tamil Nadu; Tuticorin; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,32574914,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086628872

On 10 May 2018, staff at the north Delhi district surveillance unit identified a laboratory-confirmed cholera outbreak when five people tested positive for Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa serotype in Bhadola. We investigated to identify risk factors and recommend prevention measures. Methods:We defined a case as ≥3 loose stools within 24 h in a Bhadola resident during 1 April-29 May 2018. We searched for cases house-to-house. In a 1 : 1 unmatched case control study, a controlwas defined as an absence of loose stools in a Bhadola resident during 1 April-29 May 2018. We selected cases and controls randomly. We tested stool samples for Vibrio cholerae by culture. We tested drinking water for fecal contamination. Using multivariable logistic regression we calculated adjusted ORs (aORs) with 95% CIs. Results: We identified 129 cases; the median age was 14.5 y, 52% were females, 27% were hospitalized and there were no deaths. Symptoms were abdominal pain (54%), vomiting (44%) and fever (29%). Among 90 cases and controls, the odds of illness were higher for drinking untreated municipal water (aOR=2.3; 95% CI 1.0 to 6.2) and not knowing about diarrhea transmission (aOR=4.9; 95% CI 1.0 to 21.1). Of 12 stool samples, 6 (50%) tested positive for Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa serotype. Of 15 water samples, 8 (53%) showed growth of fecal coliforms. Conclusions: This laboratory-confirmed cholera outbreak associated with drinking untreated municipal water and lack of knowledge of diarrhea transmission triggered public health action in Bhadola, Delhi.",Delhi; Outbreak; Untreated Water; Vibrio Cholerae 01; Drinking Water; Sewage; Drinking Water; Abdominal Pain; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Article; Bacterial Growth; Bacterium Culture; Case Control Study; Child; Cholera; Controlled Study; Disease Transmission; Epidemic; Female; Fever; Human; India; Infant; Loose Feces; Major Clinical Study; Male; Newborn; Risk Factor; Vomiting; Water Sampling; Feces; Genetics; Hygiene; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Sanitation; Serotype; Sewage; Vibrio Cholerae O1; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Case-control Studies; Cholera; Disease Outbreaks; Drinking Water; Feces; Female; Humans; Hygiene; Male; Sanitation; Serogroup; Sewage; Young Adult,drinking water; abdominal pain; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; bacterial growth; bacterium culture; case control study; child; cholera; controlled study; disease transmission; epidemic; female; fever; human; India; infant; loose feces; major clinical study; male; newborn; risk factor; vomiting; water sampling; feces; genetics; hygiene; isolation and purification; microbiology; sanitation; serotype; sewage; Vibrio cholerae O1; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Cholera; Disease Outbreaks; Drinking Water; Feces; Female; Humans; Hygiene; Male; Sanitation; Serogroup; Sewage; Young Adult,,Oxford University Press,18783503; 00359203,,TRSTA,32797205,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092681967

Nutrient enrichment from agricultural pollution increases disease pressure in many host-pathogen systems, but the mechanisms underlying this pattern are not always resolved. For example, nutrient enrichment should strongly influence pools of aquatic environmental bacteria, which has the potential to alter microbiome composition of aquatic animals and their vulnerability to disease. However, shifts in the host microbiome have received little attention as a link between nutrient enrichment and diseases of aquatic organisms. We examined nutrient enrichment through the widespread practice of integrated pig-fish farming and its effects on microbiome composition of Brazilian amphibians and prevalence of the globally distributed amphibian skin pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). This farming system drove surges in fecal coliform bacteria, disturbing amphibian skin bacterial communities such that hosts recruited higher proportions of Bd-facilitative bacteria and carried higher Bd prevalence.

However, much of the world's population lacks access to adequate and safe water. Approximately 884,000, 000 people in the world still do not get their drinking water from safe sources; Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for over one third of this number. It is estimated that 80% of all illnesses in the world are related to use of unsafe and contaminated water. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from August 1st 2017 to July 30th 2018 in three randomly selected woreda (districts) of Eastern Zone Tigrai. Water samples were examined for total coliforms and thermotelorant coliforms using the most probable number method. Standard biochemical testing was performed on samples that tested positive to identify the genus of bacteria. The contaminant risk of water sources were assessed using the sanitary inspection checklist of the World Health Organization. The results were interpreted using World Health Organization guidelines for drinking water quality. Data was collected using laboratory checklist and sanitary inspection check list. It was entered, cleared and analyzed using SPSS version 21.0 and a variable having a P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant in all tests. Results: A total of 290 drinking water samples were analyzed for bacteriological quality. A total of 32.4% (n = 94) of water sources showed contamination with faecal and total coliforms. Of these 3.4% (n = 10) samples were contaminated with total coliforms and 29% (n = 84) contaminated with faecal coliforms. The leading water contaminant organisms were Escherichia coli (62.4%), Legionella species (8.5%), and Shigella species (7.5%) respectively. Based on WHO criteria, 15% of water sources were grouped in the very high risk group. Animal excreta and inadequate fencing of water sources were significantly associated with water contamination rate. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that most water sources in woredas of Eastern Tigrai are contaminated by faecal coliforms. Therefore, regular sanitary inspection, bacteriological analysis, and adequate fencing should be mandatory to protect drinking water sources from faecal contamination.",Bacteriological Quality; Ethiopia; Faecal Coliforms; Tigrai; Total Coliforms; Water Sources; Drinking Water; Article; Bacterial Count; Bacteriological Quality; Biochemical Analysis; Coliform Bacterium; Controlled Study; Cross-sectional Study; Environmental Sanitation; Escherichia Coli; Ethiopia; Fecal Coliform; Heat Tolerance; High Risk Population; Legionella; Microbiological Examination; Microbiological Parameters; Most Probable Number Method; Nonhuman; Priority Journal; Protection; Pseudomonas; Risk Factor; Shigella; Water Analysis; Water Contamination; Water Quality; Water Sampling; Water Standard; Water Supply; World Health Organization; Yersinia,drinking water; Article; bacterial count; bacteriological quality; biochemical analysis; coliform bacterium; controlled study; cross-sectional study; environmental sanitation; Escherichia coli; Ethiopia; fecal coliform; heat tolerance; high risk population; Legionella; microbiological examination; microbiological parameters; most probable number method; nonhuman; priority journal; protection; Pseudomonas; risk factor; Shigella; water analysis; water contamination; water quality; water sampling; water standard; water supply; World Health Organization; Yersinia,,BioMed Central Ltd,20550936,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092060982

This study is aimed to investigate and develop spatial distribution mapping of the potable water quality parameters in the city of Peshawar, Pakistan. A total of 108 water samples collected across the entire study area were subjected to physio-chemical and biological analyses. Tested parameters included pH, turbidity, temperature, fluoride concentration levels, and bacterial counts (faecal coliforms). Inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation in geographic information systems (GIS) was used for spatial analysis. Test results revealed that 48% of water samples had faecal coliforms count (per 100 mL) greater than World Health Organization (WHO) minimum limits, while 31% of samples had fluoride concentrations in excess of the WHO maximum guide values. Spatial distribution mapping was developed for faecal coliforms count and fluoride ion concentration using ArcGIS to highlight the high-risk settlements in the study area. Results showed that around 20% area under faecal coliforms and approximately 33% area based on fluoride concentrations fall under the need for treatment category. The pH and turbidity were found in compliance with WHO desirable limits. The sanitary inspection score significantly depicted that ineffective multi-barrier approaches consequently deteriorated the water quality at the consumer's end.

Parameters to measure the presence or absence of Salmonella, Staphylococcus, coliform, fungi, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, and total viable counts in foods were studied. Enumeration of aerobic mesophilic bacteria and coliform bacteria was carried out to check the quality of water. The results showed that there was microbial contamination in the foods served at hospital under investigation for this study. Most of the contamination existed because of nonhygienic practices by individuals and serving places. Salmonella, fecal coliforms, and fungal cross-contamination was reported. A hazard analysis and critical control point system was implemented to study what areas are at greater risk and are a reason of contamination in the hospital. The study concluded that high prevalence of the microbial contamination was observed in facilities of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences hospital, requiring strict preventive and precautionary measures to be taken to ensure the safety and health of patients and attendants in the hospital.","Foodborne Diseases; Hazard Analysis And Critical Control Point System; Hospital; Microbial Contamination; Safety; Bacterial Count; Food Contamination; Food Control; Hazard Assessment; Hospital; Human; Pakistan; Salmonella; Colony Count, Microbial; Food Contamination; Food Microbiology; Hazard Analysis And Critical Control Points; Hospitals; Humans","bacterial count; food contamination; food control; hazard assessment; hospital; human; Pakistan; Salmonella; Colony Count, Microbial; Food Contamination; Food Microbiology; Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points; Hospitals; Humans",,International Association for Food Protection lhovey@foodprotection.org,19449097; 0362028X,,JFPRD,32693410,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088501186

We evaluated three different source water chlorination programs (bucket, in-line, and piped water chlorination) in the ongoing humanitarian response in Cox's Bazar refugee camps in Bangladesh. We used a mixed-methods research protocol including key informant interviews, water point observations, focus group discussions, household surveys, and water quality testing. The three evaluated programs were implemented at different response stages and required different levels of staffing, infrastructure, and community mobilization work. In the bucket chlorination program, highly contaminated open well water was chlorinated, in in-line and piped water chlorination programs, groundwater was treated. Overall, 71% of bucket, 36% of in-line, and 60% of piped water chlorination households had stored water that met free chlorine residual (FCR) criteria, respectively. Additionally, 71% of bucket, 86% of in-line, and 91% of piped water chlorination households had stored water that met Escherichia coli (E. coli) criteria (<10 E. coli CFU/100 mL). Regression results indicate presence of FCR, serving water by pouring, and higher source water pH were associated with meeting E. coli criteria. Our results highlight: no individual program fully met international standards as implemented, although each partially met standards; the importance of understanding beneficiary preferences and behavior change campaigns; and, the benefits and drawbacks of each source water chlorination program must be considered before implementation. Overall, we found appropriate source water chlorination program choice is a continuum, depending on humanitarian phase and context. Therefore, we recommend continuing context- and phase-appropriate source water chlorination programs, emphasizing consistent and acceptable chlorine dosage, implementing programmatic improvements, and incorporating user preferences to reduce microbial contamination and consequently the risk of waterborne diseases.",Bucket Chlorination; Emergency-transition Continuum; Humanitarian Response; In-line Chlorination; Piped Network; Water Treatment; Calcium; Drinking Water; Chlorination; Groundwater; Groundwater Pollution; Potable Water; Surveys; Water Quality; Water Treatment; Bucket Chlorination; Chlorine Residuals; Emergency-transition Continuum; Free Chlorine; Humanitarian Response; In-line Chlorination; Piped Network; Safe Drinking Water; Source Waters; Water Chlorination; Escherichia Coli; Calcium; Surface Water; Drinking Water; Chlorination; Fecal Coliform; Household Survey; Humanitarian Aid; Questionnaire Survey; Refugee; Regression Analysis; Water Treatment; Waterborne Disease; Aquifer; Article; Behavior Change; Color; Fluid Intake; Household; Human; Job Security; Odor; Perception; Ph; Priority Journal; Refugee Camp; Solar Energy; Summer; Taste; Turbidity; Water Quality; Water Supply; Bangladesh; Emergency; Halogenation; Microbiology; Water Management; Cox's Bazar; Drinking Water; Emergencies; Halogenation; Humans; Water Microbiology; Water Purification; Water Supply,Chlorination; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Potable water; Surveys; Water quality; Water treatment; Bucket chlorination; Chlorine residuals; Emergency-transition continuum; Free chlorine; Humanitarian response; In-line chlorination; Piped network; Safe drinking water; Source waters; Water chlorination; Escherichia coli; calcium; surface water; drinking water; chlorination; fecal coliform; household survey; humanitarian aid; questionnaire survey; refugee; regression analysis; water treatment; waterborne disease; aquifer; Article; behavior change; color; fluid intake; household; human; job security; odor; perception; pH; priority journal; refugee camp; solar energy; summer; taste; turbidity; water quality; water supply; Bangladesh; emergency; halogenation; microbiology; water management; Cox's Bazar; Drinking Water; Emergencies; Halogenation; Humans; Water Microbiology; Water Purification; Water Supply,,Elsevier Ltd,00431354; 18792448,,WATRA,32361348,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083857135

In this work we describe the occurrence of antibiotic resistant faecal coliforms and their mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in the effluent of two urban WWTPs in Ireland. This information is critical to identifying the role of WWTPs in the dissemination of ARB and ARGs into the environment. Effluent samples were collected from two WWTPs in Spring and Autumn of 2015 and 2016. The bacterial susceptibility patterns to 13 antibiotics were determined. The phenotypic tests were carried out to identify AmpC or extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers. The presence of ESBL genes were detected by PCR. Plasmids carrying ESBL genes were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α recipient and underwent plasmid replicon typing to identify incompatibility groups. More than 90% of isolated faecal coliforms were resistant to amoxicillin and ampicillin, followed by tetracycline (up to 39.82%), ciprofloxacin (up to 31.42%) and trimethoprim (up to 37.61%). Faecal coliforms resistant to colistin (up to 31.62%) and imipenem (up to 15.93%) were detected in all effluent samples. Up to 53.98% of isolated faecal coliforms expressed a multi-drug resistance (MRD) phenotype. AmpC production was confirmed in 5.22% of isolates. The ESBL genes were confirmed for 11.84% of isolates (9.2% of isolates carried bla<inf>TEM</inf>, 1.4% bla<inf>SHV-12</inf>, 0.2% bla<inf>CTX-M-1</inf> and 1% bla<inf>CTX-M-15</inf>). Plasmids extracted from 52 ESBL isolates were successfully transformed into recipient E. coli. The detected plasmid incompatibility groups included the IncF group, IncI1, IncHI1/2 and IncA/C. These results provide evidence that treated wastewater is polluted with ARB and MDR faecal coliforms and are sources of ESBL-producing, carbapenem and colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae.",Ampc; Antibiotic Resistance; Extended-spectrum Β-lactamase (esbl); Multidrug Resistance; Plasmids; Amoxicillin; Ampicillin; Carbapenem; Cefotaxime; Ceftazidime; Chloramphenicol; Ciprofloxacin; Colistin; Gentamicin; Imipenem; Kanamycin; Meropenem; Tetracycline; Trimethoprim; Beta Lactamase; Anti-bacterial Agents; Beta-lactamases; Waste Water; Antibiotics; Biomarkers; Dna; Effluent Treatment; Escherichia Coli; Genes; Sewage Pumping Plants; Wastewater Treatment; Water Treatment Plants; Ampc; Antibiotic Resistance; Lactamases; Multidrug Resistance; Plasmids; Effluents; Amoxicillin; Ampicillin; Carbapenem; Cefotaxime; Ceftazidime; Chloramphenicol; Ciprofloxacin; Colistin; Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase; Gentamicin; Imipenem; Kanamycin; Meropenem; Tetracycline; Trimethoprim; Antiinfective Agent; Beta Lactamase; Antibiotic Resistance; Effluent; Fecal Coliform; Phenotype; Plasmid; Wastewater Treatment Plant; Agar Dilution; Antibiotic Sensitivity; Article; Autumn; Bacterium Isolate; Enzyme Synthesis; Ireland; Multidrug Resistance; Nonhuman; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Prevalence; Spring; Urban Area; Waste Water Treatment Plant; Escherichia Coli Infection; Genetics; Human; Waste Water; Bacteria (microorganisms); Enterobacteriaceae; Anti-bacterial Agents; Beta-lactamases; Escherichia Coli Infections; Humans; Waste Water,Antibiotics; Biomarkers; DNA; Effluent treatment; Escherichia coli; Genes; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; AmpC; Antibiotic resistance; Lactamases; Multidrug resistance; Plasmids; Effluents; amoxicillin; ampicillin; carbapenem; cefotaxime; ceftazidime; chloramphenicol; ciprofloxacin; colistin; extended spectrum beta lactamase; gentamicin; imipenem; kanamycin; meropenem; tetracycline; trimethoprim; antiinfective agent; beta lactamase; antibiotic resistance; effluent; fecal coliform; phenotype; plasmid; wastewater treatment plant; agar dilution; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; autumn; bacterium isolate; enzyme synthesis; Ireland; multidrug resistance; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; spring; urban area; waste water treatment plant; Escherichia coli infection; genetics; human; waste water; Bacteria (microorganisms); Enterobacteriaceae; Anti-Bacterial Agents; beta-Lactamases; Escherichia coli Infections; Humans; Waste Water,,Elsevier Ltd,18736424; 02697491,,ENPOE,32146363,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081040537

Heightened incidence of waterborne disease outbreaks related to recreational use and source water contamination is associated with extreme rainfall events. Such extreme events are predicted to increase in some regions due to climate change. Consequently, municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) conveying pathogens to receiving waters are a growing public health concern. In addition, the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotic resistant bacteria in various environmental matrices, including urban runoff, is an emerging threat. The resistome and microbiota profile of MS4 discharges has yet to be fully characterized. To address this knowledge gap, we first analyzed the relationship between rainfall depth and intensity and E. coli densities (fecal indicator) in stormwater from four MS4 outflows in Columbus, Ohio, USA during the spring and summer of 2017. Microbial source tracking (MST) was conducted to examine major fecal contamination sources in the study sewersheds. A subset of samples was analyzed for microbial and resistome profiles using a metagenomic approach. The results showed a significant positive relationship between outflow E. coli density and rainfall intensity. MST results indicate prevalent fecal contamination from ruminant populations in the study sites (91% positive among the samples tested). Protobacteria and Actinobacteria were two dominant bacteria at a phylum level. A diverse array of ARGs and potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Salmonella enterica Typhimurium), fungi (e.g. Scedosporium apiospermum), and protists (e.g. Acanthamoeba palestinensis) were found in urban stormwater outflows that discharge into adjacent streams. The most prevalent ARGs among samples were β-lactam resistance genes and the most predominant virulence genes within bacterial community were related with Staphylococcus aureus. A comprehensive contamination profile indicates a need for sustainable strategies to manage urban stormwater runoff amid increasingly intense rainfall events to protect public and environmental health.","Carbapenem Resistance; Microbial Source Tracking; Protists; Resistome; Sewershed; Virulence Factor; Tetracycline; Antibiotics; Biomarkers; Climate Change; Contamination; Escherichia Coli; Genes; Rain; Runoff; Salmonella; Sewage; Staphylococcus Aureus; Storm Sewers; Storms; Water Supply Systems; Carbapenems; Microbial Source Tracking; Protists; Resistome; Sewershed; Virulence Factors; Water Pollution; Aminoglycoside; Antibiotic Agent; Beta Lactam Antibiotic; Macrolide; Rain; Storm Water; Surface Water; Tetracycline; Antibiotic Resistance; Biome; Fecal Coliform; Pollutant Source; Protist; Runoff; Sewer Network; Stormwater; Virulence; Acanthamoeba Palestinensis; Actinobacteria; Article; Climate Change; Controlled Study; Environmental Factor; Evapotranspiration; Incidence; Metagenomics; Microbial Community; Microbiome; Nonhuman; Prevalence; Priority Journal; Public Health; Residential Home; Salmonella Enterica Serovar Typhimurium; Scedosporium Apiospermum; Sewer; Stormwater Runoff; United States; Urban Area; Water Contamination; Environmental Monitoring; Microbiology; Microflora; Ohio; Columbus [ohio]; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Protista; Pseudallescheria Boydii; Salmonella Enterica; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Environmental Monitoring; Microbiota; Water Microbiology","Antibiotics; Biomarkers; Climate change; Contamination; Escherichia coli; Genes; Rain; Runoff; Salmonella; Sewage; Staphylococcus aureus; Storm sewers; Storms; Water supply systems; Carbapenems; Microbial source tracking; Protists; Resistome; Sewershed; Virulence factors; Water pollution; aminoglycoside; antibiotic agent; beta lactam antibiotic; macrolide; rain; storm water; surface water; tetracycline; antibiotic resistance; biome; fecal coliform; pollutant source; protist; runoff; sewer network; stormwater; virulence; Acanthamoeba palestinensis; Actinobacteria; Article; climate change; controlled study; environmental factor; evapotranspiration; incidence; metagenomics; microbial community; microbiome; nonhuman; prevalence; priority journal; public health; residential home; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; Scedosporium apiospermum; sewer; stormwater runoff; United States; urban area; water contamination; environmental monitoring; microbiology; microflora; Ohio; Columbus [Ohio]; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Protista; Pseudallescheria boydii; Salmonella enterica; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Environmental Monitoring; Microbiota; Water Microbiology",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,32392682,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082858940

Indirect potable reuse (IPR) represents a promising alternative water source in water-stressed regions. Of high concern is the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater, such as enteric viruses, protozoa and bacteria. Therefore, a greater understanding of the potential impact to human health is required. The aim of this research was to use a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) approach to calculate the probability of potential pathogen infection risk to the public in surface waters used for a range of recreational activities under scenarios: 1) existing de facto wastewater reuse conditions; 2) after augmentation with conventionally treated wastewater; and 3) after augmentation with reclaimed wastewater from proposed IPR schemes. Forty-four 31 l samples were collected from river sites and a coastal wastewater treatment works from July 2016–May 2017. Concentrations of faecal indicator organisms (enterococci, faecal coliforms, somatic coliphages and Bacteroides phages) determined using culture-based approaches and selected pathogens (adenovirus, Salmonella and Cryptosporidium) determined using molecular approaches (qPCR) were used to inform QMRA. The mean probability of infection from adenovirus under de facto conditions was high (>0.90) for all recreational activities, per single event. The risk of adenovirus and Cryptosporidium infection increased under augmentation scenario (2) (mean probability 0.95–1.00 and 0.01–0.06 per single event, respectively). Adenovirus and Cryptosporidium infection risk decreased under reclaimed water augmentation scenario (3) (mean probability <0.79, excluding swimming, which remained 1.00 and <0.01 per single event, respectively). Pathogen reduction after reclaimed water augmentation in surface waters impacted by de facto reuse, provides important evidence for alternative water supply option selection. As such, this evidence may inform water managers and the public of the potential benefits of IPR and improve acceptance of such practices in the future.",Adenovirus; Augmentation; Cryptosporidium; Human Health; Recreation; Salmonella; Water Reuse; Drinking Water; Waste Water; Climate Change; Pathogens; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Potable Water; Risk Assessment; Risk Perception; Salmonella; Surface Waters; Viruses; Wastewater Reclamation; Wastewater Treatment; Water Supply; Adenovirus; Augmentation; Cryptosporidium; Human Health; Recreation; Water Reuse; Water Conservation; Drinking Water; Surface Water; Health Risk; Infectious Disease; Pathogen; Public Health; Viral Disease; Water Quality; Water Supply; Water Use; Adenoviridae; Adenovirus Infection; Article; Bacteriophage; Bacterium Contamination; Coliphage; Controlled Study; Cryptosporidiosis; Dilution; Enterococcus; Fecal Coliform; Infection Risk; Nonhuman; Priority Journal; Recreation; Risk Assessment; Swimming; Viral Contamination; Waste Water Recycling; Water Contamination; Water Sampling; Animal; Human; Microbiology; Waste Water; Water Management; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroides; Protozoa; Animals; Cryptosporidiosis; Drinking Water; Humans; Waste Water; Water Microbiology; Water Purification,Climate change; Pathogens; Polymerase chain reaction; Potable water; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Salmonella; Surface waters; Viruses; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water supply; Adenovirus; Augmentation; Cryptosporidium; Human health; Recreation; Water reuse; Water conservation; drinking water; surface water; health risk; infectious disease; pathogen; public health; viral disease; water quality; water supply; water use; Adenoviridae; adenovirus infection; Article; bacteriophage; bacterium contamination; coliphage; controlled study; cryptosporidiosis; dilution; Enterococcus; fecal coliform; infection risk; nonhuman; priority journal; recreation; risk assessment; swimming; viral contamination; waste water recycling; water contamination; water sampling; animal; human; microbiology; waste water; water management; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroides; Protozoa; Animals; Cryptosporidiosis; Drinking Water; Humans; Waste Water; Water Microbiology; Water Purification,,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,32197157,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082113688

In Nepal, the Bagmati River serves as a source of drinking and irrigation water; therefore, the detection of waterborne enteric pathogens is integral to maintaining human health. The objective of this study was to quantify the crAssphage marker in surface water samples from the Bagmati River between November 2015 and September 2016. Concentrations of crAssphage were then compared to those of other enteric viruses and indicator organisms found in the samples in order to examine the potential of crAssphage as a marker for fecal contamination. CrAssphage was detected in 17% (1/6) of samples from Sundarijal, 100% (6/6) of samples from Thapathali, and 100% (6/6) samples from Chovar, with the highest average concentrations recorded in May 2016 and the lowest average concentrations recorded in September 2016. Overall, crAssphage was present in 72% (13/18) of samples and was strongly correlated with the presence of fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli (r = 0.89) and Enterococcus (r = 0.92) and several enteric viruses. The strongest viral correlations were to salivirus (r = 0.84), pepper mild mottle virus (r = 0.77), Aichi virus 1 (r = 0.75), enteroviruses (r = 0.76), and tobacco mosaic virus (r = 0.71).

As a largely waterborne disease, emphasis has been given to the study of Cryptosporidium spp. in surface waters, readily susceptible to pathogenic contamination. Conversely, the status of Cryptosporidium in potable groundwater sources, generally regarded as a pristine and “safe” drinking-water supply owing to (sub)-soil protection, remains largely unknown. As such, this investigation presents the first literature review aimed to ascertain the global prevalence of Cryptosporidium in groundwater supply sources intended for human consumption. Thirty-seven peer-reviewed studies were identified and included in the review. Groundwater sample and supply detection rates (estimated 10–20%) indicate Cryptosporidium is frequently present in domestic groundwater sources, representing a latent health concern for groundwater consumers. Specifically, sample (10.4%) and source (19.1%) detection rates deriving from comprehensive “temporal” investigations are put forward as representative of a contamination ‘baseline’ for Cryptosporidium in ‘domestic’ groundwater supplies. Proposed ‘baseline’ prevalence figures are largely applicable in preventive risk-based catchment and groundwater quality management including the formulation of Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA). Notwithstanding, a large geographical disparity in available investigations and lack of standardized reporting restrict the transferability of research findings. Overall, the mechanisms responsible for Cryptosporidium transport and ingress into groundwater supplies remain ambiguous, representing a critical knowledge gap, and denoting a distinctive lack of integration between groundwater and public-health sub-disciplines among investigations.

The Plateau borough (city of Savè) in Benin faces problems of discontinuous access to drinking water due to its geographical location. This study focuses on the quality of drinking water available from source to final storage for domestic use. The Plateau borough has 23 hydraulic structures, 13 of which are non-functional and 10 functional (in good condition), and seven of these were the subject of our study (water sampling at the source for bacteriological analysis). Quantitative data processing was reinforced by documentary research, socio-anthropological surveys, qualitative data from field work, field analysis and laboratory bacteriological analysis on specimens collected during the study: water at the source, during transport, and storage. The sampling technique was divided into two parts: (a) choice of water points (type of structure); and (b) categories of actors submitted to the questionnaires. The results reveal that three types of hydraulic works serve as a source of drinking water for the population: Pumps with human propulsion; standpipes; and populations subscribed to the water distribution network of the Société Nationale des Eaux du Béni. Our analysis of 12 samples of water collected from pumps with human propulsion, standpipes and populations subscribed to the water distribution network found that 58.3% are drinkable and 41.6% are infected, and that links exist between water quality and poor human practices. The indices of infection of Escherichia coli and faecal coliform are all higher than the maximum value authorized by the World Health Organization, set at zero colony-forming units per 100 ml of water (0 CFU/100 ml). Many problems which are confronted in Africa, including Benin, are a consequence of water supply problems, and the results of this study may be useful in the development of policies that could help improve the well-being of communities.

Methods: we analyzed national cholera surveillance data to describe epidemiological patterns and carried out a case-control study to find reasons for the Nairobi county outbreak. Suspected cholera cases were Nairobi residents aged >2 years with acute watery diarrhea (>4 stools/≤12 hours) and illness onset 1-14 May 2015. Confirmed cases had Vibrio cholerae isolated from stool. Case-patients were frequency-matched to persons without diarrhea (1:2 by age group, residence), interviewed using standardized questionaires. Logistic regression identified factors associated with case status. Household water was analyzed for fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli. Results: during December 2014-June 2015, 4,218 cholera cases including 282 (6.7%) confirmed cases and 79 deaths (case-fatality rate [CFR] 1.9%) were reported from 14 of 47 Kenyan counties. Nairobi county reported 781 (19.0 %) cases (attack rate, 18/100,000 persons), including 607 (78%) hospitalisations, 20 deaths (CFR 2.6%) and 55 laboratory-confirmed cases (7.0%). Seven (70%) of 10 water samples from communal water points had coliforms; one had Escherichia coli. Factors associated with cholera in Nairobi were drinking untreated water (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-18.8), lacking health education (aOR 2.4, CI 1.1-7.9) and eating food outside home (aOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-5.7). Conclusion: we recommend safe water, health education, avoiding eating foods prepared outside home and improved sanitation in Nairobi county. Adherence to these practices could have prevented this protacted cholera outbreak.","Case-control; Cholera; County; Kenya; Nairobi; Outbreak; Vibrio Cholerae; Water; Drinking Water; Water; Adolescent; Adult; Article; Case Control Study; Case Fatality Rate; Child; Cholera; Controlled Study; Diarrhea; Disease Course; Escherichia Coli; Fecal Coliform; Feeding Behavior; Female; Health Education; Hospitalization; Human; Kenya; Logistic Regression Analysis; Major Clinical Study; Male; Questionnaire; Urban Area; Urban Population; Vibrio Cholerae; Water Sampling; Epidemic; Infant; Middle Aged; Preschool Child; Risk Factor; Sanitation; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Case-control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Cholera; Diarrhea; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Sanitation; Urban Population; Young Adult","drinking water; water; adolescent; adult; Article; case control study; case fatality rate; child; cholera; controlled study; diarrhea; disease course; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; feeding behavior; female; health education; hospitalization; human; Kenya; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; questionnaire; urban area; urban population; Vibrio cholerae; water sampling; epidemic; infant; middle aged; preschool child; risk factor; sanitation; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Cholera; Diarrhea; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Sanitation; Urban Population; Young Adult",,African Field Epidemiology Network sec@afenet.net,19378688,,,32849982,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089988389

We describe the development and testing of a novel device for the measurement of tryptophan-like fluorescence (TLF), making use of recent advances in deep-ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) and sensitive semiconductor photodiodes and photomultipliers. TLF is an emerging indicator of water quality that is associated with members of the coliform group of bacteria and therefore potential fecal contamination. Following the demonstration of close correlation between TLF and E. coli in model waters and proof of principle with sensitivity of 4 CFU/mL for E. coli, we further developed a two-LED flow-through configuration capable of detecting TLF levels corresponding to ""high risk"" fecal contamination levels (>10 CFU/100 mL).

However, the variation in approaches taken for QMRA in relation to drinking water supply is not well understood. This systematic review identifies, categorises, and critically synthesises peer-reviewed and academic case studies of QMRA implementation for existing distributed public drinking water supplies. Thirty-nine English-language, peer-reviewed and academic studies published from 2003 to 2019 were identified. Key findings were synthesised in narrative form. The overall designs of the included studies varied widely, as did the assumptions used in risk calculation, especially in relation to pathogen dose. There was also substantial variation in the degree to which the use of location-specific data weighed with the use of assumptions when performing risk calculation. In general, the included studies’ complexity did not appear to be associated with greater result certainty. Factors relating to pathogen dose were commonly influential on risk estimates whereas dose-response parameters tended to be of low relative influence. In two of the included studies, use of the ‘susceptible fraction’ factor was inconsistent with recognised guidance and potentially led to the underestimation of risk. While approaches and assumptions used in QMRA need not be standardised, improvement in the reporting of QMRA results and uncertainties would be beneficial. It is recommended that future authors consider the water supply QMRA reporting checklist developed for the current review. Consideration of the broad types of uncertainty relevant to QMRA is also recommended. Policy-makers should consider emergent discussion on acute microbial health-based targets when setting normative guidelines. The continued representation of QMRA case studies within peer-reviewed and academic literature would also enhance future implementation. Further research is needed on the optimisation of QMRA resourcing given the application context.",Distributed Water Supply; Drinking Water; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (qmra); Systematic Review; Drinking Water; Health Risks; Potable Water; Risk Perception; Water Supply; Academic Literature; Application Contexts; Distributed Water; Microbial Health-based Targets; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (qmra); Substantial Variations; Systematic Review; Water-borne Pathogens; Risk Assessment; Drinking Water; Health Risk; Literature Review; Risk Assessment; Risk Factor; Water Supply; Adenoviridae; Bacterial Infection; Campylobacter Jejuni; Controlled Study; Cryptosporidium; Disability-adjusted Life Year; Enterovirus; Escherichia Coli O157; Fecal Coliform; Giardia; Human; Hydrodynamics; Legionella Pneumophila; Nonhuman; Norovirus; Population Health; Priority Journal; Quantitative Analysis; Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment; Review; Rotavirus; Virus Infection; Microbiology; Uncertainty; Drinking Water; Risk Assessment; Uncertainty; Water Microbiology; Water Supply,Health risks; Potable water; Risk perception; Water supply; Academic literature; Application contexts; Distributed water; Microbial health-based targets; Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA); Substantial variations; Systematic Review; Water-borne pathogens; Risk assessment; drinking water; health risk; literature review; risk assessment; risk factor; water supply; Adenoviridae; bacterial infection; Campylobacter jejuni; controlled study; Cryptosporidium; disability-adjusted life year; Enterovirus; Escherichia coli O157; fecal coliform; Giardia; human; hydrodynamics; Legionella pneumophila; nonhuman; Norovirus; population health; priority journal; quantitative analysis; quantitative microbial risk assessment; Review; Rotavirus; virus infection; microbiology; uncertainty; Drinking Water; Risk Assessment; Uncertainty; Water Microbiology; Water Supply,,Elsevier Ltd,00431354; 18792448,,WATRA,32087414,English,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079541050

Data generated from the model were used to propose realistic standards for Salmonella in irrigation water needed for safe crop production. Results demonstrated the presence of total coliforms, fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, and Salmonella in wastewater samples. Salmonella was recorded on lettuce and spinach in 3 different harvesting events, although it was not found in data obtained for parsley plant. The QMRA scenario included surface irrigation, consumption of raw crops, and 1-day withholding period before harvest. The annual risk probability of Salmonella infection for consumers exceeded the target tolerable risk (7.7 × 10−4) for investigated crops. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between different annual risk probabilities showed significant correlation (p < 0.05). The levels of risk posed from spinach and lettuce were roughly similar, although they tended to be higher for lettuce. The optimum concentrations of Salmonella in irrigation water needed to satisfy the World Health Organization guidelines of disease burden (disability-adjusted life years 10−6) per person per year ranged from 34 to 119 via multiple-tube fermentation technique/100 mL, for spinach and lettuce plants, respectively. The study concluded that unofficial reuse of wastewater in irrigation is a principle route for crop contamination. Water quality monitoring programs should be integrated with QMRA investigations for better estimation of risk level. The fit parameters used could be tailored to cover a wide array of local situations in different countries. Models applied for viruses, helminths, and bacteria other than Salmonella are encouraged in future studies.

Disease outcome is the result of complex interactions between the host and pathogens. Such interactions lie at the core of future management strategies of enteric diseases. In developed countries of the world, Giardia duodenalis is a common cause of diarrheal disease. In contrast, giardiasis appears to protect children against diarrhea in countries with poor sanitation, via obscure mechanisms. We hypothesized that Giardia may protect its host from disease induced by a co-infecting pathogen such as attaching and effacing Escherichia coli. This enteropathogen is commonly implicated in pediatric diarrhea in developing countries. The findings indicate that co-infection with Giardia attenuates the severity of disease induced by Citrobacter rodentium, an equivalent of A/E E. coli in mice. Co-infection with Giardia reduced colitis, blood in stools, fecal softening, bacterial invasion, and weight loss; the protective effects were lost when co-infection occurred in Nod-like receptor pyrin-containing 3 knockout mice. In co-infected mice, elevated levels of antimicrobial peptides Murine β defensin 3 and Trefoil Factor 3, and enhanced bacterial killing, were NLRP3-dependent. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome in human enterocytes blocked the activation of AMPs and bacterial killing. The findings uncover novel NLRP3-dependent modulatory mechanisms during co-infections with Giardia spp. and A/E enteropathogens, and demonstrate how these interactions may regulate the severity of enteric disease.","Antimicrobial Peptides; Citrobacter Rodentium; Escherichia Coli Epec; Giardia Duodenalis; Giardiasis; Immunomodulation; Inflammasome; Polymicrobial Infection; Myeloperoxidase; Rna; Inflammasomes; Nlr Family, Pyrin Domain-containing 3 Protein; Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins; Beta Defensin 3; Cryopyrin; Myeloperoxidase; Polypeptide Antibiotic Agent; Rna; Trefoil Factor 3; Inflammasome; Pore Forming Cytotoxic Protein; Diarrheal Disease; Disease; Pathogen; Peptide; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Article; Bactericidal Activity; Bacterium Culture; Body Weight Loss; Caco-2 Cell Line; Citrobacter Rodentium; Colitis; Controlled Study; Disease Severity; Enteropathogen; Enteropathogenic Escherichia Coli; Enzyme Activity; Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization; Giardia; Giardia Intestinalis; Giardia Muris; Giardiasis; Human; Human Cell; Immunofluorescence; Innate Immunity; Intestine Cell; Knockout Mouse; Mixed Infection; Mouse; Nonhuman; Protein Induction; Rectum Hemorrhage; Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rna Extraction; Wild Type; Animal; Diarrhea; Escherichia Coli; Host Parasite Interaction; Immunology; Intestine Mucosa; Metabolism; Microbiology; Organismal Interaction; Pathogenicity; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lotus; Murinae; Mus; Animals; Coinfection; Colitis; Diarrhea; Enterocytes; Host-parasite Interactions; Immunity, Innate; Inflammasomes; Intestinal Mucosa; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Microbial Interactions; Nlr Family, Pyrin Domain-containing 3 Protein; Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins","beta defensin 3; cryopyrin; myeloperoxidase; polypeptide antibiotic agent; RNA; trefoil factor 3; inflammasome; pore forming cytotoxic protein; diarrheal disease; disease; pathogen; peptide; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bactericidal activity; bacterium culture; body weight loss; Caco-2 cell line; Citrobacter rodentium; colitis; controlled study; disease severity; enteropathogen; enteropathogenic Escherichia coli; enzyme activity; fluorescence in situ hybridization; Giardia; Giardia intestinalis; Giardia muris; giardiasis; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; innate immunity; intestine cell; knockout mouse; mixed infection; mouse; nonhuman; protein induction; rectum hemorrhage; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; wild type; animal; diarrhea; Escherichia coli; host parasite interaction; immunology; intestine mucosa; metabolism; microbiology; organismal interaction; pathogenicity; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lotus; Murinae; Mus; Animals; Coinfection; Colitis; Diarrhea; Enterocytes; Host-Parasite Interactions; Immunity, Innate; Inflammasomes; Intestinal Mucosa; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Microbial Interactions; NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein; Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins",,Elsevier Ltd,00207519; 18790135,,IJPYB,32184085,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082507131

Here we conducted a comprehensive survey of 44 homes supplied by private wells in Wake County, North Carolina, quantifying Legionella spp. DNA, Legionella pneumophila DNA, and total bacterial 16S rRNA genes via real-time polymerase chain reaction in hot and cold drinking water samples, along with culturable L. pneumophila via IDEXX Legiolert in cold drinking water samples. Legionella spp. DNA, L. pneumophila DNA and culturable L. pneumophila were detected in 100, 65·5 and 15·9% of the 44 homes, respectively, and culturable levels were comparable to some municipal surveys applying the same methods. Total coliforms and Escherichia coli were monitored as representative faecal indicators and were found in 20·4 and 0·0% of homes. Within certain sample types, Legionella spp. and L. pneumophila gene copy numbers were positively associated with total bacteria (i.e. total 16S rRNA genes) and water softener use, but were not associated with faecal indicator bacteria, inorganic water parameters or other well characteristics. These findings confirm that occurrence of Legionella and L. pneumophila is highly variable in private wells. Significance and Impact of the Study: Legionella is the leading identified cause of waterborne disease outbreaks associated with US municipal water systems. While Legionella is known to occur naturally in groundwater, prior efforts to characterize its occurrence in unregulated private wells are limited to sampling at the wellhead and not in the home plumbing where Legionella can thrive. This work documents much higher levels of Legionella in home plumbing versus water directly from private wells and examines factors associated with higher Legionella occurrence.","Drinking Water; Groundwater; Legionella Pneumophila; Premise Plumbing; Private Wells; Water Quality; Dna, Bacterial; Drinking Water; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Escherichia Coli; Genes; Groundwater; Plumbing; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Potable Water; Rna; Water Quality; 16s Rrna Gene; Culturable; Drinking Water Samples; Legionella Pneumophila; Legionella Spp; Legionellae; Legionnaire's Disease; Potential Sources; Premise Plumbings; Private Wells; Dna; Bacterial Dna; Drinking Water; Ground Water; Hot Water; Rna 16s; Well Water; Detection Method; Fecal Coliform; Inorganic Compound; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Real Time; Sampling; Water Quality; Article; Bacterial Gene; Bacterium Contamination; Bacterium Culture; Cold; Coliform Bacterium; Controlled Study; Gene Dosage; Legionnaire Disease; Nonhuman; North Carolina; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Water Borne Disease; Water Contamination; Water Supply; Water Temperature; Classification; Genetics; Human; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Sanitation; United States; Wake County; Bacteria (microorganisms); Legionella; Dna, Bacterial; Drinking Water; Humans; Legionnaires' Disease; Rna, Ribosomal, 16s; Sanitary Engineering; Water Microbiology; Water Supply","Escherichia coli; Genes; Groundwater; Plumbing; Polymerase chain reaction; Potable water; RNA; Water quality; 16S rRNA gene; Culturable; Drinking water samples; Legionella pneumophila; Legionella spp; Legionellae; Legionnaire's disease; Potential sources; Premise plumbings; Private wells; DNA; bacterial DNA; drinking water; ground water; hot water; RNA 16S; well water; detection method; fecal coliform; inorganic compound; polymerase chain reaction; real time; sampling; water quality; Article; bacterial gene; bacterium contamination; bacterium culture; cold; coliform bacterium; controlled study; gene dosage; legionnaire disease; nonhuman; North Carolina; real time polymerase chain reaction; water borne disease; water contamination; water supply; water temperature; classification; genetics; human; isolation and purification; microbiology; sanitation; United States; Wake County; Bacteria (microorganisms); Legionella; DNA, Bacterial; Drinking Water; Humans; Legionnaires' Disease; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sanitary Engineering; Water Microbiology; Water Supply",,John Wiley and Sons Inc,1472765X; 02668254,,LAMIE,31904109,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081710267

However, the relative importance of different exposure points for pathogen transmission both inside and outside households is not well understood. We conducted a cross-sectional study in the urban slum of Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya, collecting 237 environmental samples from 40 households from source water, stored drinking water, caregiver hands, child hands, household surfaces, soil, standing water, open drainage ditches, and streams. We quantified the fecal indicator Escherichia coli and the enteric pathogens of adenovirus, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella spp./enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), and Vibrio cholerae. At least one enteric pathogens was detected in 13% of household stored water, 47% of hand, 46% of table surface, 26% of plate surface, 75% of floor surface, 96% of soil, 56% of standing water, 77% of drainage ditch, and 100% of stream samples despite all households having access to a toilet or latrine. Our results provide evidence that children may be exposed to enteric pathogens from several exposure points, that domestic hygiene practices related to water treatment and child handwashing were associated with reduced pathogen detection in this setting, but household table and floor cleaning practices were not, that ownership or presence of chickens in the compound was associated with increased detection of C. jejuni inside households and on soil, that there were interactions among different transmission pathways for enteric pathogens, and that there were differential correlations between E. coli and enteric pathogens for different pathogens and environmental sample types. Additionally, V. cholerae was detected at several exposure points during a cholera outbreak. Overall, these results suggest that interventions that can disrupt many transmission pathways may be needed to reduce enteric pathogen exposure in this urban slum setting.",Diarrheal Disease; Enteric Pathogens; Fecal Contamination; Hygiene; Sanitation; Water; Soil; Water; Cleaning; Escherichia Coli; Floors; Housing; Potable Water; Rivers; Sanitation; Soils; Water Pollution; Water Treatment; Campylobacter Jejuni; Cross-sectional Study; Differential Correlation; Enteric Pathogens; Environmental Sample; Fecal Contamination; Hygiene; Pathogen Detection; Pathogens; Drinking Water; Water; Coliform Bacterium; Diarrheal Disease; Drainage; Feces; Hygiene; Neighborhood; Pathogen; Quantitative Analysis; Sanitation; Soil Pollution; Stream; Adenoviridae; Article; Bacterial Transmission; Bacterium Detection; Caregiver; Chicken; Cleaning; Controlled Study; Cross-sectional Study; Drainage Ditch; Enteroinvasive Escherichia Coli; Enteropathogen; Environmental Sanitation; Hand; Hand Washing; Household; Human; Kenya; Land Drainage; Lowest Income Group; Nonhuman; Poverty; Priority Journal; Shigella; Soil Microflora; Stream (river); Surface Property; Urban Area; Vibrio Cholerae; Water Treatment; Animal; Child; River; Soil; Kibera; Nairobi [kenya]; Nairobi [nairobi (cnt)]; Gallus Gallus; Animals; Chickens; Child; Cross-sectional Studies; Feces; Humans; Soil; Water,Cleaning; Escherichia coli; Floors; Housing; Potable water; Rivers; Sanitation; Soils; Water pollution; Water treatment; Campylobacter jejuni; Cross-sectional study; Differential correlation; Enteric pathogens; Environmental sample; Fecal contamination; Hygiene; Pathogen detection; Pathogens; drinking water; water; coliform bacterium; diarrheal disease; drainage; feces; hygiene; neighborhood; pathogen; quantitative analysis; sanitation; soil pollution; stream; Adenoviridae; Article; bacterial transmission; bacterium detection; caregiver; chicken; cleaning; controlled study; cross-sectional study; drainage ditch; enteroinvasive Escherichia coli; enteropathogen; environmental sanitation; hand; hand washing; household; human; Kenya; land drainage; lowest income group; nonhuman; poverty; priority journal; Shigella; soil microflora; stream (river); surface property; urban area; Vibrio cholerae; water treatment; animal; child; river; soil; Kibera; Nairobi [Kenya]; Nairobi [Nairobi (CNT)]; Gallus gallus; Animals; Chickens; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Feces; Humans; Soil; Water,,Elsevier B.V.,00489697; 18791026,,STEVA,31874341,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076843847

The groundwater in TADLA aquifer is the main water source in the region, which is mainly used in agriculture, industry, and as a source of drinking water. This study was carried out in TADLA region, in Beni-Mellal-khenifra province, where the study area extends over a large surface of 3,600 km2, of the middle basin of Oum-er-Rbia. This study aims to assess the state of microbial contamination of the groundwater in the irrigated area of TADLA plain. this study has done between March 2017 and May 2018, where samples of water from forty-three wells were analyzed in every three-months to extract the rate of pollutions indicators, and precisely, total coliforms (TC), faecal coliforms (FC) and faecal streptococci (FS), using the membrane filter (MF) method and a spatial-temporal mapping in order to map the microbial concentration variation. The results show a positive testing in all wells with more than one colony-forming unit (CFU), and reveal a significant groundwater contamination caused by microbial agents. The analyzes of water samples show that 95.34% of TC, 86.04% of FC and 55.81% of FS exceed 1000 CFU/100mL in every TC, FC, and FS group. The spatial maps show a variation of microbial concentration due to the climate and anthropogenic factors, with high concentration in the Nord-Est and Nord-Ouest of TADLA aquifer.

Poor quality of water can cause waterborne diseases through bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and parasites that has been responsible for millions of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, this study aimed to assess quality and safety of public municipal drinking water in Addis Ababa City. Methods: Descriptive epidemiological study design that used quantitative approach was carried out at Addis Ababa City Administration from June 2016 to October 2016. Pre-tested and standardized aseptic sample collection technique was utilized to collect a total of 2976 samples (2951 water samples for bacteriological analysis by Presence-Absence (P-A) culturing method and 25 samples for parasites identification through direct microscopy examination). Descriptive data were summarized and cleaned by the SPSS version 20 software and presented in table and graph. Results: The study revealed that 10%, 7% and 3% were positive for bacteriological, total coliforms, and fecal coliforms respectively through Presence-Absence Broth test. The bacterial distribution trends from 1st to 13th weeks of wet season were slight increment of total coliforms and slight decrement for fecal coliforms. All tested for parasitological samples from selected reservoirs were free from parasitological species. Conclusion: This study reflects that there were positive for bacterial, total coliforms, and fecal coliforms during the study period.

Enteric illness outbreaks, and the occurrence of dermatitis and mycoses during the summer season in leisure areas, were usually related to seawater pollution. Pathogenic microorganisms can reach coastal areas through sewage discharges, compromising marine water, and beach quality. Although sand transmission of enteric illness is still unclear, there is an expressed concern that sand may act as reservoirs or vectors for humans infection. In this context, the main hypotheses of this study were: (i) fecal coliforms density changes within beach compartments; (ii) dry sand is the most contaminated beach compartment; (ii) fecal coliforms densities are within international standard limits for sand. Therefore, this case study quantified and compared within three months total fecal bacteria (TC) and thermotolerant coliforms (TEC) densities in seawater, wet, and dry sand of a chosen touristic beach from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Furthermore, to contribute to coastal beach management, sand contamination data surveyed were compared with the standard limits ruling worldwide until April 2018 to check suitableness. Vermelha beach should be considered as a reference beach for sand monitoring in Brazil. Despite being a buffer zone from the MONA Pão Açucar conservation unit, it is subjected to intense touristic pressure. Even though, fecal bacteria densities quantified in Vermelha beach were within the standards of “excellent” quality sand and water according to current legislation/guidelines. However, dry sand was the most contaminated compartment, followed by seawater and wet sand. The bacterial density in dry sand was up to 4,600 times higher than wet sand. Except for Rio de Janeiro city, recreational guidelines for beach quality is exclusive for seawater contamination. There are no established parameters for recreational beach sand classification, only recommendations, including Portugal. Monitoring recreational beach dry sand is critical to reducing the risk of beachgoer exposure to pathogens.",Fecal Bacteria; Guidelines; Rain; Thermotolerant Coliforms,,,Centro Universitario de Anapolis pedrovcravo@gmail.com,22388869,,,,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081248706

Results showed that physicochemical parameters were within the safe limits of drinking water guidelines set by the World Health Organization. However, drinking water was found severely contaminated with gastrointestinal flora (fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli) and infectious bacterial agents (Salmonella spp. Shigella spp. Vibrio cholera, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). High levels of bacterial contamination may pose potential threats to the local community and could result in waterborne diseases.

We determined the physicochemical and microbiological water quality of a highly used bathing site in southern Ecuador. We assessed how bather attendance, rainfall events, and pool location alters the recreational water quality (RWQ). Most of the parameters measured in the stream pools did not accomplish the Ecuadorian and international regulations for recreational water quality. Microbiological water quality diminishes from upstream to downstream pools because of human activities and bathing intensity having potential effects on bather health and eco-touristic development. We found that an increase of bathers is strongly associated with a growing concentration of Escherichia coli. It is suggested better land-use practices and review thoroughly the Ecuadorian regulation to assure a healthy RWQ.

This study contributes to a better understanding of the effects of urban and recreational surfaces on the occurrence of waterborne pathogens. The inactivation of selected indicator organisms was studied under controlled exposure to artificial sunlight for 6 h followed by 18 h in dark conditions. Concrete, asphalt, pavement blocks and glass as control were inoculated with artificial floodwater containing, as indicator organisms, Escherichia coli bacteria, which are common faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) for water quality assessment, Bacillus subtilis spores chosen as surrogates for Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and Giardia cysts, and bacteriophages MS2 as indicators for viral contamination. On practically all the surfaces in this study, E. coli had the highest inactivation under light conditions followed by MS2 and B. subtilis, except asphalt where MS2 was inactivated faster. The highest inactivation under light conditions was seen with E. coli on a concrete surface (pH 9.6) with an inactivation rate of 1.85 h−1. However, the pH of the surfaces (varying between 7.0 and 9.6) did not have any influence on inactivation rates under dark conditions. MS2 bacteriophage had the highest inactivation under light conditions on asphalt with a rate of 1.29 h−1. No die-off of B. subtilis spores was observed on any of the surfaces during the experiment, neither in light nor in dark conditions.

Hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS), caused by virulent fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4), is another highly infectious disease in chickens with severe economic impact. The effective way to combat ND and HHS is by vaccinating the poultry. In the present study, a recombinant NDV LaSota vaccine strain expressing full length fiber-2 gene of FAdV-4 (rLaSota-fiber2) was generated using reverse genetics. The FAdV-4 fiber-2 protein was expressed as a soluble form rather than NDV membrane-anchored form. The rLaSota-fiber2 was genetically stable, and it showed growth patterns in embryonated eggs comparable to that of parental rLaSota virus. Since our unpublished data demonstrated that delivery of live rLaSota-fiber2 in drinking water or ocular delivery of the vaccine didn't produce protection against hypervirulent FAdV-4 challenge, even though the vaccine provide full protection against NDV challenge, the efficacy of the rLaSota-fiber2 was evaluated by delivering the vaccine intramuscularly in this study. Single-dose intramuscular vaccination of 2-week-old SPF White Leghorn chicks with the live or inactivated rLaSota-fiber2 provided complete protection against virulent NDV challenge. However, single-dose intramuscular vaccination with the live rLaSota-fiber2 vaccine provided better protection against virulent FAdV-4 challenge and significantly reduced faecal viral shedding comparing to the inactivated vaccine. These results indicate that the NDV-vectored FAdV-4 vaccine is a promising bivalent vaccine candidate to control both HHS and ND.","Fiber-2; Fowl Adenovirus Serotype 4; Hepatitis-hydropericardium Syndrome; Lasota Vaccine Strain; Newcastle Disease; Recombinant Ndv; Antibodies, Viral; Viral Vaccines; Fiber 2 Protein; Newcastle Disease Vaccine; Unclassified Drug; Virus Fiber Protein; Virus Antibody; Virus Vaccine; Adenovirus Infection; Animal Cell; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Article; Aviadenovirus; Chicken; Controlled Study; Fowl Adenovirus Serotype 4; Gene Expression; Hepatitis Hydropericardium Syndrome; Human; Human Cell; Immunity; Immunogenicity; Newcastle Disease; Newcastle Disease Virus; Nonhuman; Oocyte Development; Priority Journal; Reverse Genetics; Single Drug Dose; Virus Shedding; Virus Strain; Adenoviridae; Animal; Animal Hepatitis; Bird Disease; Genetics; Immunology; Intramuscular Drug Administration; Serotype; Virology; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Chickens; Hepatitis, Viral, Animal; Injections, Intramuscular; Newcastle Disease; Poultry Diseases; Reverse Genetics; Serogroup; Viral Vaccines; Virus Shedding","fiber 2 protein; Newcastle disease vaccine; unclassified drug; virus fiber protein; virus antibody; virus vaccine; adenovirus infection; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; Aviadenovirus; chicken; controlled study; Fowl adenovirus serotype 4; gene expression; hepatitis hydropericardium syndrome; human; human cell; immunity; immunogenicity; Newcastle disease; Newcastle disease virus; nonhuman; oocyte development; priority journal; reverse genetics; single drug dose; virus shedding; virus strain; Adenoviridae; animal; animal hepatitis; bird disease; genetics; immunology; intramuscular drug administration; serotype; virology; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Chickens; Hepatitis, Viral, Animal; Injections, Intramuscular; Newcastle Disease; Poultry Diseases; Reverse Genetics; Serogroup; Viral Vaccines; Virus Shedding",,Elsevier Ltd,0264410X; 18732518,,VACCD,31948818,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077741168

As there exists little systematic surveillance for enteric infections or outbreaks related to well water sources, consumers may be at risk of waterborne infectious diseases. A standard protocol in Ontario requires 200 mL of water, collected, and submitted by well owners, half of which is used to analyze for Escherichia coli and total coliforms (TCs). The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of testing small water volumes and to survey for other contaminants in addition to bacterial indicators to inform pathogen prevalence and fecal source in drinking water wells. Samples were assessed for E. coli and TCs, by culture, and genetic markers of Bacteroides spp., Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, using qPCR. The source of fecal contamination varied by the geographic region and may be explained by septic tank density and underlying geology, among other factors. A small number of samples (1.9%) showed the evidence of contamination with enteric pathogens. Lastly, E. coli measured by qPCR, as opposed to culture, correlated more strongly to Bacteroides markers.",Bacteroides; Microbial Source Tracking (mst); Private Water Wells; Public Health; Qpcr; Waterborne Pathogen; Escherichia Coli; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Potable Water; Water Quality; Water Wells; Well Testing; Bacterial Indicators; Enteric Pathogens; Fecal Contamination; Human Health Impacts; Microbial Water Quality; Shiga Toxin-producing E.

This study aimed to determine the host-specific fecal contamination in two Brazilian watersheds and to predict the possible impacts on human health. Fecal sources were enumerated using host-specific genetic markers to swine (16S rRNA), human and bovine (archaeal nifH), and equine (archaeal mcrA). A single cycling condition was established for four markers aiming to decrease the analysis time. Fifteen samples from São João watershed (75%) and 25 from Guandu (62.5%) presenting Escherichia coli enumeration in compliance with Brazilian guidelines (<1,000 MPN/100 mL) showed the human marker. Furthermore, the bovine, swine, and equine markers were present in 92% (59/64), 89% (57/64), and 81% (52/64) of the water samples, respectively. The molecular markers proposed for qPCR in our study were sensitivity and specific enough to detect host-specific fecal pollution in all samples regardless of E. coli levels reaffirming the low correlation among them and supporting their use in water quality monitoring programs.

Among waterborne bacteria, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) should be highlighted. This study targeted the evaluation of enteropathogenic (EPEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), and shiga toxin-producing (STEC)/enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli in drinking water in Southeast Brazil and the georeferencing of generated data. A total of 1185 water samples were studied. Among them 7.8% and 4.1% gave positive results for total and fecal coliforms, respectively. By employing PCR, a total of 12 diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC) isolates (6 ETEC, 4 STEC, and 2 EPEC) from eight water samples (4, 2, and 2 positives for STEC, ETEC, and EPEC, respectively) were detected including samples collected in schools and a healthcare facility where particularly susceptible hosts are found. Data generated were submitted to georeferencing. A positive correlation (r2 = 0.9) between DEC detection and the rainy period was observed. The presence of DEC in drinking water samples in the studied municipalities highlights the relevance of controlling the sources of human and animal fecal pollution, as well as the management of municipal wastewater sources in order to reduce potential risks to human health.

So far, only PFOA has been shown to have a positive association with ulcerative colitis. The present study aimed to investigate the association of PFAS and clinically diagnosed IBD in the Ronneby cohort, a population with high PFAS exposure (especially high PFOS and PFHxS) from Aqueous Film-Forming Foam through drinking water, using registry data. Additionally, to explore associations of PFAS with fecal zonulin and calprotectin, subclinical biomarkers of gut inflammation and permeability, in a sub-set of participants from Ronneby and Karlshamn (a nearby control municipality). The registry study included all people that ever resided in Ronneby municipality at least one year between 1980 and 2013. Yearly exposure to contaminated drinking water was assessed based on residential addresses and waterworks supply data, and the population classified by early, mid and late periods in ascending level of contamination. Diagnosed IBD cases were retrieved from the Swedish National Patient register and cause-of-death register. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to derive the hazard ratios (HRs) for diagnosed IBD. The biomarker study included 189 individuals who provided fecal samples. Serum PFAS were measured using LC-MS/MS. Fecal zonulin and calprotectin were measured using ELISA. Linear regression was used to assess the associations between measured PFAS and biomarker levels. In the registry study, no raised HRs for diagnosed IBD were found for cohort subjects with mid (1995–2004) or late period (2005–2013) exposure compared to never exposure. Early period exposure only (1985–1994) showed raised HRs for Crohn's disease (HR = 1.58, p = 0.048) and other non-specified IBD (HR = 1.38, p = 0.037). In the biomarker study, Karlshamn showed higher fecal calprotectin levels (median = 99.6 mg/kg in Karlshamn vs. 66.8 mg/kg in Ronneby, p = 0.04). A trend of decreased calprotectin with increased serum PFAS indicated higher PFAS was associated with lower degree of gut inflammation (p = 0.002).

CAC is a type of colorectal cancer (CRC), the third leading cause of cancer death. Ziziphus jujuba (ZJ) fruit contains bioactive components such as polysaccharides, triterpenoid acid, and flavonoids, and it has shown anti-inflammatory property. The aim of the study was to investigate the protective effect of dietary ZJ on colitis-associated colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. Mice (n = 42, two sets) were injected with azoxymethane (AOM) followed by three cycles of 2% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water to induce CAC. Simultaneously, those mice were fed with ZJ diet for 70 days (5% or 10% w/w). Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by LSD Bonferroni test. Dietary ZJ decreased fecal blood, diarrhea, disease activity index (DAI), spleen weight (P < 0.001), and the number of tumors (P < 0.001). In addition, dietary ZJ increased colon length (P < 0.001) and suppressed the activation of NF-кB/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. In conclusion, we suggest that dietary ZJ attenuates inflammation by interfering NF-κB/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway, thereby inhibits AOM/DSS-induced colon tumorigenesis in mice.","Azoxymethane; Hemoglobin; Mucin 1; Protein Bcl 2; Azoxymethane; Carcinogens; Interleukin-6; Interleukin-6, Mouse; Jak1 Protein, Mouse; Janus Kinase 1; Plant Extracts; Rela Protein, Mouse; Stat3 Protein, Mouse; Stat3 Transcription Factor; Transcription Factor Rela; Azoxymethane; Drinking Water; Hemoglobin; Herbaceous Agent; Immunoglobulin Enhancer Binding Protein; Interleukin 6; Janus Kinase 1; Mucin 1; Protein Bax; Protein Bcl 2; Stat3 Protein; Carcinogen; Interleukin-6, Mouse; Jak1 Protein, Mouse; Plant Extract; Rela Protein, Mouse; Stat3 Protein, Mouse; Transcription Factor Rela; Animal Cell; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Antitumorigenic Activity; Apoptosis; Article; Body Weight Loss; Cancer Inhibition; Carcinogenesis; Colon Length; Colorectal Cancer; Colorectal Carcinoma; Controlled Study; Cytokine Production; Dextran Sulfate Sodium-induced Colitis; Diarrhea; Diet Therapy; Digestive Tract Parameters; Disease Activity; Disease Severity; Dried Food; Erythrocyte Count; Hematocrit; Hemoglobin Blood Level; Jak-stat Signaling; Jujube; Mortality Rate; Mouse; Nonhuman; Occult Blood; Protein Function; Protein Synthesis Inhibition; Rectum Hemorrhage; Spleen Weight; Tumor Number; Animal; C57bl Mouse; Cell Transformation; Chemistry; Chemoprophylaxis; Colitis; Colon Tumor; Complication; Disease Model; Drug Effect; Fruit; Metabolism; Pathology; Signal Transduction; Ziziphus; Animals; Azoxymethane; Carcinogens; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Chemoprevention; Colitis; Colonic Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; Fruit; Interleukin-6; Janus Kinase 1; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57bl; Plant Extracts; Signal Transduction; Stat3 Transcription Factor; Transcription Factor Rela","azoxymethane; drinking water; hemoglobin; herbaceous agent; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 6; Janus kinase 1; mucin 1; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; STAT3 protein; carcinogen; interleukin-6, mouse; Jak1 protein, mouse; plant extract; Rela protein, mouse; Stat3 protein, mouse; transcription factor RelA; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antitumorigenic activity; apoptosis; Article; body weight loss; cancer inhibition; carcinogenesis; colon length; colorectal cancer; colorectal carcinoma; controlled study; cytokine production; dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis; diarrhea; diet therapy; digestive tract parameters; disease activity; disease severity; dried food; erythrocyte count; hematocrit; hemoglobin blood level; JAK-STAT signaling; jujube; mortality rate; mouse; nonhuman; occult blood; protein function; protein synthesis inhibition; rectum hemorrhage; spleen weight; tumor number; animal; C57BL mouse; cell transformation; chemistry; chemoprophylaxis; colitis; colon tumor; complication; disease model; drug effect; fruit; metabolism; pathology; signal transduction; Ziziphus; Animals; Azoxymethane; Carcinogens; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Chemoprevention; Colitis; Colonic Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; Fruit; Interleukin-6; Janus Kinase 1; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Plant Extracts; Signal Transduction; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Transcription Factor RelA",,Routledge aabs@uw.edu,01635581; 15327914,9781405190428; 9781118788707,NUCAD,31135224,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075720355

Bacterial contamination of potable water resources is the most recurrent health hazard. The present investigation reveals bacteriological evaluation of drinking water sources in and around Pune City, Maharashtra, India. Residential areas of Pune get their drinking water supply from various sources like treated water from corporation purification plant, bore wells, hand pumps, wells etc. A total of 240 water samples were collected from different areas. The areas covered were from Kothrud to Aundh, Pashan to Katraj, Bhosari, Pimpri, Nigdi and the central Pune city. A questionnaire was prepared to collect information regarding source of drinking water, purification method performed, storage of water, and any infection experienced due to drinking water. About 80% samples showed presence of coliforms up to 1800 coliforms/100 mL. Since the total coliforms test is a primary indicator of POTABILITY, i.e. suitability of drinking water for consumption, the results indicate that the drinking water available in and around Pune city is not at all safe for human health. 38% of the drinking water samples examined on a single water supply line showed presence of coliforms which indicate that the water has got contaminated somewhere in the piped drinking-water distribution system. Fecal coliforms indicated water contaminated with animal or human waste, i.e. feces in many samples. Since faecal coliforms have been examined in filtered drinking water samples efficiency of domestic filters is also questionable with regard to killing of coliforms. Most of the samples taken from proper Pune city showed presence of less coliforms. So, in the present research it is concluded that the potable water in Pune is contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms and is unfit for drinking.",Coliforms; Microbiological Analysis; Potable Water; Waterborne Pathogens; Accuracy Assessment; Assessment Method; Disease Transmission; Disease Treatment; Drinking Water; Pollutant Source; Public Health; Purification; Urban Area; Water Supply; Waterborne Disease; India; Maharashtra; Pune; Bacteria (microorganisms); Environmental Samples (proper); Indicator Indicator,accuracy assessment; assessment method; disease transmission; disease treatment; drinking water; pollutant source; public health; purification; urban area; water supply; waterborne disease; India; Maharashtra; Pune; Bacteria (microorganisms); environmental samples (proper); Indicator indicator,,EM International,02578050,,PORSD,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85132456348

The measured indexes, such as total dissolved solid (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), total suspended solid (TSS), Mn, Zn, Al, Fe, Cu, Cr, and Hg etc, mostly have very high concentrations which are higher than permissible limit, indicating that the canal water is completely unsuitable for human consumption. Furthermore, the biological analysis shows that the total coliform (TC) is in the range of 45.9~30.2 in per 100 mL water in April, 30.5~25.3/100 mL in July and 52.9~35.4/100 mL in December, respectively.

The indigenes of the study area, as well as other dwellers in rural areas, consume water from these sources whose quality is unknown; thus, it can lead to contamination and waterborne diseases. Three springs and two streams of Alatening village were investigated in early December 2017 and late July 2018 for organoleptic, physicochemical, and bacteriological parameters using standard methods. The petrographic studies revealed trachyte and benmoreite, and weathering of minerals from these rocks into the soil leads to the water-rock interaction, thus water hydrogeochemistry. All the water samples were clean except that of Alabong which had slight odour due to leaf fall. pH showed acidic water with the springs of Ngog and Alabong falling below the WHO limit in the dry season. Electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids (TDS) were low implying low mineralised water which can also lead to shortage of important minerals in humans. All the essential ions were found within the WHO guideline values without any significant change in concentrations between seasons (p>0.05). The water facies were such as Mg-Ca, Cl-Ca, and HCO3-CO3, suggesting an influence of rock silicate weathering and anthropogenic influence. Aluminium and iron contents were above the WHO limit in both seasons due to their abundance in the soils which could be a risk factor for the local population. Faecal coliforms as well as specific bacteria such as Enterobacter, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, Salmonella, and Shigella were found in all the water samples, attributable to poor hygiene. Health data in the locality indicated the prevalence of typhoid, dysentery, and amoebiasis with a total of 2702 cases recorded between 2016 and 2017, therefore requiring treatment before consumption.",,,,Hindawi Limited,16877667; 16877675,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097301080

Both of the samples were found to be contaminated with heterotrophic bacteria up to 108 cfu/ml. Most of the bacteria were found to be resistant against more than one drug. Hence, the municipal water of the study area was microbiologically unsafe. The propagation of drug resistant strains was assumed to escalate the public health threat. A survey on public opinions were also conducted to know their daily life style and their concern on water treatment and diseases outbreaks caused by contaminated water.",Drug Resistant; Water Borne Diseases; Water Microbiology; Water Pollution; Water Purification,,,Japan Society on Water Environment,13482165,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85095566492

Limited information is available on the presence of HAV, with particular reference to drinking water supplies of primary schools in Sindh, Pakistan. Objectives: The present study estimated the risk of HAV infection through drinking water sources using Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) in primary schools of Sindh, Pakistan. Methods: The QMRA model was applied to estimate the potential health risks of HAV using indicator organisms, i.e., fecal coliforms. Microbial analysis was conducted using a membrane filtration method. The exponential dose-response model was used to calculate the probability of infection. Results: The highest daily risk of HAV infection for schoolchildren was calculated as 35.0 per 10,000 schoolchildren in Karachi district with an annual risk of 66%, whereas the lowest risk was 3.0 per 10,000 schoolchildren in Larkana with 7.8% of the annual risk. The mortality risk due to HAV ranged from 4.0 to 29 deaths per 10,000 children per year. Conclusions: Overall, the drinking water quality of primary schools of Sindh was found very poor. The estimated daily and annual risks of hepatitis A to primary school children were moderate to high. To halt enteric virus transmission through drinking water sources, there is a dire need to invest in the provision of comprehensive water sanitation and hygiene facilities at schools.",Drinking Water; Enteric Virus; Health Risk; Hepatitis A; Drinking Water; Article; Child; Coliform Bacterium; Colony Forming Unit; Feces; Hepatitis A; Human; Infection Risk; Microbiological Examination; Morbidity; Mortality Risk; Pakistan; Prevalence; Primary School; Probability; Risk Assessment; Viral Contamination; Water Supply,drinking water; Article; child; coliform bacterium; colony forming unit; feces; hepatitis A; human; infection risk; microbiological examination; morbidity; mortality risk; Pakistan; prevalence; primary school; probability; risk assessment; viral contamination; water supply,,Kowsar Medical Institute,1735143X; 17353408,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086713117
